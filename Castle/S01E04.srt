10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,060
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>在我喝过的咖啡里
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>This is quite possibly the worst coffee

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,150
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>这个恐怕是最难喝的
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>I've ever tasted.

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>这味道让我印象深刻
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>It's actually kind of fascinating.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,700
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>像是猴子尿混着电瓶水
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>It tastes like a monkey peed in battery acid.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,500
<1-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>你今天就没有新书发售或其他事做吗

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,000
<1-4,BECKETT>怎么啦  你这样盯着我写报告
<1-4,BECKETT>So? You are watching the paperwork.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,600
<1-4,BECKETT>相当怪异
<1-4,BECKETT>It's creepy.

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,300
<1-4,BECKETT>你难道没有别的地方可去了吗
<1-4,BECKETT>Don't you have somewhere else to be?

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,300
<1-5,CASTLE>我喜欢这里

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,600
<1-6,BECKETT>你在逃避
<1-6,BECKETT>You're hiding.

<1-6,BECKETT>今天你的新书发售  你躲在这儿

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,200
<1-7,CASTLE>不  躲避是要用被子筑起堡垒
<1-7,CASTLE>No, hiding would be building a fortress out of my comforter

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,450
<1-7,CASTLE>再喝上许多苏格兰威士忌
<1-7,CASTLE>And then downing a fifth of scotch,

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,000
<1-7,CASTLE>不过显然这样有害健康
<1-7,CASTLE>But apparently that's considered unhealthy

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,820
<1-8,BECKETT>我原以为你不在意别人的想法
<1-8,BECKETT>I thought that you don't care what people think.

<5-35,NESBIT>Creason bought that old meat packing warehouse

222
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
<5-35,NESBIT>做肉类加工的旧车间
<5-35,NESBIT>On the lower east side.

223
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
<5-35,NESBIT>他想把那儿改成酒店
<5-35,NESBIT>He wanted to turn it into his next hip hot spot--

224
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,500
<5-35,NESBIT>300个房间  清酒吧  夜总会
<5-35,NESBIT>300 rooms, sake bar, nightclub.

225
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,190
<5-35,NESBIT>居民们可不想夜间的街头
<5-35,NESBIT>Neighbors didn't want a bunch of drunken

226
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,500
<5-35,NESBIT>总有一群问题人士乱晃
<5-35,NESBIT>B&t-ers running in the streets.

227
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,300
<5-35,NESBIT>所以霍恩担任委员时把它否决了
<5-35,NESBIT>So Horn killed it in committee.

228
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,980
<5-36,CASTLE>让克里森价值几百万的地产
<5-36,CASTLE>Leaving Creason with millions of dollars

229
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,230
<5-36,CASTLE>现在变得一文不值
<5-36,CASTLE>Of now worthless real estate.

230
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,160
<5-38,NESBIT>克里森和霍恩关系是不好
<5-38,NESBIT>Creason had a beef with Horn.

231
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,760
<5-38,NESBIT>但不代表他是凶手
<5-38,NESBIT>It doesn't mean he killed him.

232
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,280
<5-39,BECKETT>也难说他不是  告辞了
<5-39,BECKETT>Doesn't mean he didn't. Excuse me.

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,180
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>想知道我听说他死了以后
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>Want to know what I did

234
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,110
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>都做了些什么吗
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>When I found out that he was dead?

235
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,300
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>我点了一瓶冰凉香醇的香槟
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>I ordered myself a nice, cold bottle of Cris'

236
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,700
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>为世界的美好而举杯  怎么了
<5-40,CALVIN CREASON>And toasted the sweetness of the universe, okay?

237
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,200
<5-41,BECKETT>真是冷酷无情  克里森先生
<5-41,BECKETT>That's pretty callous, Mr. Creason.

238
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,700
<5-42,CREASON>听着  我为什么要在乎  凭什么
<5-42,CREASON>Listen, what do I care? What do I care?

239
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,640
<5-42,CREASON>这家伙是个蠢货
<5-42,CREASON>This guy was such a putz,

240
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,890
<5-42,CREASON>弄得好像多盖一个酒店
<5-42,CREASON>Acting like if another hotel going on.

241
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,500
<5-42,CREASON>世界末日就要来了
<5-42,CREASON>That was gonna be the end of the world.

242
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,840
<5-42,CREASON>你知道我这一项产业
<5-42,CREASON>Do you have any idea what one of my

243
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,300
<5-42,CREASON>对本地经济的作用吗
<5-42,CREASON>Properties do for local economy.

244
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,700
<5-42,CREASON>市政府应该赞助我  而不是阻止我
<5-42,CREASON>This city should be paying me, not stopping me.

245
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
<5-43,CASTLE>那么就是说你有杀人动机
<5-43,CASTLE>So I guess we could say you had motive.

246
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
<5-44,CREASON>这又是哪路神仙  你是警察吗
<5-44,CREASON>Who the hell is he? You a cop?

247
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,100
<5-45,CASTLE>-我们逮捕他  -卡塞尔
<5-45,CASTLE>- I say we arrest him. - Castle

248
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,400
<5-47,CREASON>凭什么  你没有证据
<5-47,CREASON>For what? Please! You got nothing here.

249
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
<5-47,CREASON>如果我真想把碍事的都干掉
<5-47,CREASON>If I was gonna go around killing everybody

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
<5-47,CREASON>那些死尸堆积起来
<5-47,CREASON>That ever got in my way, there would be bodies

251
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
<5-47,CREASON>会高过克莱斯勒大厦(纽约地标之一)
<5-47,CREASON>Stacked higher than the Chrysler Building.

252
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,400
<5-47,CREASON>我不需要用杀人来解决问题
<5-47,CREASON>I don't need to kill anyone to bury them.

253
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,700
<5-48,BECKETT>你昨晚在哪里
<5-48,BECKETT>Where were you last night?

254
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,300
<5-49,CREASON>-我在苏活俱乐部  -证人
<5-49,CREASON>- I was at my club in soho. - Anybody see you?

255
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,700
<5-51,CREASON>警官  我只要出门  大家都会看见
<5-51,CREASON>Detective, when I go out, everybody sees me.

256
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
<5-52,BECKETT>谢谢你  克里森先生
<5-52,BECKETT>Thank you very much, Mr. Creason.

257
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
<5-53,CREASON>当然
<5-53,CREASON>Sure.

258
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
<5-54,CASTLE>我想洗个澡
<5-54,CASTLE>I want to take a shower.

259
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
<5-55,BECKETT>-下一步怎么办  -查他的不在场证明
<5-55,BECKETT>- Where to next? - To check his alibi.

260
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,700
<5-56,CASTLE>事实上  没有这个必要
<5-56,CASTLE>Actually, that may not be necessary.

261
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
<5-57,BECKETT>为什么
<5-57,BECKETT>Why not?

262
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
<5-57,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干什么
<5-57,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

263
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
<5-58,CASTLE>答应我  别讨厌我
<5-58,CASTLE>Promise not to hate me.

264
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
<5-59,BECKETT>-我已经讨厌你了  -很好
<5-59,BECKETT>- I already hate you. - Fair enough.

265
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,000
<5-60,CASTLE>早上在现场  我拍了照片
<5-60,CASTLE>This morning with the body I took a couple of pictures.

266
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,100
<5-61,BECKETT>你在我的犯罪现场拍照
<5-61,BECKETT>You took photos of my crime scene?

267
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,000
<5-62,CASTLE>在你生气之前
<5-62,CASTLE>Before you get mad,

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,600
<5-62,CASTLE>我已经发了一些给一个朋友
<5-62,CASTLE>I e- mailed a couple of them to a friend of mine.

269
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,200
<5-63,BECKETT>你还把照片传给一个朋友
<5-63,BECKETT>You e- mailed them to a friend.

270
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,470
<5-64,CASTLE>准确地说  算不上是朋友
<5-64,CASTLE>Well, not exactly a friend.

271
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,400
<5-64,CASTLE>她是我的室内设计师
<5-64,CASTLE>She's my interior decorator.

272
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,700
<5-64,CASTLE>我们也在一起过
<5-64,CASTLE>But then we slept together,

273
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
<5-64,CASTLE>所以我也说不清她的身份了
<5-64,CASTLE>So I don't really know what she is now.

274
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,200
<5-65,BECKETT>你到底在想什么
<5-65,BECKETT>What the hell were you thinking?

275
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,600
<5-66,CASTLE>我知道  你们一起工作
<5-66,CASTLE>I know, right? You work together,

276
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,190
<5-66,CASTLE>你们认为这会很有意思
<5-66,CASTLE>You think it'll be fun,

277
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,500
<5-66,CASTLE>但是过后却觉得尴尬
<5-66,CASTLE>But then it always makes things weird.

278
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
<5-66,CASTLE>这是一则真实的警示故事
<5-66,CASTLE>It's a real cautionary tale.

279
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,900
<5-67,BECKETT>我说的是尸体照片的事
<5-67,BECKETT>I'm talking about the photographs of the body.

280
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,400
<5-68,CASTLE>什么  我没有发尸体的照片
<5-68,CASTLE>What? No! I didn't send her pictures of the body.

281
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,400
<5-68,CASTLE>我给她的是地毯的照片
<5-68,CASTLE>I sent her pictures of the rug.

282
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,500
<5-68,CASTLE>我想她可能能够
<5-68,CASTLE>I thought maybe she might be able

283
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,720
<5-68,CASTLE>告诉我地毯来自哪里
<5-68,CASTLE>To tell me where it came from,

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,500
<5-68,CASTLE>而且  她做到了
<5-68,CASTLE>And guess what. She did.

285
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
<5-68,CASTLE>就是这种地毯
<5-68,CASTLE>That's the rug.

286
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
<5-69,BECKETT>同样的地毯
<5-69,BECKETT>That's the same rug.

287
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,300
<5-69,BECKETT>别得意
<5-69,BECKETT>Don't gloat, okay?

288
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,600
<5-69,BECKETT>那副样子很讨厌
<5-69,BECKETT>'Cause it's really unattractive.

289
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
<5-70,CASTLE>现在可以逮捕他吗
<5-70,CASTLE>Now can we arrest him?

290
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,950
<6-1,CASTLE>我能感觉到你  兄弟
<6-1,CASTLE>I feel you, man.

291
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,050
<6-1,CASTLE>好的
<6-1,CASTLE>Yeah, okay.

292
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,150
<6-2,BECKETT>他十二点以后才到的俱乐部
<6-2,BECKETT>He didn't arrive at the club until after midnight.

293
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,350
<6-3,CASTLE>现在怎么办  等他的律师吗
<6-3,CASTLE>So what do we do now, wait for his lawyer to show up?

294
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,890
<6-4,BECKETT>我们要跟别的线索
<6-4,BECKETT>Actually, we follow other leads.

295
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,850
<6-4,BECKETT>这个我们叫做  工作
<6-4,BECKETT>It's something that we call "working."

296
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,850
<6-5,CASTLE>别的线索  很好
<6-5,CASTLE>Other leads? Good.

297
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,250
<6-5,CASTLE>既然我们都认为  他不是凶手
<6-5,CASTLE>Since we both know he didn't do it.

298
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:22,900
<6-5,CASTLE>克里森
<6-5,CASTLE>Creason?

299
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,050
<6-6,BECKETT>为什么说他不是凶手
<6-6,BECKETT>What makes you think he didn't do it?

300
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,950
<6-7,CASTLE>很明显嘛  所有的证据都指向他
<6-7,CASTLE>Isn't it obvious? All the evidence points to him.

301
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,850
<6-8,BECKETT>这反而证明他不是凶手
<6-8,BECKETT>And that somehow makes him not guilty?

302
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,250
<6-9,CASTLE>他就是红鲱鱼
<6-9,CASTLE>He's totally the red herring.

303
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,050
<6-10,BECKETT>红鲱鱼
<6-10,BECKETT>The red herring.

304
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,350
<6-11,CASTLE>看起来有罪  但却是清白的
<6-11,CASTLE>An innocent character who appears guilty.

305
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,850
<6-12,BECKETT>我知道红鲱鱼的意思  卡塞尔
<6-12,BECKETT>I know what a red herring is, Castle.

306
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,850
<6-12,BECKETT>这是文学里的一种行文策略
<6-12,BECKETT>It's a literary device used in literature.

307
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,490
<6-12,BECKETT>在现实中
<6-12,BECKETT>In real life,

308
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,350
<6-12,BECKETT>有嫌疑就不放过
<6-12,BECKETT>We don't dismiss a suspect

309
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,050
<6-12,BECKETT>何况他的嫌疑很大
<6-12,BECKETT>Just because he appears too guilty.

310
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,850
<6-12,BECKETT>而且我猜  你也想抓他
<6-12,BECKETT>Besides, I thought you wanted to arrest him.

311
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,530
<6-13,CASTLE>是的  因为他是工具
<6-13,CASTLE>Yeah, because he's a tool,

312
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,650
<6-13,CASTLE>不是因为他有罪
<6-13,CASTLE>Not because he's guilty.

313
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,650
<6-13,CASTLE>他是一个百万富翁
<6-13,CASTLE>The guy's a multimillionaire.

314
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,510
<6-13,CASTLE>不会蠢到用自己的地毯
<6-13,CASTLE>He's not gonna be dumb enough to

315
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,350
<6-13,CASTLE>去包尸体
<6-13,CASTLE>Wrap a dead body up in his own rug.

316
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,050
<6-14,BECKETT>这没关系
<6-14,BECKETT>It doesn't matter.

317
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,150
<6-14,BECKETT>这些地毯为克里森的酒店特别订制的
<6-14,BECKETT>Those rugs were custom designed for Creason's hotel,

318
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,950
<6-14,BECKETT>可见他与这事有关
<6-14,BECKETT>So we know he's connected.

319
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,150
<6-14,BECKETT>-埃斯波西托  -什么事
<6-14,BECKETT>- Hey, Esposito? - Yeah?

320
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,050
<6-16,BECKETT>查查哪个房间
<6-16,BECKETT>See what you can find on that rug--

321
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,300
<6-16,BECKETT>地毯不在了
<6-16,BECKETT>If one went missing,

322
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,450
<6-16,BECKETT>什么人进去过
<6-16,BECKETT>What room it's from and maybe who had access.

323
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,550
<6-17,ESPOSITO>好的
<6-17,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

324
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,550
<6-18,BECKETT>谢谢
<6-18,BECKETT>Thanks.

325
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,050
<6-19,ESPOSITO>开车上路
<6-19,ESPOSITO>Road trip.

326
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,750
<6-20,CASTLE>你很会指使身边的男人嘛
<6-20,CASTLE>You're very good at bossing men around.

327
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,550
<6-20,CASTLE>我已经发现了
<6-20,CASTLE>I've noticed.

328
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,350
<6-21,BECKETT>你是说一切都是巧合
<6-21,BECKETT>You're telling me that it's just a coincidence

329
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,100
<6-21,BECKETT>你开香槟庆祝
<6-21,BECKETT>That a man whose murder you celebrated

330
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,850
<6-21,BECKETT>他被谋杀
<6-21,BECKETT>By drinking champagne

331
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,250
<6-21,BECKETT>而且他的尸体裹着你们酒店的地毯
<6-21,BECKETT>Was found wrapped in a rug from your hotel?

332
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,850
<6-22,LAWYER>艾克秀姆酒店的所有房间都是相同的地毯
<6-22,LAWYER>There are identical rugs in every room of the axium.

333
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,790
<6-22,LAWYER>你不能要求我的当事人
<6-22,LAWYER>You can't expect my client to be responsible

334
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,750
<6-22,LAWYER>对这些地毯的下落负责
<6-22,LAWYER>For their whereabouts.

335
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,450
<6-23,BECKETT>我当然可以
<6-23,BECKETT>Sure I can,

336
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,250
<6-23,BECKETT>只要陪审团这么说
<6-23,BECKETT>Until a jury tells me otherwise.

337
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,550
<6-24,CREASON>你在浪费我的时间
<6-24,CREASON>You are wasting my time.

338

<6-25,BECKETT>They said that you made quite the entrance,

<6-25,BECKETT>两个超模  左拥右抱
<6-25,BECKETT>A supermodel on each arm.

345
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,750
<6-26,CREASON>并不是因为犯罪  不是吗
<6-26,CREASON>That's not a crime, is it?

346
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,150
<6-27,BECKETT>不是   不过是终生难忘
<6-27,BECKETT>No, but you know what it is? Memorable.

347
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,400
<6-27,BECKETT>凌晨一点之后
<6-27,BECKETT>Witnesses don't place you at the club

348
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,550
<6-27,BECKETT>你才出现俱乐部
<6-27,BECKETT>Until 1:00 in the morning,

<6-50,BECKETT>与霍恩有关的资料
<6-50,BECKETT>That you have some information on Horn,

<6-53,BECKETT>Opposition research?

398
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,450
<6-54,BOLLINGER>找了位有执照的私家侦探
<6-54,BOLLINGER>Conducted by a licensed private investigator.

399
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,920
<6-54,BOLLINGER>听着  我得强调
<6-54,BOLLINGER>Listen, I want to stress that

400
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,850
<6-54,BOLLINGER>这一切都通过律师的审查
<6-54,BOLLINGER>Everything we did was completely vetted by our lawyers.

401
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,250
<6-54,BOLLINGER>并没有违法
<6-54,BOLLINGER>None of it was illegal.

402
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,250
<6-54,BOLLINGER>我们只是试着找找
<6-54,BOLLINGER>We were just trying to determine

403
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,250
<6-54,BOLLINGER>议员先生是否有人生污点
<6-54,BOLLINGER>If the councilman had any significant vulnerabilities.

404
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,550
<6-55,CASTLE>你们找到了
<6-55,CASTLE>And you found some.

405
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,850
<6-56,BOLLINGER>是的
<6-56,BOLLINGER>Oh, yes.

406
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,650
<6-56,BOLLINGER>这就是官场  但我不是坏人
<6-56,BOLLINGER>Look, politics is politics, but I’m not a bad guy.

407
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,450
<6-56,BOLLINGER>我想  只要在民意调查中我还领先
<6-56,BOLLINGER>I figured as long as I was ahead in the polls,

408
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,050
<6-56,BOLLINGER>这些就没必要公开
<6-56,BOLLINGER>There was no reason to use it.

409
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,850
<6-57,BECKETT>这是那个议员霍恩
<6-57,BECKETT>That's councilman Horn?

410
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,950
<6-58,CASTLE>另一位可不是他妻子
<6-58,CASTLE>And that is not his wife.

411
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,620
<7-1,CASTLE>真佩服这位议员先生
<7-1,CASTLE>I gotta hand it to councilman Horny.

412
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,020
<7-1,CASTLE>这个年纪了  身体的灵活度真不可思议
<7-1,CASTLE>He is incredibly flexible for a guy his age.

413
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
<7-1,CASTLE>看这个  你做过吗
<7-1,CASTLE>Look at that. You ever do that?

414
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,720
<7-2,BECKETT>你能把这些拿一边儿去吗
<7-2,BECKETT>Would you put those away?

415
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,720
<7-3,CASTLE>我是说  他能做瑜伽或者普拉提
<7-3,CASTLE>I'm just saying, he's gotta do yoga or pilates or something.

416
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,170
<7-4,BECKETT>为什么被捉奸在床的
<7-4,BECKETT>Why is it always the family value guys that

417
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,120
<7-4,BECKETT>总是说重视家庭的人
<7-4,BECKETT>Get caught with their pants down?

418
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,320
<7-5,CASTLE>因为这个世界喜欢讽刺
<7-5,CASTLE>Because the universe loves irony,

419
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,520
<7-5,CASTLE>还有多数人都是伪君子
<7-5,CASTLE>And because most people are hypocrites.

420
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,820
<7-6,BECKETT>照片里的女孩儿在想什么呢
<7-6,BECKETT>And what was that girl thinking,

421
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,120
<7-6,BECKETT>他会为她抛妻弃子吗
<7-6,BECKETT>That he would leave his wife and kids for her?

422
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,620
<7-7,CASTLE>性别歧视
<7-7,CASTLE>That is so sexist.

423
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,320
<7-8,BECKETT>有吗
<7-8,BECKETT>How is that so sexist?

424
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,420
<7-9,CASTLE>你这么想  只是因为她是女人
<7-9,CASTLE>You assume that just because she's a woman

425
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,920
<7-9,CASTLE>所以她追求的是爱情
<7-9,CASTLE>That she was after a relationship.

426
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,820
<7-9,CASTLE>想过没  她也许只是需要性呢
<7-9,CASTLE>Did you ever think maybe she was in it for the sex?

427
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,720
<7-10,BECKETT>是的  我想过  但后来我看到了他
<7-10,BECKETT>Yes, I did. And then I saw him.

428
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,820
<7-11,CASTLE>就因为他被裹在地毯里  你就改变想法了
<7-11,CASTLE>What was it that turned you off, that he was wearing a rug?

429
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,920
<7-11,CASTLE>太快了吧
<7-11,CASTLE>Too soon?

430
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,420
<7-12,BECKETT>希望私家侦探那边能帮到忙
<7-12,BECKETT>I just hope that the P.I. can help us.

432
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,820
<7-13,ESPOSITO>地毯这条线断了
<7-13,ESPOSITO>Yo. So the rug is a dead end.

433
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,720
<7-13,ESPOSITO>后勤部门说

<8-26,CASTLE>So wonderfully hospitable to me,

521
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
<8-26,CASTLE>我也想聊表谢意
<8-26,CASTLE>I just want to return the favor.

522
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,120
<8-26,CASTLE>正好你们的咖啡难以下咽
<8-26,CASTLE>And because your coffee is basically crap,

523
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,620
<8-26,CASTLE>所以我送你们一台  意式浓缩咖啡机
<8-26,CASTLE>I got you... An espresso machine.

524
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,320
<8-26,CASTLE>很酷吧
<8-26,CASTLE>How cool is that?

525
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,020
<8-27,BECKETT>我的电话好像响了
<8-27,BECKETT>I think my phone's ringing.

526
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,820
<8-28,CASTLE>我不知道怎么安装
<8-28,CASTLE>I don't know how to put this together.

527
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,420
<8-28,CASTLE>这应该是送货负责的一部分吧
<8-28,CASTLE>That's part of the delivery, right?

528
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
<8-28,CASTLE>很好
<8-28,CASTLE>Excellent.

529
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,620
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>我不懂
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>I don't get it.

530
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,250
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>如果不是克里森干的
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>If Creason didn't do it,

531
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,120
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>那地毯是怎么来的
<8-29,ALEXIS CASTLE>Then how does the rug fit in?

532
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
<8-30,CASTLE>凶手可能听说了
<8-30,CASTLE>Killer probably heard about

533
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
<8-30,CASTLE>他们两个不和
<8-30,CASTLE>The feud between the two of them

534
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,620
<8-30,CASTLE>所以想转移嫌疑  但手法太蠢
<8-30,CASTLE>And tried to shift suspicion, which is stupid,

535
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,940
<8-30,CASTLE>因为如果没有地毯
<8-30,CASTLE>Because without the rug,

536
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,820
<8-30,CASTLE>这案子看上去不过是抢劫出了岔子
<8-30,CASTLE>It would've just looked like a mugging gone wrong.

537
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
<8-31,ALEXIS>所以他们弄巧成拙了
<8-31,ALEXIS>So by trying to look smart, they're actually being stupid.

538
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,920
<8-32,CASTLE>我想你说到了人类的生活
<8-32,CASTLE>I think you just described the human condition.

539
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,920
<8-33,ALEXIS>说到人类的生活
<8-33,ALEXIS>Speaking of the human condition,

540
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,620
<8-33,ALEXIS>贝克特探长怎么样了
<8-33,ALEXIS>How's it going with detective Beckett?

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
<8-34,CASTLE>什么意思
<8-34,CASTLE>What do you mean?

542
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,620
<8-35,ALEXIS>少来了  老爸  你以她做角色原型
<8-35,ALEXIS>Oh, come on, dad, you are basing a character off her.

543
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,320
<8-35,ALEXIS>你总是说  你必须爱着笔下的人物
<8-35,ALEXIS>And you always say you have to love your characters.

544
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,020
<8-36,CASTLE>当然  她是个人物
<8-36,CASTLE>Well, she is a character.

545
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
<8-36,CASTLE>但只是用来研究而已  没有其他
<8-36,CASTLE>But, uh, it's just research, nothing more.

546
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,520
<8-37,ALEXIS>是才怪
<8-37,ALEXIS>Yeah, I’m sure.

547
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,820
<8-38,MARTHA>终于明白为什么书卖不出去了
<8-38,MARTHA>Well... Found out why your books aren't selling.

548
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,920
<8-38,MARTHA>听听这个评论
<8-38,MARTHA>Listen to this review.

549
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,320
<8-38,MARTHA>他的作品变得落入俗套
<8-38,MARTHA>"His work has become so hackneyed, so cliché

550
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,520
<8-38,MARTHA>所以我们怀疑卡塞尔先生
<8-38,MARTHA>"That we wonder if Mr. Castle

551
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,620
<8-38,MARTHA>是否会有新创意
<8-38,MARTHA>Has anything new to say.

552
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,400
<8-38,MARTHA>似乎他的魔力  如果曾经有的话
<8-38,MARTHA>It appears the magic, if there ever was any,

553
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,120
<8-38,MARTHA>早就消失了
<8-38,MARTHA>Is long gone."

554
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,820
<8-38,MARTHA>亲爱的  太差劲了  可怜
<8-38,MARTHA>Oh, darling, I know it's awful. It's awful. I'm sorry.

555
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,320
<8-38,MARTHA>往你心上插刀啊
<8-38,MARTHA>Daggers to the heart.

556
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,620
<8-39,ALEXIS>时代周刊  雪城读者
<8-39,ALEXIS>"The Syracuse times reader"?

557
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,720
<8-40,MARTHA>别担心
<8-40,MARTHA>But don't you worry.

558
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,320
<8-40,MARTHA>我也要写篇我的感想
<8-40,MARTHA>I am going to write them a piece of my mind.

559
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,020
<8-40,MARTHA>谁管什么魔力消失了啊
<8-40,MARTHA>And who cares if they say the magic is gone?

560
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,580
<8-40,MARTHA>哈珀·李(著名女作家)就写了一本书
<8-40,MARTHA>Harper Lee only wrote one book.

561
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,520
<8-40,MARTHA>你可写了一打呢
<8-40,MARTHA>You've written dozens.

562
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,120
<8-40,MARTHA>当然了她的是文学  但我
<8-40,MARTHA>Of course hers was literature, but still, I...

563
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,820
<8-41,CASTLE>你觉得她花多久找到那个评论
<8-41,CASTLE>How long do you think it took her to find that review?

564
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,820
<8-42,ALEXIS>-可能整个下午  -对  对
<8-42,ALEXIS>- Probably all afternoon. - Yeah, yeah.

565
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,120
<8-44,ALEXIS>好了  知道她是疼你才这么做的吧
<8-44,ALEXIS>Oh, come on. You know she does it out of love, right?

566
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,820
<8-44,ALEXIS>她觉得她有责任让你觉得踏实
<8-44,ALEXIS>I mean, she thinks it's her job to keep you grounded.

567
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,420
<8-45,CASTLE>我确实觉得踏实了
<8-45,CASTLE>I certainly feel ground.

568
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,020
<8-45,CASTLE>你来处理  一号
<8-45,CASTLE>You have the bridge, number one.

569
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,120
<8-46,TIFFANY>-喂  -是理查德吗
<8-46,TIFFANY>- Hello. - Is this Richard?

570
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,620
<8-47,CASTLE>对  哪位
<8-47,CASTLE>Yes, it is. Who's this?

<8-48,TIFFANY>It's Tiffany. You called me for a date?

572

574
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,120
<8-49,CASTLE>只是好奇  你现在穿着什么
<8-49,CASTLE>Just out of curiosity, what are you wearing right now?

575
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,620
<8-51,LANIE>你吓死我了
<8-51,LANIE>Damn, girl, you scared me.

576
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,420
<8-52,BECKETT>蕾妮  你周围只有死尸而已
<8-52,BECKETT>Lanie, you're surrounded by corpses.

577
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,320
<8-53,LANIE>对  7点之后通常都见不到活人
<8-53,LANIE>Yeah, I don't expect the living after 7:00.

578
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,220
<8-54,BECKETT>有趣  我也是
<8-54,BECKETT>Funny, neither do I.

579
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,620
<8-55,LANIE>我是法医  你是为什么
<8-55,LANIE>I'm an M.E. What's your excuse?

580
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,520
<8-56,BECKETT>-别损我  -你活该
<8-56,BECKETT>- Oh, don't be mean. - You deserve it.

581
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,920
<8-57,LANIE>下了班和我一起喝酒
<8-57,LANIE>Getting a drink with me after work

582
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,320
<8-57,LANIE>没和大作家一起
<8-57,LANIE>Instead of getting your freak on with writer boy?

583
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,200
<8-58,BECKETT>他很烦人  自私又自大
<8-58,BECKETT>Well, he is annoying, self- centered, egotistical

584
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,420
<8-58,BECKETT>而且极为
<8-58,BECKETT>And completely--

585
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,720
<8-58,BECKETT>有趣
<8-58,BECKETT>Fun.

586
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,220
<8-59,LANIE>听我的  朋友  你需要点儿乐趣
<8-59,LANIE>And take it from me, girlfriend, you need some fun.

587
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,720
<8-59,LANIE>我说  他能差到哪儿去啊
<8-59,LANIE>I mean, how bad can he be?

589
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,620
<8-61,CASTLE>猜猜谁刚约了妓女
<8-61,CASTLE>Guess who's got a date with a prostitute.

590
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
<8-62,TIFFANY>理查德  我是蒂凡尼
<8-62,TIFFANY>Richard? I'm Tiffany.

591
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,220
<8-63,CASTLE>很高兴见到你  蒂凡尼  请
<8-63,CASTLE>It's a pleasure to meet you, tiffany. Please.

592
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
<8-64,TIFFANY>真绅士
<8-64,TIFFANY>Wow. A gentleman.

593
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
<8-65,CASTLE>我们快绝种了
<8-65,CASTLE>We're a dying breed.

594
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,820
<8-66,TIFFANY>那我很幸运能发现你
<8-66,TIFFANY>Well, then it's lucky I found you.

595
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
<8-67,CASTLE>其实是我们很幸运发现了你
<8-67,CASTLE>Actually, it's lucky we found you.

596
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,520
<8-68,BECKETT>凯特·贝克特探长
<8-68,BECKETT>Detective Kate Beckett.

597
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,620
<8-68,BECKETT>有几个问题要问你
<8-68,BECKETT>We need to ask you some questions

598
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,620
<8-68,BECKETT>是关于你和杰夫·霍恩议员的关系
<8-68,BECKETT>Regarding your relationship with councilman Jeff Horn.

599
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,820
<8-69,CASTLE>对不起
<8-69,CASTLE>Sorry.

600
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,320
<8-70,TIFFANY>他是我的常客之一
<8-70,TIFFANY>He was one of my regulars,

601
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,620
<8-70,TIFFANY>但我发誓  他的死和我没关系
<8-70,TIFFANY>But I swear I had nothing to do with his death.

602
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,420
<8-71,BECKETT>你多久和霍恩议员见一次面
<8-71,BECKETT>How often did you see councilman Horn?

603
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,520
<8-72,TIFFANY>一星期一次  有时两次
<8-72,TIFFANY>Once, maybe twice a week.

604
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,920
<8-72,TIFFANY>开始他只是想说说话
<8-72,TIFFANY>At first he just wanted to talk.

605
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,420
<8-73,BECKETT>是啊  他付你钱就是想说说话
<8-73,BECKETT>Right. He paid you just to talk.

606
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,020
<8-74,TIFFANY>警官  多数男人都是因为孤独才找我
<8-74,TIFFANY>Detective, most men come to me because they're lonely,

607
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,920
<8-74,TIFFANY>因为身边的人不再听他们说话了
<8-74,TIFFANY>Because the people in their lives don't listen anymore.

608
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,320
<8-74,TIFFANY>性只是他们的沟通方式
<8-74,TIFFANY>The sex is just a way for them to feel connected again.

609
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,920
<8-75,BECKETT>好  那你和霍恩议员最后一次
<8-75,BECKETT>Okay, when was the last time

610
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,720
<8-75,BECKETT>用这种方式沟通的
<8-75,BECKETT>That you and councilman Horn connected?

611
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,920
<8-76,TIFFANY>两周前他来找我  整个人歇斯底里
<8-76,TIFFANY>A couple of weeks ago. He came to me hysterical.

612
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,320
<8-76,TIFFANY>他说他不能再来找我了
<8-76,TIFFANY>He said that he couldn't see me anymore.

613
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,120
<8-77,CASTLE>怎么了  他太太发现了吗
<8-77,CASTLE>What happened? His wife found out?

614
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
<8-78,TIFFANY>不是  另有其人
<8-78,TIFFANY>No, someone else.

615
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,020
<8-78,TIFFANY>他说他被勒索了
<8-78,TIFFANY>He said that he was being blackmailed.

616
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,320
<8-78,TIFFANY>-有人有我们的照片  -谁
<8-78,TIFFANY>- Someone had photos of us. - Who?

617
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,120
<8-80,TIFFANY>他不知道  他开始以为是我
<8-80,TIFFANY>He didn't know. At first, he thought it was me.

618
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,820
<8-80,TIFFANY>他很沮丧  惶恐不安
<8-80,TIFFANY>He got upset, and then he panicked.

619
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
<8-80,TIFFANY>他以为我告诉了我的朋友
<8-80,TIFFANY>He thought that I had told my friends.

620
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,520
<8-81,BECKETT>你有没有呢
<8-81,BECKETT>And did you?

621
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,210
<8-82,TIFFANY>警官 也许你也会觉得惊讶
<8-82,TIFFANY>It may surprise you, detective,

622
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,420
<8-82,TIFFANY>但我也有自己的梦想
<8-82,TIFFANY>But I have dreams of my own.

623
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,320
<8-82,TIFFANY>我只是靠这赚钱
<8-82,TIFFANY>Look, this just pays the bills.

624
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,420
<8-82,TIFFANY>如果我们的关系被公之于众
<8-82,TIFFANY>If our relationship ever went public,

625
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,520
<8-82,TIFFANY>不是只有他的生活被毁了
<8-82,TIFFANY>He's not the only one that would be ruined.

626
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
<8-83,CASTLE>你说他  惶恐不安
<8-83,CASTLE>You said he panicked.

627
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,520
<8-84,TIFFANY>对  他不顾一切要找出是谁
<8-84,TIFFANY>Yeah, he was desperate to find out who was behind it.

628
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,120
<8-84,TIFFANY>他想做笔交易
<8-84,TIFFANY>He wanted to cut a deal.

629
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,170
<8-84,TIFFANY>他说他一直付钱的话
<8-84,TIFFANY>He said that he couldn't keep making payoffs

630
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,220
<8-84,TIFFANY>竞选团队肯定会发现的
<8-84,TIFFANY>Without the campaign finding out.

631
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,320
<8-84,TIFFANY>政治  妓女  勒索
<8-84,TIFFANY>Politics, escorts and blackmail?

632
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,620
<9-1,CASTLE>越来越有趣了
<9-1,CASTLE>This just keeps gettin' better.

633
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,320
<9-2,BECKETT>议员在找被谁勒索
<9-2,BECKETT>The councilman was looking for his blackmailer.

634
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
<9-2,BECKETT>要是他找到了会怎样
<9-2,BECKETT>What if he found him?

635
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,320
<9-3,CASTLE>他动了手  勒索的人还了手
<9-3,CASTLE>He gets violent. The blackmailer responds.

636
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,120
<9-4,BECKETT>然后为掩盖罪行就牵进克里森
<9-4,BECKETT>Then tries covering what he's done by implicating Creason.

637
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,620
<9-5,CASTLE>所以你只要找出勒索的人就行了
<9-5,CASTLE>So all you need to do is find your blackmailer.

638
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,020
<9-6,BOLLINGER>不可能  我把那些照片锁起来了
<9-6,BOLLINGER>That's impossible. I kept those photos under lock and key.

639
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,190
<9-7,BECKETT>并无恶意  贾森
<9-7,BECKETT>No offense, Jason,

640
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,720
<9-7,BECKETT>你的桌子不是诺克斯堡(美黄金储备金库)
<9-7,BECKETT>But your desk isn't exactly Fort Knox.

641
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,820
<9-7,BECKETT>如果有人知道
<9-7,BECKETT>If somebody knew about them,

642
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,120
<9-7,BECKETT>很容易就能拿到
<9-7,BECKETT>They wouldn't be difficult to get.

643
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,020
<9-8,BOLLINGER>你知道这个办公室
<9-8,BOLLINGER>Do you know how many people

644
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,820
<9-8,BOLLINGER>每天有多少人进出吗
<9-8,BOLLINGER>Are in and out of this office?

645
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,320
<9-9,BECKETT>不知道  你得给我名单
<9-9,BECKETT>No, but I would like a list.

646
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
<9-10,BOLLINGER>等等
<9-10,BOLLINGER>Now wait a minute.

<9-10,BOLLINGER>你想在选举还剩两周的时候
<9-10,BOLLINGER>You intend on opening up an investigation

648
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,620
<9-10,BOLLINGER>对我的竞选团队
<9-10,BOLLINGER>On my campaign

649
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,120
<9-10,BOLLINGER>进行调查吗
<9-10,BOLLINGER>With two weeks left in the election?

650
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,520
<9-10,BOLLINGER>你想干什么  让我输吗
<9-10,BOLLINGER>What are you trying to do, cost me the race?

651
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,420
<9-11,CASTLE>你担心什么  你没有对手了
<9-11,CASTLE>What are you worried about? You're running unopposed.

652
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
<9-11,CASTLE>不再是了
<9-11,CASTLE>Not anymore.

653
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,270
<9-12,BOLLINGER>劳里·霍恩宣布
<9-12,BOLLINGER>Laurie Horn announced that

654
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,320
<9-12,BOLLINGER>代丈夫参选
<9-12,BOLLINGER>She's running for her husband's seat.

655
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,620
<9-12,BOLLINGER>昨天我还领先8个百分点
<9-12,BOLLINGER>Yesterday I had an 8- point lead.

656
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,870
<9-12,BOLLINGER>民众同情心一上来
<9-12,BOLLINGER>With the sympathy bump,

657
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,120
<9-12,BOLLINGER>到今晚我们就会平手了
<9-12,BOLLINGER>By tonight we'll be tied.

658
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,020
<9-13,LAURIE HORN>我们不能让个人的悲剧
<9-13,LAURIE HORN>...that we cannot let our personal tragedy

659
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,520
<9-13,LAURIE HORN>阻碍了我的丈夫
<9-13,LAURIE HORN>Stand in the way of my husband's vision

<9-13,LAURIE HORN>对未来纽约的愿景
<9-13,LAURIE HORN>For the future of New York.

661
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,620
<9-14,BOLLINGER>讽刺的是  如果我现在公布那些照片
<9-14,BOLLINGER>Irony is, that if I release those photos now,

662
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
<9-14,BOLLINGER>人们会更加支持她
<9-14,BOLLINGER>The people will love her even more.

663
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,420
<10-1,CASTLE>至少有300人能拿到照片
<10-1,CASTLE>At least 300 people had access to those photos.

664
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,820
<10-1,CASTLE>你打算把他们全都审一遍吗
<10-1,CASTLE>Are you planning on questioning all of them?

665
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,420
<10-2,BECKETT>不  那只是用来做参考的
<10-2,BECKETT>No, they're just for reference.

666
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,120
<10-2,BECKETT>霍恩担心一直付钱的话
<10-2,BECKETT>Horn was worried he couldn't keep paying

667
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,620
<10-2,BECKETT>会被竞选团队发现
<10-2,BECKETT>Without the campaign finding out.

668
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,320
<10-3,CASTLE>那又怎样
<10-3,CASTLE>So?

669
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,820
<10-4,BECKETT>如果钱是来自竞选团队
<10-4,BECKETT>So if the money was coming from the campaign,

670
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,620
<10-4,BECKETT>那就一定会留下证据
<10-4,BECKETT>Then there is bound to be a trail.

671
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,520
<10-5,NESBIT>勒索
<10-5,NESBIT>Blackmail.

672
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,470
<10-6,BECKETT>我们相信他可能
<10-6,BECKETT>We believe he may have been

673
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,120
<10-6,BECKETT>用竞选经费来付的钱
<10-6,BECKETT>Making payoffs through the campaign.

674
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,720
<10-7,NESBIT>我认识杰夫很多年了
<10-7,NESBIT>I've known Jeff for years.

675
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,820
<10-7,NESBIT>他是个好人  爱家恋家
<10-7,NESBIT>He's a good man, a family man.

676
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,120
<10-8,CASTLE>你完全不知道吗
<10-8,CASTLE>You had no idea?

677
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,620
<10-9,NESBIT>不知道  如果这被公之于众
<10-9,NESBIT>None. If this gets out...

678
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,120
<10-10,BECKETT>内斯比特先生  如果他用竞选经费付钱
<10-10,BECKETT>Mr. Nesbit, if he used campaign funds to make payments,

679
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,800
<10-10,BECKETT>我们应该能够
<10-10,BECKETT>Then we should be able to

680
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,120
<10-10,BECKETT>追查出谁在勒索他
<10-10,BECKETT>Trace them back to the blackmailer,

681
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,420
<10-10,BECKETT>但我得看看你们的竞选账目
<10-10,BECKETT>But we need access to your campaign ledgers.

682
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,120
<10-11,NESBIT>当然  我给你拿光盘
<10-11,NESBIT>Of course. I'll-- I’ll get you a disc.

683
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,920
<10-11,NESBIT>但是  探长
<10-11,NESBIT>Look, detective...

684
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,120
<10-11,NESBIT>他的错误  我不是要原谅
<10-11,NESBIT>What he did was wrong. I'm-- I'm not... Excusing it.

685
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,320
<10-11,NESBIT>可一旦照片被公布
<10-11,NESBIT>But if you release those photos,

686
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,920
<10-11,NESBIT>那么他对这城市的贡献
<10-11,NESBIT>You'll be doing irreparable harm

687
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,020
<10-11,NESBIT>将不复存在
<10-11,NESBIT>To all the good he did in this city,

688
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,220
<10-11,NESBIT>更别说给他的家庭造成无法衡量的痛苦
<10-11,NESBIT>Not to mention causing immeasurable pain to his family.

689
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,620
<10-12,BECKETT>这些照片是谋杀调查的证物
<10-12,BECKETT>These photos are evidence in a murder investigation.

690
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,820
<10-12,BECKETT>不会将它们公之于众
<10-12,BECKETT>We have no intention of releasing them.

691
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,520
<10-13,NESBIT>感谢上帝
<10-13,NESBIT>Well, thank god for that.

692
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,120
<10-14,BECKETT>但是你要知道  不管怎样
<10-14,BECKETT>But you should be aware that, one way or another,

693
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
<10-14,BECKETT>这种东西总会大白天下的
<10-14,BECKETT>These sorts of things inevitably see the light of day.

694
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,020
<11-1,CASTLE>你不喜欢泡沫丰富的吗
<11-1,CASTLE>Oh, you got something against foamy richness?

695
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,920
<11-2,BECKETT>对  觉得很讨厌
<11-2,BECKETT>Yeah.  It annoys me.

696
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,720
<11-3,CASTLE>贝克特探长
<11-3,CASTLE>Detective Beckett.

697
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,620
<11-4,ESPOSITO>我们核查了霍恩的竞选支出
<11-4,ESPOSITO>We cross- referenced Horn's campaign payouts

698
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,820
<11-4,ESPOSITO>给博林杰公司的志愿者和雇员的薪水
<11-4,ESPOSITO>To the volunteers and employees at Bollinger's office.

699
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,420
<11-5,BECKETT>然后呢
<11-5,BECKETT>And?

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,120
<11-6,RYAN>直接从银行转到银行
<11-6,RYAN>Routed bank- to- bank

702
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,620
<11-6,RYAN>没有收款人  只有帐号
<11-6,RYAN>With no payee, just an account number.

703
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,620
<11-7,BECKETT>查过了这个帐户吗
<11-7,BECKETT>Were you able to track down the accounts?

704

<11-8,ESPOSITO>对  是布鲁斯·柯比
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah, it's, uh, Bruce Kirby.

705
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,620
<11-8,ESPOSITO>那个照相的私家侦探
<11-8,ESPOSITO>That P.I. That took the pictures?

706
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,820
<11-8,ESPOSITO>他就是那个勒索的人
<11-8,ESPOSITO>He is your blackmailer.

712
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,520
<11-12,CASTLE>和杀死霍恩议员的枪口径一样
<11-12,CASTLE>The same caliber that killed councilman Horn.

713

<11-33,MONTGOMERY>看能找到什么
<11-33,MONTGOMERY>Till we see what the search turns up.

750
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,300
<11-33,MONTGOMERY>同时要找出钱在哪里
<11-33,MONTGOMERY>In the meantime, follow the money.

751
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,500
<11-33,MONTGOMERY>如果这个蠢蛋说的是真的
<11-33,MONTGOMERY>If this bozo is telling the truth--

752
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,200
<11-34,BECKETT>那么霍恩被杀的时候身上有25万
<11-34,BECKETT>Then Horn had a quarter million when he was killed.

753
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
<11-35,ESPOSITO>对  钱在哪里
<11-35,ESPOSITO>Yeah, so where's the money?

754
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,900
<11-36,MONTGOMERY>薪水微薄的公务员
<11-36,MONTGOMERY>And where does an underpaid public servant

755
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,500
<11-36,MONTGOMERY>能从哪里弄到钱
<11-36,MONTGOMERY>Get it from in the first place?

756
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
<11-37,CASTLE>他会和其他政客一样
<11-37,CASTLE>Well, he'd go where all politicians go--

757
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
<11-37,CASTLE>去找喜欢他的人
<11-37,CASTLE>To people who like him,

758
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
<11-37,CASTLE>以前给过他钱的人
<11-37,CASTLE>People who gave him money before.

759
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
<11-38,KIRBY>我能回家了吗
<11-38,KIRBY>Can I go home now?

760
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,000
<11-39,NESBIT>杰夫·霍恩的离开是一个悲剧
<11-39,NESBIT>What happened to Jeff Horn was a tragedy...

761
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,100
<11-39,NESBIT>对他家人如此
<11-39,NESBIT>Not just for his family,

762
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,700
<11-39,NESBIT>对他服务过的市民更是如此
<11-39,NESBIT>But for all of us he served.

763
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
<11-39,NESBIT>尽管暴力夺去了他的生命
<11-39,NESBIT>And even though violence stole his life,

764
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,400
<11-39,NESBIT>他的夫人今天来和我们在一起
<11-39,NESBIT>His wife is here with us today,

765
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,870
<11-39,NESBIT>不让暴力夺去他的梦想
<11-39,NESBIT>Refusing to let violence steal his dream

766
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,000
<11-39,NESBIT>创造更好的纽约
<11-39,NESBIT>Of a better New York.

767
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,900
<11-39,NESBIT>女士们先生们  劳里·霍恩
<11-39,NESBIT>Ladies and gentlemen, Laurie Horn.

<11-40,LAURIE>谢谢  非常感谢
<11-40,LAURIE>Thank you. Thank you so much.

769
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,970
<11-40,LAURIE>我们都知道
<11-40,LAURIE>We all know

770
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,200
<11-40,LAURIE>今天本应是我丈夫在这里讲话
<11-40,LAURIE>It should be my husband speaking with you today.

771
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,500
<11-40,LAURIE>本应是他沉着的声音
<11-40,LAURIE>It should be his calming voice,

772
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,700
<11-40,LAURIE>不是大家现在听到我的声音
<11-40,LAURIE>Not mine, that you hear.

773
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,700
<11-41,NESBIT>这是市议员竞选  不是美国参议院竞选
<11-41,NESBIT>This is a city council race, not the U.S. Senate.

774
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,700
<11-41,NESBIT>我们靠的是成百上千的小额捐款
<11-41,NESBIT>We rely on thousands of small donations,

775
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,500
<11-41,NESBIT>不是几个大富翁
<11-41,NESBIT>Not a few big ones.

776
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,300
<11-42,CASTLE>他们的某些人财力雄厚
<11-42,CASTLE>Well, some of them must have deep pockets.

777
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,500
<11-43,NESBIT>捐助的额度受法律限制
<11-43,NESBIT>Well, the depth of those pockets is limited by the law.

778
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,000
<11-44,BECKETT>如果没有法律限制
<11-44,BECKETT>And if it wasn't limited by law,

779
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,950
<11-44,BECKETT>霍恩的支持者
<11-44,BECKETT>Did Horn have any supporters

780
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,600
<11-44,BECKETT>会不会多捐一些呢
<11-44,BECKETT>That would be willing to go the extra mile?

781
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,000
<11-45,NESBIT>探长  恕我直言
<11-45,NESBIT>Detective...with all due respect,

782
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,310
<11-45,NESBIT>我根本不可能
<11-45,NESBIT>There's no way in hell

783
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,400
<11-45,NESBIT>帮助你们
<11-45,NESBIT>I'm helping you start a witch hunt

784
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,540
<11-45,NESBIT>迫害我们的重要捐赠人
<11-45,NESBIT>Against our top supporters.

785
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
<11-45,NESBIT>你们想调查我们的竞选捐赠人
<11-45,NESBIT>Now you want to go through our campaign contributors?

786
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,400
<11-45,NESBIT>没问题  记录都是公开的
<11-45,NESBIT>Fine. That's a matter of public record.

787
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
<11-45,NESBIT>但是其它的事情  你们自己想办法吧
<11-45,NESBIT>But anything else, and you're on your own.

<11-50,CASTLE>- You wanna finish mine? - Well, that depends.

<11-51,ALEXIS>你能付我多少报酬
<11-51,ALEXIS>How much are you offering to pay me?

792
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,900
<11-52,CASTLE>得到我的真传了
<11-52,CASTLE>Oh, I taught you well.

<11-55,ALEXIS>在你眼珠上滴上蜂蜜
<11-55,ALEXIS>"Drip honey on your eyeballs

800
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,100
<11-55,ALEXIS>然后放上一大堆的火蚁
<11-55,ALEXIS>And let loose a hundred fire ants."

801
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,700
<11-55,ALEXIS>好  哪个更糟
<11-55,ALEXIS>Okay. What's worse--

803
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,900

<11-56,CASTLE>Or reading to a crowd...

<11-56,CASTLE>It sent me screaming out into the snow"?

806
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,300
<11-57,ALEXIS>你知道的  如果你真想为自己难过
<11-57,ALEXIS>You know, if you really want to feel sorry for yourself,

807
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,000
<11-57,ALEXIS>你应该读帐簿网的评论
<11-57,ALEXIS>You should read the review in "the Ledger."

808
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,980

<11-59,ALEXIS>Reminds us what good pulp fiction is all about".

812
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,300
<11-59,ALEXIS>令我们向往那惊奇而不完美的世界
<11-59,ALEXIS>"It makes us desire a world of startling imperfection

813
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,790

<11-60,CASTLE>看到它这么堕落  真让人伤心
<11-60,CASTLE>To see it fallen so far, it's sad, really.

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
<12-3,CASTLE>我在他第一次竞选的档案里发现了这个
<12-3,CASTLE>I found this in the archives from his first run for office.

832
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,400
<12-3,CASTLE>霍恩当时没有钱  但他妻子家境富裕
<12-3,CASTLE>See, Horn wasn't wealthy, but his wife came from money.

833
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,230
<12-3,CASTLE>她用自己家的信托基金
<12-3,CASTLE>She tapped into her family trust

835
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,720

<12-4,BECKETT>霍恩向妻子瞒住了外遇
<12-4,BECKETT>Horn was hiding his affair from his wife.

837
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
<12-5,CASTLE>是的  但是假如她已经知道这件事
<12-5,CASTLE>Yeah, but what if she knew about the affair?

838
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,900
<12-5,CASTLE>倘若他向她伸手要赎款呢
<12-5,CASTLE>What if he got the blackmail money from her?

839
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,150

<13-3,BECKETT>She knew.

<13-5,CASTLE>She doesn't say a word?

849
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,760
<13-6,LAURIE HORN>我确实没说
<13-6,LAURIE HORN>Of course I didn't say a word.

850
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,250
<13-6,LAURIE HORN>这些跟你们无关
<13-6,LAURIE HORN>It's none of your damn business.

851
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,550
<13-7,BECKETT>即便可能
<13-7,BECKETT>Despite the fact that it could have had

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,850
<13-8,LAURIE>我还有孩子  贝克特探长
<13-8,LAURIE>I have a family, detective Beckett.

854
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,450
<13-8,LAURIE>他们的父亲已经死了
<13-8,LAURIE>Their father is dead.

855
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,650
<13-8,LAURIE>还要把这个作为午夜脱口秀的笑料
<13-8,LAURIE>What use is dragging their names through the mud,

856
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,850
<13-8,LAURIE>让孩子们名誉扫地吗
<13-8,LAURIE>Providing fodder for late- night comedians?

857
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,150
<13-9,CASTLE>你是什么时候知道的
<13-9,CASTLE>When did you know?

858
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,950
<13-10,LAURIE>信托来电确认股票交易
<13-10,LAURIE>The trust called to confirm the stock sale.

859
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,750
<13-10,LAURIE>我那好丈夫在文件上模仿我的签名
<13-10,LAURIE>My wonderful husband forged my signature on the papers,

860
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,650
<13-10,LAURIE>以为我会笨的发现不了
<13-10,LAURIE>Thinking I would be too stupid to notice,

861
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,950
<13-10,LAURIE>当我与他对质的时候
<13-10,LAURIE>And when I confronted him,

862
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,250
<13-10,LAURIE>他说由于税务方面的原因需要这些钱
<13-10,LAURIE>He claimed he needed the money for tax reasons,

863
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,850
<13-10,LAURIE>一些我不懂的原因
<13-10,LAURIE>Reasons that I wouldn't understand.

864
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,050
<13-10,LAURIE>但是  我还是明白了
<13-10,LAURIE>But I understood, all right.

865
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,450
<13-10,LAURIE>我想要的一切
<13-10,LAURIE>Everything that I wanted,

866
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,850
<13-10,LAURIE>我想要的将来
<13-10,LAURIE>Everything that I wanted us to be,

867
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,950
<13-10,LAURIE>但他不能克制自己的欲望
<13-10,LAURIE>And he can't keep his fly zipped.

868
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,850
<13-11,BECKETT>那么你是决定怎么做的
<13-11,BECKETT>So what did you decide to do?

869
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,950
<13-12,LAURIE>在当众羞辱和被敲诈之间
<13-12,LAURIE>Well, between public humiliation and blackmail,

870
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,950
<13-12,LAURIE>我选择被敲诈
<13-12,LAURIE>I chose blackmail,

871
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,450
<13-12,LAURIE>我告诉他把事情解决了
<13-12,LAURIE>And I told him make it go away.

872
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,550
<13-13,BECKETT>你觉得那天晚上发生了什么
<13-13,BECKETT>So what do you think happened that night?

873
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,150
<13-14,LAURIE>我不知道
<13-14,LAURIE>I don't know.

874
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,750
<13-15,BECKETT>好吧  那么当晚他给你打电话时
<13-15,BECKETT>Okay. So that night, when he called,

875
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,450
<13-15,BECKETT>他到底都说了些什么
<13-15,BECKETT>What did he actually say?

876
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,250
<13-16,LAURIE>说他拿到了钱  准备去见那个家伙
<13-16,LAURIE>That he had the money, that he was going to meet the guy,

877
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,250
<13-16,LAURIE>这就是最后  他对我说的话
<13-16,LAURIE>And that was the last thing he said to me.

878
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,750
<13-16,LAURIE>老天知道后来发生了什么
<13-16,LAURIE>And god knows what happened after that.

879
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,150
<13-17,BECKETT>你确定钱在他手上
<13-17,BECKETT>And you're sure that he had the money?

880
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,250
<13-18,LAURIE>是的  怎么了
<13-18,LAURIE>Yes. Why?

881
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,750
<13-19,BECKETT>因为我们在你家发现了这笔钱
<13-19,BECKETT>Because we found it at your house.

882
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,650
<13-20,LAURIE>我家
<13-20,LAURIE>My house.

883
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,650
<13-21,CASTLE>今天早上拿到的搜查证
<13-21,CASTLE>The search warrant was served this morning.

884
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:51,650
<13-21,CASTLE>你的管家非常合作
<13-21,CASTLE>Your housekeeper was very cooperative.

885
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,250
<13-22,BECKETT>如果你丈夫被杀时身上带着钱
<13-22,BECKETT>If your husband had the money when he was killed,

886
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,850
<13-22,BECKETT>这笔钱怎么又跑回你家
<13-22,BECKETT>How did it get back to your house?

887
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,550
<13-22,BECKETT>你何止是生气  不是吗
<13-22,BECKETT>You were more than angry, weren’t you?

888
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,050
<13-22,BECKETT>简直是愤怒至极
<13-22,BECKETT>You were outraged.

889
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,150
<13-22,BECKETT>他不仅背叛你  还令你蒙羞
<13-22,BECKETT>He didn't just betray you, he humiliated you.

890
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,450
<13-22,BECKETT>而每个人都会知道
<13-22,BECKETT>And everyone was going to know,

891
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,550
<13-22,BECKETT>所以你就决定  做个了断
<13-22,BECKETT>And so you just decided to...make it go away.

892
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,050
<13-23,LAURIE>看到那些无法逃避新闻发布会的妻子们
<13-23,LAURIE>You see those wives in the inevitable press conference,

893
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,550
<13-23,LAURIE>面无表情的站在她们丈夫的身边
<13-23,LAURIE>Standing stone-Faced next to their men,

894
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,050
<13-23,LAURIE>你会想  她们怎么做到的
<13-23,LAURIE>And you think, how do they do that?

895
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,350
<13-23,LAURIE>她们怎么能就只站在那里
<13-23,LAURIE>How do they just stand there?

896
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,670
<13-23,LAURIE>眼睁睁看着
<13-23,LAURIE>How do they watch

897
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,790
<13-23,LAURIE>自己的世界
<13-23,LAURIE>As their whole world

898
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,650
<13-23,LAURIE>在聚光灯下  在羞耻中土崩瓦解
<13-23,LAURIE>Melts into a spotlight of shame?

899
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,150
<13-24,BECKETT>所以你杀了他
<13-24,BECKETT>And so you killed him.

900
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,650
<13-25,LAURIE>不  我当时在家
<13-25,LAURIE>N-No. N-No. I-I was home.

901
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,850
<13-26,BECKETT>你晚上11点给你丈夫打电话说了什么
<13-26,BECKETT>You called your husband at 11:00 P.M. What did you say?

902
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,350
<13-27,LAURIE>我当时和女儿们在一起
<13-27,LAURIE>I-I-I was with my daughters.

903
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:48,150
<13-28,BECKETT>无论你是否在现场
<13-28,BECKETT>Conspiracy to commit murder is the same as murder,

904
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,850
<13-28,BECKETT>同谋与谋杀犯的性质一样
<13-28,BECKETT>Whether you were there or not.

905
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,750
<13-28,BECKETT>准备坦白吗
<13-28,BECKETT>Are you ready to deal?

906
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,550
<13-29,LAURIE>我要做的只是打电话
<13-29,LAURIE>It was my job to make the call.

907
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,150
<13-29,LAURIE>我只要告诉他
<13-29,LAURIE>I was supposed to tell him

908
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,950
<13-29,LAURIE>敲诈的人改变了见面地点
<13-29,LAURIE>That the blackmailer changed the meet.

909
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,750
<13-29,LAURIE>然后告诉他怎么走
<13-29,LAURIE>I was supposed to tell him where to go--

910
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,750
<13-29,LAURIE>从那个没人能看到的地下通道下去
<13-29,LAURIE>Down by the underpass where no one would see.

911
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,250
<13-29,LAURIE>他已经安排好了一切
<13-29,LAURIE>He had it all arranged,

912
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,650
<13-29,LAURIE>甚至连裹尸毯都准备了
<13-29,LAURIE>Even that rug for his body.

913
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,950
<13-29,LAURIE>我要做的只是打一通电话
<13-29,LAURIE>All I had to do was make a call.

914
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,850
<13-29,LAURIE>他说他会处理现场
<13-29,LAURIE>He said he would make everything like it was.

915
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,050
<13-29,LAURIE>弄得像别人干的
<13-29,LAURIE>He said he would make it look like someone else did it.

916
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,750
<13-29,LAURIE>他还说没有人会知道
<13-29,LAURIE>He said no one would ever know.

917
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,450
<13-29,LAURIE>霍恩夫人
<13-29,LAURIE>Mrs. Horn...

918
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,950
<13-30,BECKETT>劳里  我要知道这人是谁
<13-30,BECKETT>Laurie, I need to know who.

919
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,250
<13-31,LAURIE>不应该是这样的
<13-31,LAURIE>It's not supposed to be like this.

920
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,550
<13-31,LAURIE>我们是朋友
<13-31,LAURIE>We were friends...

921
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,650
<13-32,BECKETT>我们要改变世界
<13-32,BECKETT>And we were gonna change the world.

922
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,910
<13-32,BECKETT>弗兰克·内斯比特
<13-32,BECKETT>Frank Nesbit,

923
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,750
<13-32,BECKETT>你因谋杀杰夫·霍恩被捕了
<13-32,BECKETT>You are under arrest for the murder of Jeff Horn.

924
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,450
<13-33,NESBIT>什么  荒谬
<13-33,NESBIT>What? That's ridiculous.

925
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,650
<13-34,BECKETT>霍恩夫人可不这么想  铐上他
<13-34,BECKETT>Mrs. Horn doesn't think so. Cuff him.

926
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:25,150
<13-35,ESPOSITO>内斯比特先生  你有权保持沉默  任何
<13-35,ESPOSITO>Mr. Nesbit, you have the right to remain silent. Any--

927
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,250
<13-36,RYAN>老兄  别跑了  竞选结束了
<13-36,RYAN>Stop running, bro. The campaign's over.

928
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,850
<13-37,CASTLE>哦  是啊
<13-37,CASTLE>Ooh. Yes.

929
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,150
<13-38,ESPOSITO>我还没有说完呢  内斯比特先生
<13-38,ESPOSITO>I wasn't quite finished back there, Mr. Nesbit.

930
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,070
<13-38,ESPOSITO>你有权保持沉默  你所说的话
<13-38,ESPOSITO>You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can

931
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,750
<13-38,ESPOSITO>将会成为呈堂证供
<13-38,ESPOSITO>And will be used against you in a court of law.

932
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,650
<14-1,BECKETT>在内斯比特的办公室找到凶器之后
<14-1,BECKETT>After we found the weapon in Nesbit's office,

933
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,050
<14-1,BECKETT>他交代了全过程
<14-1,BECKETT>He made a full confession.

934
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,750
<14-1,BECKETT>他让霍恩给她的丈夫打电话
<14-1,BECKETT>He got Horn to call her husband

935
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,350
<14-1,BECKETT>然后让他下了天桥
<14-1,BECKETT>And get him down to the overpass,

936
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,850
<14-1,BECKETT>剩下的事情都由他处理了
<14-1,BECKETT>And then he took care of the rest.

937
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,550
<14-2,CASTLE>政治是内斯比特的生命
<14-2,CASTLE>Politics was Nesbit's life.

938
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,750
<14-2,CASTLE>他说过  如果绯闻传出去
<14-2,CASTLE>He figured if the scandal broke,

939
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,850
<14-2,CASTLE>他的职业生涯就结束了
<14-2,CASTLE>His career would be over,

940
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,050
<14-2,CASTLE>他会被毁了
<14-2,CASTLE>And he'd be damaged goods.

941
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,550
<14-3,MONTGOMERY>可悲的是  他或许是对的
<14-3,MONTGOMERY>The sad thing is, he was probably right.

942
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,050
<14-3,MONTGOMERY>那么两个女孩怎么样了
<14-3,MONTGOMERY>So what happens to the girls?

943
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,350
<14-4,BECKETT>霍恩有个姐姐在纽约北部
<14-4,BECKETT>Horn had a sister upstate.

944
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,260
<14-4,BECKETT>她明天到
<14-4,BECKETT>She's coming down tomorrow

945
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,390
<14-4,BECKETT>把孩子们从社会服务中心接走
<14-4,BECKETT>To pick 'em up from social services.

946
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,150
<14-5,MONTGOMERY>好的  毯子呢
<14-5,MONTGOMERY>Good. And the rug?

947
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,150
<14-5,MONTGOMERY>障眼法
<14-5,MONTGOMERY>A red herring.

948
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,650
<14-6,CASTLE>内斯比特听说他们扔掉一大堆毯子
<14-6,CASTLE>Nesbit heard they were dumping a bunch of 'em,

949
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,450
<14-6,CASTLE>认为这样可以引开我们
<14-6,CASTLE>Figured it would keep us off his trail.

950
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,750
<14-7,MONTGOMERY>做的好  真不错
<14-7,MONTGOMERY>Nice work. Very impressive.

951
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,450
<14-7,MONTGOMERY>你也不错  贝克特
<14-7,MONTGOMERY>Oh, and, uh, you, too, Beckett.

952
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,250
<14-8,BECKETT>长官
<14-8,BECKETT>Sir?

953
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,650
<14-9,MONTGOMERY>逗你玩儿的  探长
<14-9,MONTGOMERY>Just yanking your chain, detective.

954
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,250
<14-9,MONTGOMERY>逗你玩儿呢
<14-9,MONTGOMERY>Just yanking your chain.

955
