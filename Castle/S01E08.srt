<1-2,MARTHA>不是吧  现在才
<1-2,MARTHA>Aw... Phooey. It's only... Ah!

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,470
<1-2,MARTHA>还不到午夜
<1-2,MARTHA>It's not even midnight.

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,210
<1-3,CASTLE>人家早上还要工作
<1-3,CASTLE>Some people have jobs to go to in the morning.

5

<1-4,MARTHA>Oh, my son, the working stiff.

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,810
<1-5,MARTHA>不跟
<1-5,MARTHA>Phooey. I fold.

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,220
<1-6,ESPOSITO>理查德女士  抱歉您很多次没跟了
<1-6,ESPOSITO>If you don't mind me saying, Mrs. R., you fold a lot.

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,230
<1-7,MARTHA>我只是不相信手气会转好
<1-7,MARTHA>I just don't believe in stringing along a bad hand.

9
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,550
<1-7,MARTHA>何必浪费时间
<1-7,MARTHA>Why waste time?

10
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,700
<1-8,CASTLE>事实上  我妈在行的不是德州扑克
<1-8,CASTLE>Actually, mother's game isn't really texas hold'em.

11
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,400
<1-8,CASTLE>而是脱衣扑克
<1-8,CASTLE>It's strip poker.

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,420
<1-8,CASTLE>能让乐子一刻不停  如果你明白我的意思
<1-8,CASTLE>Keeps things humming along, if you know what I mean.

13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,720
<1-9,MARTHA>坦白讲我更喜欢脱衣扑克
<1-9,MARTHA>Well, frankly, I prefer strip,

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,640
<1-9,MARTHA>因为即便你输了也是赢家
<1-9,MARTHA>because even when you lose, you win.

<1-16,ESPOSITO>-不跟了  -放弃
<1-16,ESPOSITO>- I'm out. - Slop.

<1-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔你呢  你已经为很久没跟了
<1-18,BECKETT>What about you, castle? You're already in for the blind.

21
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,270
<1-18,BECKETT>敢不敢玩点"刺激"的
<1-18,BECKETT>Not scared of a little...action, are you?

22
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,020
<1-19,CASTLE>"刺激"是我的中间名
<1-19,CASTLE>"Action" is my middle name.

23
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,100
<1-20,MARTHA>别担心  亲爱的  他在虚张声势
<1-20,MARTHA>Don't worry, sweetheart, he's bluffing

24
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,760
<1-20,MARTHA>每当他眼睛眨个不停的时候
<1-20,MARTHA>Whenever he blinks too much,

25
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,650
<1-20,MARTHA>就说明他的牌很臭
<1-20,MARTHA>It means he's got a lousy hand.

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,120
<1-21,CASTLE>妈
<1-21,CASTLE>Mother.

<1-25,MARTHA>- Uh-Oh. - What?

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,400
<1-26,BECKETT>他不眨眼了转而敲牌
<1-26,BECKETT>He's not blinking, but now he's tapping,

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,990
<1-27,MARTHA>说明他可能来了张好牌
<1-27,MARTHA>Which means he might have the nuts..

32
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,790
<1-28,CASTLE>那又如何
<1-28,CASTLE>What's the matter?

33
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,990
<1-28,CASTLE>你不会害怕玩点刺激的  对吧
<1-28,CASTLE>You're not afraid of a little action, are you?

34
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,600
<1-29,BECKETT>全部押上

<1-33,RYAN>这次写书的能耐帮不上了  卡塞尔
<1-33,RYAN>Can't write your way out of this one, huh, castle?

37
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,760
<1-34,ESPOSITO>干得好  贝克特
<1-34,ESPOSITO>Way to go, beckett.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,090
<1-35,BECKETT>或许有人该把中间名换做"衰人"了
<1-35,BECKETT>Maybe someone should change their middle name to "loser"

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,010
<1-36,MONTGOMERY>"衰人"
<1-36,MONTGOMERY>Loser.

40

<1-37,CASTLE>无话可说  今晚不走运
<1-37,CASTLE>What can I say. Guess it just wasn't my night.

42
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,810
<1-39,ESPOSITO>那眨眼睛的理论  没错你说得对
<1-39,ESPOSITO>It's the blinking thing, yeah, you're right.

44
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,710
<1-41,BECKETT>我们20分钟内到
<1-41,BECKETT>Yeah, we'll be there in 20.

<1-43,MARTHA>- I'll take care of this for you. - Thank you.

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,820
<1-45,MONTGOMERY>至少你们已经在市中心了
<1-45,MONTGOMERY>Well, at least you guys are already downtown.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,700
<1-46,MARTHA>但是已经过了午夜
<1-46,MARTHA>But it's after midnight.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
<1-49,CASTLE>有人说"谋杀"

<1-52,RYAN>圣诞树下躺着一具尸体
<1-52,RYAN>With a dead body under the tree.

<2-1,BECKETT>-是机油吗  -看上去挺像
<2-1,BECKETT>- It's motor oil, all right. - Looks like it,

57
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,820
<2-2,LANIE>不过我要从浴缸抽点样本  化验后才能确认
<2-2,LANIE>But I'll have to pump out the tub and run some tests to be sure.

58
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,340
<2-3,ESPOSITO>的确是机油  10W-40型号的
<2-3,ESPOSITO>It's motor oil, all right. 10W-40.

<2-4,ESPOSITO>衣橱里有装机油的空瓶
<2-4,ESPOSITO>Empties in the closet.

<2-5,RYAN>什么样的变态  会把一个女人溺死在机油里
<2-5,RYAN>What kind of a freak drowns a woman in motor oil?

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,330
<2-6,CASTLE>有人试图说明点什么
<2-6,CASTLE>Someone's trying to send a message.

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,280
<2-6,CASTLE>我已经和军装警察说过了
<2-6,CASTLE>I already told the uniforms.

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,880
<2-6,CASTLE>客人登记入住之后
<2-6,CASTLE>Once people check in,

64
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,600
<2-6,CASTLE>我可不管他们在里头做什么
<2-6,CASTLE>I don't wanna know what they do up there.

65
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,090
<2-6,CASTLE>她的钱包不见了  又没有身份证
<2-6,CASTLE>Her purse was missing, and she didn't have an I.D. on her.

66
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,560
<3-1,BECKETT>是否有可能用信用卡付房费
<3-1,BECKETT>Any chance she paid for the room with a credit card?

67
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,650
<3-1,BECKETT>我只能告诉你一点  死者是周五租的房
<3-1,BECKETT>All I can tell you is, whoever rented the room on friday

68
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,590
<3-1,BECKETT>用现金付了五天的房租
<3-1,BECKETT>Paid cash for a 5-day stay

69
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,190
<3-1,BECKETT>他们本应于今晚离开
<3-1,BECKETT>They were supposed to be out tonight.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,950
<3-1,BECKETT>因此到了午夜  我上去查房
<3-1,BECKETT>So at midnight, I went up to check

71
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,100
<3-1,BECKETT>看看房间是否空出来了
<3-1,BECKETT>If the place was empty

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,330
<3-1,BECKETT>没想到见她死在浴缸里
<3-1,BECKETT>and found her in the tub.

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,890
<3-1,BECKETT>打扫起来麻烦得很
<3-1,BECKETT>It's gonna be a bitch to clean it.

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,690
<4-1,CASTLE>那么如果有人来这边找她
<4-1,CASTLE>So if anybody was meeting her here...

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,100
<4-1,CASTLE>这里可不是来客人  会有电话通知的
<4-1,CASTLE>It's not like the guests arrive and I ring them up!

76
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,440
<5-1,CASTLE>-这可不是豪华旅馆  -明白了
<5-1,CASTLE>- This ain't the ritz. - Clearly.

77
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,110
<5-2,BECKETT>今晚呢  有没有举止怪异的人进出
<5-2,BECKETT>What about tonight? Anyone strange coming in or going out?

87
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,940
<7-4,BECKETT>然后给她来了一个机油浴

<8-1,ESPOSITO>说她进城工作却没有回家
<8-1,ESPOSITO>Said she went into the city for work and never came back.

<8-2,CASTLE>Poor guy. Unless he's the killer...

113
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,470
<8-2,CASTLE>试图在尸体发现前
<8-2,CASTLE>And he's covering his tracks by calling the police

114
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,700
<8-2,CASTLE>通过报案掩饰罪行
<8-2,CASTLE>Before the body's discovered.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,860
<8-3,BECKETT>在拘捕他之前先问问情况怎么样
<8-3,BECKETT>How about we question him before we convict him?

116
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,810
<8-3,BECKETT>有地址吗
<8-3,BECKETT>You got an address?

117

<8-4,BECKETT>Thanks.

118
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,890
<8-4,BECKETT>我不明白
<8-4,BECKETT>I don't un-understand.

119
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,450
<9-1,MICHAEL>你说在哪里发现她尸体的
<9-1,MICHAEL>Where did you say that she was found?

120
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,940
<9-2,BECKETT>市区的一个廉价旅馆
<9-2,BECKETT>At an S.R.O. in the city..

121
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,710
<9-2,BECKETT>就是一个单人间  类似供短期逗留的旅馆
<9-2,BECKETT>It's a single room occupancy. It's like a transient hotel.

122
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,010
<9-3,MICHAEL>她怎么会呆在那里
<9-3,MICHAEL>Why would she be in a place like that?

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
<9-4,CASTLE>你知道她在那里要和谁见面吗
<9-4,CASTLE>Can you think of anyone she might've been meeting?

124
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,310
<9-4,CASTLE>不知道
<9-4,CASTLE>No.

125
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,070
<9-5,MICHAEL>探长  我们的婚姻很幸福
<9-5,MICHAEL>My wife and I were happily married, detective.

126
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
<9-5,MICHAEL>我们坦诚相待
<9-5,MICHAEL>We had no secrets.

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,750
<9-6,BECKETT>你昨晚告诉警察你妻子
<9-6,BECKETT>You told police last night that your wife went into the city

128
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,780
<9-7,MICHAEL>-因工作而进城  -她做兼职
<9-7,MICHAEL>- For her job? - She was working part-time..

129
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,090
<9-7,MICHAEL>这几年我们财政状况不好
<9-7,MICHAEL>We'd had some financial setbacks the last few years.

130
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,810
<9-7,MICHAEL>我暂时失业  我们不得不卖掉公寓
<9-7,MICHAEL>I'd been laid off, and we had to give up the apartment.

131
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,590
<9-8,CASTLE>你妻子对于搬到郊区怎么看的
<9-8,CASTLE>How did your wife handle the move to the suburbs?

132
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,880
<9-9,MICHAEL>不太能接受
<9-9,MICHAEL>Not, uh, not too well.

133
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,380
<9-9,MICHAEL>艾莉森想念城市生活  因此几个月前
<9-9,MICHAEL>Allison missed the city, so a couple months ago,

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,730
<9-9,MICHAEL>她在曼哈顿的一家服装店
<9-9,MICHAEL>She got a job working three days a week

135
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,590
<9-9,MICHAEL>找到了一份一周三天的工作
<9-9,MICHAEL>At a clothing boutique in Manhattan...

136
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,520
<9-9,MICHAEL>就在72大街  里涵服装店
<9-9,MICHAEL>This little place on 72nd called Lehane's.

137
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,200
<9-10,MICHAEL>她说在那里工作
<9-10,MICHAEL>She said that being there...

138
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,290
<9-10,MICHAEL>抱歉
<9-10,MICHAEL>I'm sorry.

139
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,660
<9-10,MICHAEL>她说在那里工作
<9-10,MICHAEL>She said that being there...

140
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,270
<9-10,MICHAEL>勾起她很多对过去美好时光的回忆
<9-10,MICHAEL>Reminded her of the good old days.

141
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,170
<10-1,ESPOSITO>我试图把艾莉森·高德曼死前
<10-1,ESPOSITO>So I'm trying to put together a timeline

142
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,990
<10-1,ESPOSITO>几小时的行程整理出来
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Of Allison Goldman's last hours.

143
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,630
<10-1,ESPOSITO>首先我打电话给里涵服装店
<10-1,ESPOSITO>First call I make is to Lehane's,

144
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,810
<10-1,ESPOSITO>就是艾莉森工作的地方
<10-1,ESPOSITO>the store where she worked.

145
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,650
<10-1,ESPOSITO>我对店主说  早上好
<10-1,ESPOSITO>I say to the owner, "good morning, sir

146
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,020
<10-1,ESPOSITO>我想和你谈谈你的员工
<10-1,ESPOSITO>I'd like to talk to you about your employee

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,990
<10-2,BECKETT>-艾莉森·高德曼  -他说什么
<10-2,BECKETT>- Allison Goldman. - And?

148
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,110
<10-3,ESPOSITO>他说是谁
<10-3,ESPOSITO>And he says, "who?".

149
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,090
<10-4,CASTLE>艾莉森不在那里工作
<10-4,CASTLE>Allison didn't work there.

150
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,550
<10-5,ESPOSITO>昨天没有以前也没有
<10-5,ESPOSITO>Not yesterday, not ever..

151
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,050
<10-6,BECKETT>如果她一周进城三次
<10-6,BECKETT>Well, if she wasn't going into the city

152
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,240
<10-6,BECKETT>不是为了工作
<10-6,BECKETT>Three times a week for a job

153
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,460
<10-6,BECKETT>那她进城做什么
<10-6,BECKETT>Then what was she doing there?

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,700
<10-7,ESPOSITO>而且每个周五晚上又从哪里搞到的
<10-7,ESPOSITO>And how did she come home friday night

155
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,940
<10-7,ESPOSITO>四百美元贴补家用
<10-7,ESPOSITO>With 400 bucks in cash for the family kitty?

156
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,010
<10-8,RYAN>或许卡塞尔是对的  和性有关
<10-8,RYAN>Maybe Castle was right. Maybe this was about sex.

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,840
<10-9,ESPOSITO>她可是个好母亲
<10-9,ESPOSITO>The lady was a soccer mom.

158
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,480
<10-10,CASTLE>三点半路过我女儿的学校
<10-10,CASTLE>Come by my daughter's school about 3:30.

159
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,910
<10-10,CASTLE>那地方简直是天堂
<10-10,CASTLE>The place is like happy hour..

160
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,500
<10-11,BECKETT>或者她有个男朋友
<10-11,BECKETT>Maybe she had a boyfriend..

161
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,690
<10-12,CASTLE>在萨巴斯商店[专卖高级食品的超市]
<10-12,CASTLE>Yes, a boyfriend...

162
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,830
<10-12,CASTLE>排队认识了一位男朋友
<10-12,CASTLE>Someone she met in line at Zabar

163
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,170
<10-12,CASTLE>或者是一个下午在博物馆
<10-12,CASTLE>Or, uh, one afternoon at the museum

164
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,570
<10-12,CASTLE>她为躲雨  进入了博物馆
<10-12,CASTLE>When she, uh, ducked in to escape a rainstorm.

165
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,710
<10-14,CASTLE>也可能是她之前就在市区认识的人
<10-14,CASTLE>Maybe it was someone she already knew from the city,

166
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,970
<10-14,CASTLE>一个让她想起美好时光的人
<10-14,CASTLE>Someone who reminded her of when times were good,

167
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,030
<10-14,CASTLE>在被迫离开有水景的
<10-14,CASTLE>Before she had to give up  that cute apartment

168
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,290
<10-14,CASTLE>可爱公寓之前的时光
<10-14,CASTLE>With the partial river view.

169
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,940
<10-15,ESPOSITO>也许有人给她点小钱花
<10-15,ESPOSITO>Someone who was slipping her a little cash

170
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,080
<10-15,ESPOSITO>作为报偿她向其提供一些服务
<10-15,ESPOSITO>While he was slipping her something else.

171
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,340
<10-16,CASTLE>艾莉森·高德曼不像随便和人好上的人
<10-16,CASTLE>Yeah, Allison Goldman wouldn't have some cheap affair.

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
<10-16,CASTLE>这个人对可能对她有重大意义
<10-16,CASTLE>This person would've had to have meant something to her...

173
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,580
<10-16,CASTLE>一个关心她  倾听她的人
<10-16,CASTLE>Someone who cared for her, someone who listened to her.

174
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,370
<10-17,CASTLE>而现在他希望自己的付出要有回报
<10-17,CASTLE>Only now he wanted a little more return for his investment,

175
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,570
<10-17,CASTLE>做一些她不愿意做的事
<10-17,CASTLE>Something she wasn't willing to do.

176
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,090
<10-18,ESPOSITO>例如离开她丈夫
<10-18,ESPOSITO>Like leave her husband.

177
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,300
<10-19,RYAN>她不同意  于是他动粗
<10-19,RYAN>And when she wouldn't, then he got violent..

178
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,990
<10-20,ESPOSITO>没错
<10-20,ESPOSITO>Yep.

179
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,760
<10-21,BECKETT>这太荒谬了  我现在正寻找线索
<10-21,BECKETT>You know, I feel so stupid. Here I am looking for evidence,

180
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,990
<10-21,BECKETT>而你们却靠编故事了事
<10-21,BECKETT>And all I had to do was just make something up

181
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,140
<10-21,BECKETT>那么这个假想的男友杀手
<10-21,BECKETT>So this imaginary boyfriend killer..

182
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,440
<10-21,BECKETT>你们假想出他的地址没
<10-21,BECKETT>Do you think that he has an imaginary address?

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,550
<10-21,BECKETT>贝克特探长
<10-21,BECKETT>Detective Beckett?

184
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,980
<10-22,BECKETT>高德曼先生  什么事
<10-22,BECKETT>Mr. Goldman, what is it?

185
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,380
<11-1,MICHAEL>我的律师今早给社保办公室打电话
<11-1,MICHAEL>My lawyer called the social security office this morning

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,020
<11-1,MICHAEL>好让他们知道艾莉森去世了
<11-1,MICHAEL>To let them know that Allison had passed away.

187
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,420
<11-2,MICHAEL>两小时前他传真了这个给我
<11-2,MICHAEL>He faxed this to me two hours ago.

188
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,070
<11-3,BECKETT>死亡证明
<11-3,BECKETT>A death certificate?

189
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,800
<11-4,MICHAEL>艾莉森·波特的死亡证明
<11-4,MICHAEL>Yeah. For Allison Porter.

190
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,180
<11-4,MICHAEL>波特是我妻子娘家的姓
<11-4,MICHAEL>Now Porter was my wife's maiden name.

191
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,750
<11-5,BECKETT>不过上面说
<11-5,BECKETT>But it says here

192
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,460
<11-5,BECKETT>艾莉森·波特早在1963年就去世了
<11-5,BECKETT>that Allison Porter died in 1963.

193
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,610
<11-6,MICHAEL>这个波特死的时候才三个月
<11-6,MICHAEL>When she was 3 months old.

194
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,440
<11-6,MICHAEL>但这个已故孩子的社保号码
<11-6,MICHAEL>But this child's social security number

195
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,430
<11-6,MICHAEL>和我妻子的一模一样
<11-6,MICHAEL>Is the same as my wife's.

196
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,560
<11-6,MICHAEL>我妻子不是她自己说的那个人
<11-6,MICHAEL>My wife wasn't the womanshe said she was.

197
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,720
<11-6,MICHAEL>我们在一起的日子
<11-6,MICHAEL>Our whole life together...

198
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,560
<11-6,MICHAEL>是一个弥天大谎
<11-6,MICHAEL>Was a lie.

199
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,760
<12-1,ALEXIS>二十年了
<12-1,ALEXIS>So for 20 years,

200
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,880
<12-1,ALEXIS>这个女人都用一个假名生活
<12-1,ALEXIS>This woman was living under a false name?

201
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,440
<12-2,CASTLE>-这太疯狂了  -她丈夫无比震惊
<12-2,CASTLE>- That's crazy.. - Yeah, her husband was pretty shaken up.

202
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,300
<12-3,MARTHA>儿子这次信我  当一个女人嫁给男人
<12-3,MARTHA>Trust me on this one, kiddo. When a woman marries a man

203
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,080
<12-3,MARTHA>却20年不告诉他自己的身份
<12-3,MARTHA>And doesn't bother to tell him who she is for 20 years,

204
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,150
<12-3,MARTHA>说明她是个罪犯
<12-3,MARTHA>She's a crimina...

205
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,970
<12-3,MARTHA>玛塔·哈莉[一战间谍舞蹈家]  影夫人都是如此
<12-3,MARTHA>Mata Hari, shady lady.

206
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,880
<12-4,CASTLE>换句话说  她是个好演员
<12-4,CASTLE>In other words, a very good actress..

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,200
<12-5,MARTHA>说到这里  你似乎遗传了
<12-5,MARTHA>Speaking of which... You seem to have inherited

208
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,780
<12-5,MARTHA>-我的部分才华  -此话怎讲
<12-5,MARTHA>- A bit of my talent.. - Oh? How so?

209
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,950
<12-7,MARTHA>那场扑克牌  你放水让贝克特赢
<12-7,MARTHA>The poker game. You let Beckett win.

210
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,290
<12-8,CASTLE>我不晓得你乱说些什么
<12-8,CASTLE>I don't know what you're talking about.

211

315
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,260
<16-1,LEE>船上本应空无一人  没有载油
<16-1,LEE>You see, the ship was supposed to be empty of oil and people,

316
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,260
<16-1,LEE>但是船长山姆·派克中途回到船上
<16-1,LEE>But the captain, Sam Pike, had come back.

317
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,450
<16-1,LEE>在爆炸中瘫痪
<16-1,LEE>He was paralyzed in the explosion.

318
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,290
<16-2,BECKETT>你是如何查到欣西亚下落
<16-2,BECKETT>How did you track down Cynthia?

319
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,640
<16-3,LEE>不是我  是她找到我
<16-3,LEE>I didn't. She contacted me.

320
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,700
<16-3,LEE>欣西亚准备自首了
<16-3,LEE>Cynthia had decided to turn herself in,

321
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,950
<16-3,LEE>但投降之前
<16-3,LEE>But before she surrendered,

322
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,070
<16-3,LEE>希望将这一切公之于众
<16-3,LEE>She wanted to get her story out  to the public

323
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,600
<16-3,LEE>同时表达深深的忏悔
<16-3,LEE>And express her remorse.

324
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,490
<16-4,CASTLE>借此拉拢民众
<16-4,CASTLE>And get public opinion on her side.

325
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,530
<16-5,LEE>对潜在陪审团成员来说  这很奏效
<16-5,LEE>It's a great way to influence a potential jury pool.

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,810
<16-6,BECKETT>但她的确犯了错误对吗
<16-6,BECKETT>But she did it, right?

327
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,700
<16-6,BECKETT>她打算如何引导舆论
<16-6,BECKETT>So how was she planning on influencing them?

328
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,910
<16-6,BECKETT>欣西亚告诉我
<16-6,BECKETT>Cynthia told me that

329
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,910
<16-7,LEE>爆炸当晚  她曾想放弃
<16-7,LEE>On the night of the bombing, she had tried to back out.

330
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,160
<16-7,LEE>因为意识到船长还在上面
<16-7,LEE>When she realized that the captain was aboard,

331
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,160
<16-7,LEE>她提议取消活动
<16-7,LEE>She argued with Susan Mailer to call it off,

332
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,480
<16-7,LEE>但是苏珊拒绝了
<16-7,LEE>But Susan refused.

333
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,370
<16-7,LEE>争吵之后苏珊自行安装了炸弹
<16-7,LEE>Susan went to set the bomb herself

334
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,040
<16-7,LEE>却在爆炸中身亡  很讽刺吧
<16-7,LEE>And ironically, died in the explosion.

335
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,280
<16-7,LEE>欣西亚则销声匿迹
<16-7,LEE>She was vaporized.

336
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,470
<16-8,BECKETT>为什么她又出现在公众视线
<16-8,BECKETT>So why would she come out of hiding now?

337
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,950
<16-9,LEE>她需要钱
<16-9,LEE>Money. She need the cash.

338
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,400
<16-10,CASTLE>你付钱给她
<16-10,CASTLE>You were paying her?

339
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,610
<16-11,LEE>如果回忆录畅销  一周能有几百元
<16-11,LEE>A couple hundred a week. If the book had sold well...

340
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,490
<16-11,LEE>具体数字尚不方便透露
<16-11,LEE>I don't have to tell you how much money was at stake.

341
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,140
<16-12,BECKETT>你最后一次见到她是什么时候
<16-12,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw Cynthia?

342
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,570
<16-13,LEE>周二下午
<16-13,LEE>Tuesday afternoon.

343
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,460
<16-14,BECKETT>她有没有提过要去见谁
<16-14,BECKETT>Did she mention that she was going to see anyone else,

344
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,210
<16-14,BECKETT>或许是她从前生活中的人
<16-14,BECKETT>Maybe someone from her past?

345
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,100
<16-15,LEE>没有  她对此相当敏感
<16-15,LEE>No, no, Cynthia was really paranoid about

346
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,300
<16-15,LEE>不希望书籍出版之前被指认
<16-15,LEE>Being discovered before the book came out.

347
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,030
<16-15,LEE>也不许我联系她过去生活中的人
<16-15,LEE>She didn't want me to get in touch with anyone from her old life.

348
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,160
<16-16,CASTLE>不过你还是联系了
<16-16,CASTLE>But you did, anyway..

349
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,310
<16-16,CASTLE>要对得起罪案作家这个名号
<16-16,CASTLE>Any true crime writer worth their salt

350
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,110
<16-16,CASTLE>消息一定要可靠
<16-16,CASTLE>Is gonna check her story with other sources.

351
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,480
<16-17,LEE>没错  我是打了几通电话
<16-17,LEE>Okay, so I made a few calls.

352
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,500
<16-18,BECKETT>你联系的这些人中
<16-18,BECKETT>The sources that you were talking to,

353
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,130
<16-18,BECKETT>有没有想置她于死地的
<16-18,BECKETT>Did any of them want her dead?

354
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,670
<16-18,BECKETT>也许有  不过
<16-18,BECKETT>Maybe, but...

355
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,790
<16-19,LEE>别忘了  没人找得到她
<16-19,LEE>Remember, nobody knew how to find her.

356
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,620
<16-19,LEE>连我都不知道她住在哪里
<16-19,LEE>I mean,i didn't even know where she lived.

357
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,910
<16-20,BECKETT>我需要看看你的采访记录
<16-20,BECKETT>I'm gonna need to see your interview notes

358
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,240
<16-20,BECKETT>还有回忆录的原稿
<16-20,BECKETT>And your manuscript.

359
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,290
<16-21,LEE>需要材料尽管拿  不过作为回报
<16-21,LEE>You can have whatever you want, but in return

360
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,130
<16-21,LEE>我希望对调查过程全程跟踪
<16-21,LEE>I'd like to be kept in the loop as the investigation proceeds.

361
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,040
<16-22,BECKETT>为什么
<16-22,BECKETT>What for?

362
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,720
<16-23,LEE>-为了完成我的书  -你还要继续写完
<16-23,LEE>- My book. - You're gonna go through with it?

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,100
<16-24,CASTLE>欣西亚已经死了
<16-24,CASTLE>But Cynthia's dead.

364
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,900
<16-25,LEE>错  欣西亚被谋杀了
<16-25,LEE>Correction, Cynthia was murdered,

365
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,470
<16-25,LEE>因此她的回忆录
<16-25,LEE>Which means her memoir

366
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,190
<16-25,LEE>就变成罪案文学了
<16-25,LEE>Just became a true crime story,

367
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,720
<16-25,LEE>这正是我的强项
<16-25,LEE>Which is kind of my forte.

368
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,850
<16-25,LEE>你们可真是帮了大忙了
<16-25,LEE>You'd be doing me a huge favor.

369
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,460
<16-26,BECKETT>我也很想帮忙
<16-26,BECKETT>You know, I- I would love to.

370
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,980
<16-26,BECKETT>不过有一大群作家在我周围
<16-26,BECKETT>But I have a whole list of writers

371
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,650
<16-27,BECKETT>等着捡便宜
<16-27,BECKETT>Who are hanging around, looking for favors.

372
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,690
<16-27,BECKETT>所以  谢谢合作
<16-27,BECKETT>So thank you very much, though, for cooperating, and I'll...

373
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,290
<16-27,BECKETT>有消息我会私下再联系你
<16-27,BECKETT>Catch you on the dark side.

374
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,670
<16-28,LEE>这份兼职真不错
<16-28,LEE>It's a pretty sweet gig

375
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,490
<16-28,LEE>卡塞尔先生  很会利用外部条件
<16-28,LEE>You've scored for yourself, Mr. Castle.

376
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,200
<16-28,LEE>这就是成为畅销作家的秘密武器吧
<16-28,LEE>Is this your secret to writing best sellers?

377
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,690
<16-28,LEE>跟着漂亮女警官
<16-28,LEE>Follow the pretty cop lady around

378
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,130
<16-28,LEE>趁机得到详实丰富的资料
<16-28,LEE>And take copious notes?

379
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,460
<16-29,CASTLE>我的天份也起了一定作用
<16-29,CASTLE>I like to think talent played a small part.

380
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,930
<16-30,LEE>不过  能在警局和现场畅行无阻
<16-30,LEE>Still, this is the kind of all-access pass

381
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,560
<16-30,LEE>的确是作家梦寐以求的
<16-30,LEE>Most writers would kill for.

382
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,890
<16-31,CASTLE>直说你想干什么吧
<16-31,CASTLE>Let's get to the part where you tell me what you want.

383
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,770
<16-32,LEE>你给我打电话好了
<16-32,LEE>Well, maybe you can give me a call sometime...

384
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,670
<16-32,LEE>作家对作家
<16-32,LEE>One professional to another.

385
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,880
<16-32,LEE>是不是这件事也要上报女领导
<16-32,LEE>Or do you need to check with your boss lady?

386
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,550
<16-33,CASTLE>不如你把号码给我
<16-33,CASTLE>Why don't you give me your number,

387
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,330
<16-33,CASTLE>让我考虑一下  怎么样
<16-33,CASTLE>And I'll see what I can do?

388
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,740
<17-1,CASTLE>恐怖分子收集折价券过生活
<17-1,CASTLE>A domestic terrorist who clips coupons.

389
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,780
<17-1,CASTLE>多好的电影素材
<17-1,CASTLE>I just might buy the movie rights myself.

390
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,710
<17-2,BECKETT>显然爆炸装置
<17-2,BECKETT>Well, the bombing obviously wasn't

391
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,530
<17-2,BECKETT>不是很复杂
<17-2,BECKETT>A very sophisticated operation.

392
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,400
<17-3,BECKETT>苏珊·梅勒在爆炸中身亡
<17-3,BECKETT>Susan Mailer was killed in the blast,

393
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,710
<17-3,BECKETT>随后贾内德·斯万斯托被联调局逮捕
<17-3,BECKETT>And Jared Swanstrom was caught by the FBI

394
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,120
<17-3,BECKETT>被关押十五年
<17-3,BECKETT>And served 15 years.

395
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,560
<17-4,CASTLE>艾莉森·高德曼又名欣西亚·德恩
<17-4,CASTLE>Allison Goldman, a.k.a Cynthia Dern

396
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,720
<17-4,CASTLE>几乎逃亡二十年
<17-4,CASTLE>Managed to stay a fugitive for nearly two decades.

397
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,620
<17-5,BECKETT>最近刚刚暴露身份
<17-5,BECKETT>And then she poked her head out of hiding,

398
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,740
<17-5,BECKETT>几个月后  她就死了
<17-5,BECKETT>And a couple months later, she's dead.

399
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,400
<17-6,MONTGOMERY>谁会将一份怨恨埋藏二十年
<17-6,MONTGOMERY>Well, who would hold a grudge for 20 years?

400
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,050
<17-7,BECKETT>那些被她毁了下半辈子的人
<17-7,BECKETT>How about the people whose lives she's ruined?

401
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,620
<18-1,ELEANOR>你说她住在欧文顿
<18-1,ELEANOR>You say she was living in Irvington?

402
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,950
<18-3,ELEANOR>离这只有几英里
<18-3,ELEANOR>That's just a couple of miles away from here.

403
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,110
<18-4,BECKETT>死前几个月
<18-4,BECKETT>In the months leading up to her death,

404
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,430
<18-4,BECKETT>欣西亚曾和一名记者一起写作
<18-4,BECKETT>Cynthia was working with a journalist.

405
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,060
<18-5,ELEANOR>我们和李·瓦克斯聊过几次
<18-5,ELEANOR>We spoke with Lee Wax several times.

406
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,100
<18-5,ELEANOR>从没提到和欣西亚有关
<18-5,ELEANOR>She never told us Cynthia was involved.

407
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,330
<18-6,CAPTAIN PIKE>她应该告诉我们
<18-6,CAPTAIN PIKE>She should have.

408
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,120
<18-6,CAPTAIN PIKE>劳驾  失陪了
<18-6,CAPTAIN PIKE>Excuse me, will you? Excuse me, please.

409
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,920
<18-7,ELEANOR>这对他来说很艰难
<18-7,ELEANOR>This is hard for him.

410
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,880
<18-7,ELEANOR>对那件事他仍然很愤怒  我们全家都是
<18-7,ELEANOR>He's still angry about what happened. We all are.

411
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,010
<18-8,CASTLE>这是你儿子
<18-8,CASTLE>This your son?

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,120
<18-10,CASTLE>-和老爸一样做了海员  -安置费不够支付
<18-10,CASTLE>- He's a sailor, just like his dad. - The settlement wasn't enough to

<18-11,ELEANOR>山姆全部医疗费用
<18-11,ELEANOR>Cover all of Sam's medical costs.

415
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,230
<18-11,ELEANOR>亚当从十几岁开始
<18-11,ELEANOR>Adam's been working and helping out

<18-11,ELEANOR>就一直工作来贴补家用
<18-11,ELEANOR>Since he was a teenager.

<19-2,ADAM>是跟那个人有关吗
<19-2,ADAM>Is this about her?

419
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,100
<19-2,ADAM>欣西亚  艾莉森  或她随便编的名字
<19-2,ADAM>Cynthia or Allison or whatever she called herself?

420
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,520
<19-3,BECKETT>你知道她就住在附近吗
<19-3,BECKETT>Did you have any idea that she lived so close?

421
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,140
<19-4,ADAM>不知道  也不想知道
<19-4,ADAM>Didn't know, didn't care.

422
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,630
<19-5,BECKETT>你对这个差点杀了你父亲的
<19-5,BECKETT>You didn't care about the woman

423
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,130
<19-5,BECKETT>女人无动于衷
<19-5,BECKETT>Who almost killed your father?

424
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,880
<19-5,BECKETT>我认为这不可理喻
<19-5,BECKETT>I find that hard to believe.

425
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,500
<19-6,ADAM>我们全家苦等二十年
<19-6,ADAM>You know, my family waited 20 years

426
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,320
<19-6,ADAM>就为了等欣西亚·德恩被捕
<19-6,ADAM>For the cops to find Cynthia Dern

427
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,890
<19-6,ADAM>我父亲借此伸张一点正义
<19-6,ADAM>So my dad could get just a little bit of justice.

428
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
<19-6,ADAM>但二十年也太长了  一切都晚了
<19-6,ADAM>Well, it's too late for that now.

429
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,660
<19-6,ADAM>你们到底来做什么
<19-6,ADAM>So what do you want from us?

430
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,540
<19-7,BECKETT>只是以为你们想知道  欣西亚怎么死的
<19-7,BECKETT>Well, I thought you might want to know how Cynthia died.

431
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,260
<19-7,BECKETT>淹死在机油里
<19-7,BECKETT>She was drowned in motor oil.

432
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,880
<19-8,ADAM>机油
<19-8,ADAM>Motor oil?

433
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,560
<19-9,CASTLE>几乎可以确定  杀死她的人
<19-9,CASTLE>It's almost as if whoever did it

434
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,580
<19-9,CASTLE>曾和爆炸事件有直接关系
<19-9,CASTLE>had a personal connection to the bombing.

435
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,180
<19-10,BECKETT>亚当  你的车库里
<19-10,BECKETT>Adam, if I looked in your garage right now,

436
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,670
<19-10,BECKETT>是否有机油
<19-10,BECKETT>Would I find motor oil?

437
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,830
<19-11,ADAM>探长  我有一艘船和一辆车
<19-11,ADAM>I own a boat and a car, detective.

438
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,040
<19-12,BECKETT>上周二你在哪里
<19-12,BECKETT>And where were you last tuesday?

439
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,990
<19-13,ADAM>我每周二都在曼彻斯特一家烧烤店做酒保
<19-13,ADAM>I bartend at the Foxtail Grill on Manchester every tuesday.

440
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,370
<19-13,ADAM>还有什么要问的
<19-13,ADAM>Are we done?

441
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,930
<19-14,BECKETT>目前没有
<19-14,BECKETT>Yes, for now.

442
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,740
<19-14,BECKETT>谢谢
<19-14,BECKETT>Thank you.

443
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,020
<20-1,CASTLE>你知道吗
<20-1,CASTLE>You know what?

444
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,690
<20-1,CASTLE>我希望他的不在场证明成立
<20-1,CASTLE>I hope his alibi checks out.

445
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,780
<20-1,CASTLE>希望不是他做的
<20-1,CASTLE>I hope he didn't do it.

446
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
<20-2,BECKETT>那时估计你就会说
<20-2,BECKETT>And here I thought you would be saying

447
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,000
<20-2,BECKETT>要的确是他做的  该是多么精彩的故事啊
<20-2,BECKETT>What a great story it would make if Adam Pike did it..

448
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,080
<20-2,BECKETT>-子报父仇  -这个素材真的不错
<20-2,BECKETT>- A son taking revenge for his father. - It is a good story. It's a great story.

449
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,410
<20-3,CASTLE>从个人角度  我只想给这家人大团圆结局
<20-3,CASTLE>Personally, I would just write a happier ending for that family.

451
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,030
<20-4,ESPOSITO>这是89年油轮爆炸事件后  联调局的档案
<20-4,ESPOSITO>FBI files on the tanker bombing in '89

452
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,810
<20-4,ESPOSITO>-看完之后我发现  -请说
<20-4,ESPOSITO>- I've been going through them. - And?

453
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,320
<20-6,ESPOSITO>爆炸三天后贾内德·斯万斯托
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Three days after the bombing, they captured Jared Swanstrom

454
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,800
<20-6,ESPOSITO>在藏身的汽车旅馆中被捕
<20-6,ESPOSITO>At a motel where he'd been hiding out.

455
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,160
<20-6,ESPOSITO>警方收到消息  有人打来电话
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Feds had a tip line. Some helpful citizen calls

456
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,880
<20-6,ESPOSITO>说在汽车旅馆里看到斯万斯托
<20-6,ESPOSITO>And said they'd seen Swanstrom at the motel.

457
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,670
<20-6,ESPOSITO>联邦警探轻而易举抓住了他
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Feds go in, grab him up, easy peasy.

458
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,070
<20-7,BECKETT>这是正常流程
<20-7,BECKETT>It's pretty standard stuff.

459
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,130
<20-8,ESPOSITO>对  不过奇怪的是
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, until you get to the part where

460
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,310
<20-8,ESPOSITO>线人从未现身领取奖励
<20-8,ESPOSITO>The tipster never collects onthe reward.

461
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,530
<20-9,BECKETT>线人是谁
<20-9,BECKETT>And who was the tipster?

462
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,800
<20-10,ESPOSITO>没了  联调局也不知道
<20-10,ESPOSITO>That's just it. The FBI never knew

463
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:26,370
<20-10,ESPOSITO>-她是匿名打的电话  -她
<20-10,ESPOSITO>- 'cause she didn't leave a name. - She?

464
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,320
<20-12,ESPOSITO>记录显示  是一名年轻女性
<20-12,ESPOSITO>Records describe the voice as young and female.

465
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,930
<20-13,BECKETT>也许是欣西亚·德恩
<20-13,BECKETT>It could be Cynthia Dern.

466
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,700
<20-13,BECKETT>你认为她会向警方出卖同伙
<20-13,BECKETT>Do you think she would give up her friends to the cops?

467
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,090
<20-14,ESPOSITO>我的看法不重要
<20-14,ESPOSITO>Doesn't matter what I think.

468
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,260
<20-14,ESPOSITO>斯万斯托是否也有此想法
<20-14,ESPOSITO>It only matters what Swanstrom thought.

469
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,360
<20-14,ESPOSITO>入狱十五年
<20-14,ESPOSITO>The guy did 15 years in prison.

470
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,550
<20-15,CASTLE>有足够时间想清谁背叛了他
<20-15,CASTLE>That's a long time to think about who put you there.

471
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,730
<21-1,BECKETT>- Jared Swanstrom? - 怎么?
<21-1,BECKETT>- Jared swanstrom? - Yeah?

472
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,630
<21-3,BECKETT>纽约员警 我们想问你一些有关Cynthia Dern的问题
<21-3,BECKETT>NYPD. We'd like to ask you some questions about cynthia dern

473
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,530
<21-4,SWANSTROM>呃 我不知道有什么好说的
<21-4,SWANSTROM>Well, i'm not sure what i can tell you.

474
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,330
<21-4,SWANSTROM>我有20年没见到她了
<21-4,SWANSTROM>I haven't seen her in 20 years.

475
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,060
<21-5,CASTLE>可你知道她在写一本书 对吧?
<21-5,CASTLE>But you knew she was writing a book, right?

476
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,830
<21-5,CASTLE>- 你跟Lee Wax谈过  - 我是跟她谈了
<21-5,CASTLE>- You spoke to lee wax.  - I spoke with her.

477
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,260
<21-7,BECKETT>- 我...我托她问候Cynthia - 这么说 你并没有怀恨在心喽?
<21-7,BECKETT>- I- I told her to give cynthia my regards. - So you weren't bearing any old grudges?

478
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,980
<21-8,SWANSTROM>对欣西亚吗  为什么
<21-8,SWANSTROM>Against Cynthia? What for?

479
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
<21-9,CASTLE>把你弄到局子里
<21-9,CASTLE>For turning you in.

480
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,280
<21-9,CASTLE>你被捕的那晚是欣西亚打的电话
<21-9,CASTLE>It was Cynthia who called the cops the night you were arrested.

481
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,620
<21-10,SWANSTROM>就算这样  那她打电话也是为了自救
<21-10,SWANSTROM>Well, if that's true, she was just trying to save herself.

482
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,280
<21-10,SWANSTROM>爆炸之后  欣西亚想逃跑
<21-10,SWANSTROM>Right after the bombing, Cynthia wanted to run..

483
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,580
<21-10,SWANSTROM>跑到加拿大
<21-10,SWANSTROM>You know, try to make it to canada.

484
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,390
<21-10,SWANSTROM>但是我崩溃了
<21-10,SWANSTROM>But I, uh, I fell apart.

485
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,480
<21-11,CASTLE>为什么
<21-11,CASTLE>Why?

486
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,330
<21-12,SWANSTROM>内心谴责  是我造了炸弹
<21-12,SWANSTROM>Guilt. I'm the one who built the bomb.

487
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,630
<21-12,SWANSTROM>-但是我搞砸了  -怎么讲
<21-12,SWANSTROM>- I'm the one who messed it up. - Messed it up how?

488
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,970
<21-14,SWANSTROM>女孩子们本该有三分钟时间
<21-14,SWANSTROM>The girls were supposed to have three minutes

489
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,370
<21-14,SWANSTROM>趁爆炸前下船
<21-14,SWANSTROM>To get off that ship before it went off..

490
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,650
<21-14,SWANSTROM>三分钟
<21-14,SWANSTROM>Three minutes.

491
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,090
<21-14,SWANSTROM>那天晚上欣西亚回到车上说
<21-14,SWANSTROM>When Cynthia got back in the car that night,

492
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,800
<21-14,SWANSTROM>事情有点不对
<21-14,SWANSTROM>She said that something had gone wrong,

493
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,880
<21-14,SWANSTROM>炸弹提早  提早爆炸了
<21-14,SWANSTROM>That the bomb had.. had blown early.

494
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,950
<21-14,SWANSTROM>苏珊·梅勒是因为我才死的
<21-14,SWANSTROM>I'm the reason that Susan Mailer is dead.

495
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,620
<22-1,MARTHA>至少他们中有个人
<22-1,MARTHA>At least one of them took responsibility

496
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,190
<22-1,MARTHA>肯对那晚上的事情负责
<22-1,MARTHA>For what happened that night.

497
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,020
<22-2,CASTLE>没准他负的责任太多了
<22-2,CASTLE>Yeah. Maybe even a little too much responsibility.

498
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,570
<22-3,ALEXIS>你不相信贾内德·斯万斯托的话
<22-3,ALEXIS>You don't believe Jared Swanstrom's story?

499
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,330
<22-4,CASTLE>其实是这样
<22-4,CASTLE>Well, that's the thing

500
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,070
<22-4,CASTLE>不是他的话  而是欣西亚的话
<22-4,CASTLE>It's not his story. It's Cynthia's.

501
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,400
<22-5,MARTHA>你们想破坏了享用美酒的心情吗
<22-5,MARTHA>You wanna break it down for those of us who've already had a glass of wine?

502
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:25,220
<22-6,CASTLE>欣西亚告诉李·瓦克斯她曾与苏珊·梅勒争论
<22-6,CASTLE>Cynthia told Lee Wax that she and Susan Mailer had an argument as to

503
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,530
<22-6,CASTLE>是否明知船长在船上仍引爆炸弹
<22-6,CASTLE>whether or not to set off the bomb once they knew the captain was onboard.

504
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,980
<22-6,CASTLE>欣西亚不干了
<22-6,CASTLE>Cynthia backed out.

505
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,110
<22-6,CASTLE>苏珊于是独自引爆炸弹  于是
<22-6,CASTLE>Susan went on to set off the bomb by herself and...

506
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,360
<22-7,MARTHA>爆炸了
<22-7,MARTHA>... Boom.

507
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,680
<22-8,ALEXIS>但今天  贾内德·斯万斯托说欣西亚
<22-8,ALEXIS>But today, Jared Swanstrom said  that Cynthia

508
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,380
<22-8,ALEXIS>告诉他爆炸时机不对
<22-8,ALEXIS>told him there was something wrong with the timer.

509
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,410
<22-8,ALEXIS>她对争执一事只字不提
<22-8,ALEXIS>She never said anything about an argument.

510
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,570
<22-9,MARTHA>这可是一个明显的疑点
<22-9,MARTHA>Oh... Well, that is a rather glaring omission.

511
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,730
<22-10,CASTLE>当我创作时
<22-10,CASTLE>You know, when I'm writing,

512
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,350
<22-10,CASTLE>发现一切都和选择有关
<22-10,CASTLE>I find it's all about choices..

513
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,990
<22-10,CASTLE>哪些该讲述  哪些该省略
<22-10,CASTLE>What to put in, what to leave out,

514
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,920
<22-10,CASTLE>何时揭示真相  何时埋下伏笔
<22-10,CASTLE>When to reveal some information, when to hold something back.

515
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,790
<22-10,CASTLE>然而作为代笔人  你只知道
<22-10,CASTLE>But as someone else's ghostwriter, you only know

516
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
<22-10,CASTLE>别人想让你知道的
<22-10,CASTLE>What they want you to know.

517
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,270
<22-11,ALEXIS>所以李·瓦克斯  不是欣西亚的代笔人吗
<22-11,ALEXIS>But Lee Wax isn't Cynthia's ghostwriter anymore, right?

518
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,460
<22-11,ALEXIS>现如今她死了  这已不是回忆录
<22-11,ALEXIS>Now that she's dead, it's no longer a memoir.

519
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,130
<22-11,ALEXIS>而是一个真实发生的罪案
<22-11,ALEXIS>It's a true crime story.

520
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,280
<22-11,ALEXIS>听起来真实发生的事情
<22-11,ALEXIS>And it sounds like the true story

521
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,730
<22-11,ALEXIS>这一切比欣西亚的谎言更引人入胜
<22-11,ALEXIS>Is a whole lot juicier than Cynthia's lies.

522
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,540
<23-1,BECKETT>早上好
<23-1,BECKETT>Good morning. Oh. Hey.

523
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,330
<23-2,CASTLE>对不起  我刚刚
<23-2,CASTLE>Sorry. I've just...

524
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,610
<23-3,CASTLE>正在看李·瓦克斯的访谈笔记
<23-3,CASTLE>Been going over Lee Wax's interview notes.

525
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,830
<23-3,CASTLE>她跟贾内德·斯万斯托交谈时
<23-3,CASTLE>When she spoke to Jared Swanstrom,

526
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,760
<23-3,CASTLE>他所说的和他告诉我们的一样
<23-3,CASTLE>He told her the same thing he told us.

527
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,120
<23-3,CASTLE>欣西亚说炸弹爆炸早了
<23-3,CASTLE>Cynthia said the bomb blew early,

528
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
<23-3,CASTLE>但是她把没把这一段放在书里
<23-3,CASTLE>But she left that version out of her book.

529
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,720
<23-4,BECKETT>是因为这和欣西亚最近的讲述矛盾
<23-4,BECKETT>That's because it contradicted Cynthia's latest story,

530
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,140
<23-4,BECKETT>两个女孩争论之际发现
<23-4,BECKETT>That the girls argued when they discovered

531
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
<23-4,BECKETT>船长仍在船上
<23-4,BECKETT>That captain Pike was still onboard

532
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,990
<23-4,BECKETT>苏珊于是独自引爆了炸弹
<23-4,BECKETT>And that Susan set the bomb alone.

533
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,330
<23-5,CASTLE>根据出版商
<23-5,CASTLE>According to the publisher,

534
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,920
<23-5,CASTLE>李·瓦克斯所写须经欣西亚批准
<23-5,CASTLE>Cynthia has full approval over everything Lee Wax wrote.

535
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,230
<23-5,CASTLE>不听她的就得滚蛋
<23-5,CASTLE>It was her way or the highway.

536
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,670
<23-6,BECKETT>你跟出版商谈过吗
<23-6,BECKETT>You talked to the publisher?

537
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,480
<23-7,CASTLE>我正巧认识圈子里的人
<23-7,CASTLE>I am... somewhat known in those circles.

538
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,370
<23-7,CASTLE>不论怎样  他们不喜欢这样
<23-7,CASTLE>Anyway, they didn't like it.

539
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,530
<23-7,CASTLE>他们要的是一个真实的犯罪自白
<23-7,CASTLE>They were looking for a true crime tell-all,

540
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,060
<23-7,CASTLE>而他们拿到的则是
<23-7,CASTLE>And what they were getting was some

541
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,700
<23-7,CASTLE>毫无卖点的悔过书
<23-7,CASTLE>sanitized bunch of remorseful boohooing

542
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,880
<23-7,CASTLE>他们本准备终止出版
<23-7,CASTLE>They were getting ready to pull the plug.

543
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,530
<23-8,BECKETT>现在呢
<23-8,BECKETT>And now?

544
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,390
<23-9,CASTLE>现在欣西亚的凶杀满城风雨
<23-9,CASTLE>Well, now that Cynthia's murder  is all over the media,

545
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,170
<23-9,CASTLE>他们准备重新包装
<23-9,CASTLE>They're back onboard,

546
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,880
<23-9,CASTLE>只要从更有轰动效应的角度切入
<23-9,CASTLE>So long as the book takes a more sensationalized angle..

547
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,020
<23-9,CASTLE>"真实血案
<23-9,CASTLE>"Kaboom! The true story

548
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,190
<23-9,CASTLE>国内恐怖分子化身市郊主妇
<23-9,CASTLE>Of a domestic terrorist turned suburban housewife

549
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,660
<23-9,CASTLE>震惊全国"
<23-9,CASTLE>And the crime that shocked America."

550
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,010
<23-10,BECKETT>-抓人眼球  -谢谢
<23-10,BECKETT>- Catchy. - Thanks.

551
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,960
<23-12,BECKETT>既然欣西亚不在了
<23-12,BECKETT>So with Cynthia out of the way,

552
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,620
<23-12,BECKETT>李·瓦克斯有机会成为畅销作家
<23-12,BECKETT>Lee Wax is sitting on a potential best seller.

553
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,290
<23-13,CASTLE>杀人的原因可没有那么复杂
<23-13,CASTLE>People have killed for a lot less.

555
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,810
<23-14,BECKETT>好的  带他进来
<23-14,BECKETT>All right, bring him in.

556
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,910
<23-15,CASTLE>怎么了
<23-15,CASTLE>What?

557
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,870
<23-16,BECKETT>亚当·派克的不在场证明被推翻了
<23-16,BECKETT>Adam Pike's alibi fell apart.

558
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,320
<23-16,BECKETT>周二晚上他实际并未工作
<23-16,BECKETT>He was lying about being at work on tuesday night.

559
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,330
<24-1,ADAM>我没有杀她
<24-1,ADAM>I didn't kill her.

560
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,770
<24-1,ADAM>我甚至不知她在哪
<24-1,ADAM>I didn't even know where she was.

561
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,630
<24-2,BECKETT>如果你继续撒谎我可帮不了你
<24-2,BECKETT>We're not gonna get anywhere if you keep lying to me.

562
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,870
<24-2,BECKETT>我知道你去了威彻斯特
<24-2,BECKETT>I know you went to Westchester.

563
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,460
<24-2,BECKETT>我跟欣西亚的丈夫谈过  他记得
<24-2,BECKETT>I spoke to Cynthia's husband.  He remembers

564
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,600
<24-2,BECKETT>看到一个像你的人  在案发几周前
<24-2,BECKETT>Seeing a guy just like you outside their house,

565
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,510
<24-2,BECKETT>在他家屋外出没
<24-2,BECKETT>A couple weeks before she was murdered.

566
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,380
<24-2,BECKETT>别逼我把你列为嫌犯
<24-2,BECKETT>Don't make me put you in the lineup.

567
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,290
<24-3,ADAM>我只是
<24-3,ADAM>I just...

568
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,220
<24-3,ADAM>想跟她谈谈
<24-3,ADAM>Wanted to talk to her.

569
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,410
<24-4,BECKETT>-你怎么找到她的  -那个作家
<24-4,BECKETT>- How'd you find her? - That writer.

570
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,340
<24-5,ADAM>她谈起我爸的事  那种语气
<24-5,ADAM>The way she kept talking about what happened to my dad..

571
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,540
<24-5,ADAM>那些事  只有在场的人才知道
<24-5,ADAM>She knew things that only someone on that ship could know.

572
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,790
<24-5,ADAM>所以我
<24-5,ADAM>So I...

573
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,240
<24-5,ADAM>跟踪她
<24-5,ADAM>Started following her around.

574
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,330
<24-5,ADAM>最终  我跟着找到了欣西亚·德恩
<24-5,ADAM>Eventually, she led me to Cynthia Dern.

575
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,190
<24-6,BECKETT>你为什么不报警
<24-6,BECKETT>And why didn't you call the police?

576
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,230
<24-7,ADAM>因为我想直视她的眼睛
<24-7,ADAM>Because I wanted to look her in the eye.

577
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,440
<24-7,ADAM>我想告诉她  她做的都是徒劳的
<24-7,ADAM>I wanted to tell her none of it mattered.

578
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,560
<24-7,ADAM>休想用她沾满鲜血的钱换来宽恕
<24-7,ADAM>Her blood money wouldn't buy our forgiveness.

579
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,890
<24-8,CASTLE>什么钱
<24-8,CASTLE>What money?

580
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,760
<24-9,BECKETT>什么叫沾满鲜血的钱
<24-9,BECKETT>What do you mean by "blood money"?

581
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,510
<24-10,ADAM>在我发现欣西亚的住处
<24-10,ADAM>After I found out where Cynthia lived

582
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:34,900
<24-10,ADAM>我告诉了我妈妈
<24-10,ADAM>I went and told my mom.

583
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,360
<24-10,ADAM>我不知道是否该打给联调局还是谁
<24-10,ADAM>I didn't know if we should call the feds or what.

584
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,340
<24-10,ADAM>她开始啜泣
<24-10,ADAM>She started crying.

585
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,660
<24-10,ADAM>她告诉我从爆炸那天起
<24-10,ADAM>She told me we'd been getting money

586
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,500
<24-10,ADAM>每个月会收到一笔钱
<24-10,ADAM>every month since the bombing different amounts..

587
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,530
<24-10,ADAM>时多时少
<24-10,ADAM>Sometimes more, sometimes less..

588
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,940
<24-10,ADAM>但是月月未落
<24-10,ADAM>But every month.

589
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,690
<24-11,BECKETT>她认为钱是欣西亚·德恩寄来的
<24-11,BECKETT>And she thought that the money was coming from Cynthia Dern?

590
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,640
<24-12,ADAM>第一封信  有一张条子
<24-12,ADAM>The first envelope, there was a note.

591
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,620
<24-12,ADAM>"请原谅我"
<24-12,ADAM>"Please forgive me."

592
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,490
<24-12,ADAM>苏珊·梅勒死了
<24-12,ADAM>Susan Mailer was dead.

593
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,780
<24-12,ADAM>斯万斯托在蹲监狱
<24-12,ADAM>Swanstrom was in prison.

594
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,440
<24-12,ADAM>不可能会是别人
<24-12,ADAM>There wasn't anybody else.

595
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,770
<24-13,BECKETT>你知道  凭你所言
<24-13,BECKETT>You know, with this kind of evidence,

596
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,840
<24-13,BECKETT>我们本可在好几年前逮捕欣西亚
<24-13,BECKETT>Cynthia could've been caught years ago.

597
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,630
<24-14,ADAM>妈妈说  没有那笔钱
<24-14,ADAM>Mom said without that money,

598
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,690
<24-14,ADAM>我们娘俩撑不下来
<24-14,ADAM>We wouldn't have made it,

599
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,420
<24-14,ADAM>她自认为只要欣西亚逍遥法外
<24-14,ADAM>And she figured, as long as Cynthia was free,

600
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,730
<24-14,ADAM>钱就会一直寄来
<24-14,ADAM>The money would keep coming.

601
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,500
<24-15,BECKETT>那为什么要骗我们上周二你在工作
<24-15,BECKETT>So why did you lie to me about where you were last tuesday?

602
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,180
<24-16,ADAM>因为我在犯罪现场
<24-16,ADAM>Because I was there.

603
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,140
<24-16,ADAM>我在酒店  我跟踪她来着
<24-16,ADAM>At the hotel. I followed her.

604
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,190
<24-3,ADAM>我本要跟她谈谈
<24-3,ADAM>Look, I was just gonna talk to her.

605
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,940
<24-15,BECKETT>整整一个小时  我在楼梯间踱步
<24-15,BECKETT>I spent an hour walking up and down that hallway,

606
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,440
<24-16,ADAM>想着能鼓起勇气敲门
<24-16,ADAM>Trying to get up the courage to go and knock on that door.

607
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,260
<24-16,ADAM>我本要这么做
<24-16,ADAM>You know, i- I was gonna do it.

608
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,870
<24-16,ADAM>但是有别人下了电梯  敲了她的门
<24-16,ADAM>But then someone got off the elevator and knocked on her door instead.

609
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,500
<24-17,BECKETT>你看到了杀她的人吗
<24-17,BECKETT>You saw her killer?

610
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,620
<24-18,ADAM>没看清  但是我听到了他们的对话
<24-18,ADAM>I didn't get a good look, but I did hear them talking.

611
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,180
<24-18,ADAM>-我能告诉你一件事  -什么
<24-18,ADAM>- And I can tell you one thing. - What?

612
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,970
<24-20,ADAM>是一个女人
<24-20,ADAM>It was a woman.

<25-2,BECKETT>I have an eyewitness who can place you at the S.R.O.

621
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,310
<25-2,BECKETT>欣西亚尸体被发现的地方
<25-2,BECKETT>Where Cynthia's body was found.

622
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,760
<25-3,CASTLE>你有动机  方式  和机会
<25-3,CASTLE>You had motive, means andopportunity.

<25-4,LEE>Please. Only a novelist

624
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,830
<25-4,LEE>能编出这么离奇的故事
<25-4,LEE>Could come up with a twist this absurd.

625
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,840
<25-5,CASTLE>可不如为抢救自己的小说
<25-5,CASTLE>Not as absurd as killing a woman to salvage your story.

626
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,250
<25-5,CASTLE>把她溺死在机油里
<25-5,CASTLE>Drowning her in motor oil

627
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,860
<25-5,CASTLE>而更加离奇吧
<25-5,CASTLE>Gave you just the ending you need.

628
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,720
<25-6,LEE>我是个真实罪案记录作家
<25-6,LEE>I'm a true crime writer

629
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,030
<25-6,LEE>并没什么编故事的天分
<25-6,LEE>So I don't have your talent for fiction.

630
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,840
<25-7,BECKETT>我们知道出版商想撤回出版合同
<25-7,BECKETT>We know your publisher wanted to dump your contract.

631
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,560
<25-8,LEE>那是因为我告诉他们
<25-8,LEE>Because I told them

632
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,510
<25-8,LEE>我认为欣西亚撒谎
<25-8,LEE>that I thought Cynthia was lying.

633
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,780
<25-9,BECKETT>你不认为她的悔过是发自内心的吗
<25-9,BECKETT>So you didn't believe her remorse was genuine?

634
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,270
<25-10,LEE>当欣西亚哭时  全是为了自己
<25-10,LEE>When Cynthia cried, it was for herself.

635
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,420
<25-10,LEE>用悔过的眼泪换点钱
<25-10,LEE>She wanted to cash in

636
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
<25-10,LEE>再帮自己离开监狱  仅此而已
<25-10,LEE>And keep herself out of jail. That's it.

637
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,640
<25-11,BECKETT>她一定觉得自己该为那天发生的事负责吧
<25-11,BECKETT>Well, she must've felt some responsibility for what happened.

638
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,480
<25-11,BECKETT>毕竟  她每年都给派克一家寄钱
<25-11,BECKETT>After all, she sent the Pikes money year after year..

639
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,580
<25-12,LEE>什么钱
<25-12,LEE>What money?

640
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,770
<25-13,CASTLE>从爆炸发生后的每个月
<25-13,CASTLE>Every month since the bombing,

641
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,570
<25-13,CASTLE>派克一家一直收到钱
<25-13,CASTLE>The Pikes have been receiving money

642
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,210
<25-13,CASTLE>来自欣西亚·德恩的一点好意
<25-13,CASTLE>Courtesy of Cynthia Dern.

643
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,070
<25-13,CASTLE>你的笔记里可无丝毫涉及
<25-13,CASTLE>Only, there's nothing about that in your notes.

644
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,160
<25-14,LEE>因为她从没提过  你们确定吗
<25-14,LEE>Because she never told me.  Are you sure?

645
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,080
<25-15,BECKETT>确定
<25-15,BECKETT>We're sure.

646
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,820
<25-16,LEE>欣西亚被杀的那个周二
<25-16,LEE>Look, the tuesday that Cynthia was killed,

647
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,560
<25-16,LEE>我和我的出版商正在吃饭
<25-16,LEE>I was out to dinner with my publisher

648
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,860
<25-16,LEE>一直到午夜
<25-16,LEE>Until after midnight,

649
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,330
<25-16,LEE>所以我没法杀她
<25-16,LEE>So I couldn't have killed her.

650
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,210
<26-1,CASTLE>如果我要决定写回忆录
<26-1,CASTLE>Remind me, if I ever decide to write a memoir,

651
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,580
<26-1,CASTLE>千万阻止我
<26-1,CASTLE>To never write a memoir.

652
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,900
<26-2,BECKETT>好
<26-2,BECKETT>Okay.

653
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,530
<26-3,BECKETT>为什么呢
<26-3,BECKETT>Why not?

654
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,770
<26-4,CASTLE>因为回忆录是真实的故事
<26-4,CASTLE>Because memoirs are about truth.

655
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,600
<26-4,CASTLE>而我并不是一个实话实说的人
<26-4,CASTLE>And I'm not a very truthful person.

656
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,710
<26-4,CASTLE>我很容易把自己写成好人
<26-4,CASTLE>It would be too easy to make myself look good.

657
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,170
<26-5,BECKETT>可能没有你想的那么容易
<26-5,BECKETT>It might be harder than you think..

658
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,080
<26-5,BECKETT>也许
<26-5,BECKETT>Maybe.

659
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,750
<26-6,CASTLE>但是我会从
<26-6,CASTLE>But I would sure start

660
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,700
<26-6,CASTLE>我曾经做过最慷慨的事开始
<26-6,CASTLE>With the most generous thing I ever did.

661
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,730
<26-6,CASTLE>你是说
<26-6,CASTLE>You mean,

662
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,750
<26-7,BECKETT>例如因为你对自己的罪行十分内疚
<26-7,BECKETT>Like how you anonymously sent money to your victims

663
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,820
<26-7,BECKETT>所以匿名给受害者寄钱
<26-7,BECKETT>Because you felt so guilty about what you'd done?

664
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,860
<26-8,CASTLE>欣西亚写回忆录的目的
<26-8,CASTLE>The object of Cynthia's memoir

665
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,470
<26-8,CASTLE>在于博得同情
<26-8,CASTLE>Was to gain sympathy.

666
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,100
<26-8,CASTLE>能有什么比给派克家
<26-8,CASTLE>What could be more sympathetic

667
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,980
<26-8,CASTLE>坚持寄钱20年更值得同情呢
<26-8,CASTLE>Than sending the Pikes guilt money for 20 years?

668
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,730
<26-9,BECKETT>可欣西亚没告诉李·瓦克斯  这点说不通啊
<26-9,BECKETT>It doesn't make sense that Cynthia didn't tell Lee Wax.

669
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,350
<26-9,BECKETT>除非钱不是来自欣西亚
<26-9,BECKETT>A meno che il denaro non venisse da Cynthia.

670
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,450
<27-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>肯定是欣西亚寄的
<27-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>It had to be from Cynthia.

671
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,500
<27-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>斯万斯托在监狱  苏珊·梅勒死了
<27-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>Swanstrom was  in prison and Susan Mailer was dead.

672
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,320
<27-2,JUDGE MARKWAY>跟  你们确定没有其他人了吗
<27-2,JUDGE MARKWAY>Call. And you're sure no one else was involved?

673
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,660
<27-3,CASTLE>没  只有他们三个有可能
<27-3,CASTLE>No, just the three of 'em,

674
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,980
<27-3,CASTLE>如果你信任联调局
<27-3,CASTLE>Assuming you believe the FBI.

675
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,690
<27-3,CASTLE>跟
<27-3,CASTLE>Call.

676
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,680
<27-4,BECKETT>我们不用非得讨论这个吧
<27-4,BECKETT>You know, we don't really have to talk about this.

677
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,410
<27-5,JUDGE MARKWAY>还有不要提及他对于
<27-5,JUDGE MARKWAY>Anything to stop his honour here

678
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,600
<27-5,JUDGE MARKWAY>预算倡议的支持
<27-5,JUDGE MARKWAY>From talking bout budget initiatives.

679
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,920
<27-6,MAYOR>好吧法官  谁刚跟你对着干来着
<27-6,MAYOR>Okay, judge.  Who was it that appointed you again?

680
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,410
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>我信联调局  但为何对欣西亚·德恩
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>Now the FBI believe.  But why take Cynthia Dern's word

681
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,290
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>关于爆炸那天的事情深信不疑呢
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>for anything that happened the night of the bombing

682
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,940
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>甚至她的写手都不信任她
<27-7,JUDGE MARKWAY>When her own ghostwriter didn't even trust her?

683
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,910
<27-8,MAYOR>法官是对的
<27-8,MAYOR>You know, the judge is right.

684
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,300
<27-8,MAYOR>我们到底知道多少真实情况
<27-8,MAYOR>What do we actually know about what happened?

685
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,320
<27-9,BECKETT>还真不多
<27-9,BECKETT>Not much.

686
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,690
<27-9,BECKETT>根据李·瓦克斯的笔记
<27-9,BECKETT>According to Lee Wax's notes,

687
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,890
<27-9,BECKETT>派克船长在爆炸之前
<27-9,BECKETT>Captain Pike heard two women arguing

688
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,290
<27-9,BECKETT>听到了两个女人争执
<27-9,BECKETT>Just before the explosion,

689
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,200
<27-9,BECKETT>而欣西亚又说
<27-9,BECKETT>And Cynthia claims that

690
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,400
<27-9,BECKETT>她那时正试图改变苏珊的主意
<27-9,BECKETT>she was trying to change Susan's mind.

691
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,050
<27-9,BECKETT>不跟
<27-9,BECKETT>Fold.

692
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,530
<27-10,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>但如果我们假设欣西亚在撒谎
<27-10,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>But if we assume Cynthia was lying..

693
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,500
<27-11,MAYOR>那么就是苏珊想救派克
<27-11,MAYOR>Then maybe it was Susan that wanted to save Pikeke

694
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,470
<27-11,MAYOR>而欣西亚想溜
<27-11,MAYOR>And Cynthia that wanted to run.

695
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,910
<27-11,MAYOR>加注20美金
<27-11,MAYOR>Raise $20.

696
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,550
<27-12,CASTLE>对  但是炸弹已经安置好了
<27-12,CASTLE>Right. But the bomb was already set,

697
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,550
<27-12,CASTLE>而三分倒时已开始了
<27-12,CASTLE>So the 3-minute timer is already ticking.

698
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,800
<27-13,JUDGE MARKWAY>女孩们争执  浪费宝贵的时间
<27-13,JUDGE MARKWAY>The girls argue, wasting precious seconds...

699
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,670
<27-14,MAYOR>苏珊朝正倒计时的炸弹跑去
<27-14,MAYOR>Susan runs towards the ticking bomb

700
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,640
<27-14,MAYOR>想把它关了
<27-14,MAYOR>To try to shut it down...

701
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,080
<27-15,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>而欣西亚跑去找掩护保命
<27-15,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>While Cynthia runs for cover.

702
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,180
<27-16,CASTLE>苏珊向炸弹跑去  但是来不及了
<27-16,CASTLE>Right. Susan gets to the bomb, but too late. Boom.

703
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,780
<27-17,MAYOR>就是说
<27-17,MAYOR>Which means

704
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,770
<27-18,CASTLE>苏珊·梅勒不是因引发爆炸而死
<27-18,CASTLE>Susan Mailer didn't die trying to set the bomb.

705
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,680
<27-19,JUDGE MARKWAY>而是为了救那个无辜的船长而死
<27-19,JUDGE MARKWAY>She died trying to save an innocent man's life.

706
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,270
<27-19,JUDGE MARKWAY>不跟
<27-19,JUDGE MARKWAY>Fold.

707
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,970
<27-20,BECKETT>可这仍旧解释不了钱是谁寄的
<27-20,BECKETT>It still doesn't explain where the money came from.

708
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,460
<27-20,BECKETT>不跟
<27-20,BECKETT>Fold.

709
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,470
<27-21,MAYOR>卡塞尔  这是怎么回事  你最擅长诡计
<27-21,MAYOR>Well, what about it, Castle? You're good with twists.

710
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,130
<27-21,MAYOR>说说钱从哪儿来的
<27-21,MAYOR>Where'd the money come from?

711
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
<27-22,CASTLE>我在想呢
<27-22,CASTLE>I'm thinking.

712
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,020
<27-23,BECKETT>没错  你大概在想是否继续跟
<27-23,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you might want to think up some chips for the pot,

713
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,740
<27-23,BECKETT>好像就剩下你和我啦
<27-23,BECKETT>'Cause it looks like it's just you and me.

714
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,790
<27-24,CASTLE>好吧  贝克特探长  我全押
<27-24,CASTLE>All right, detective Beckett.. - I'm all in.

715
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,580
<27-24,CASTLE>怎么  看到真刀真枪害怕了
<27-24,CASTLE>Oh, what's the matter? You afraid of a little action?

716
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,660
<27-25,JUDGE MARKWAY>探长  帮帮忙  让他输个精光
<27-25,JUDGE MARKWAY>Oh, do us a favor, detective. Beat his pants off.

717
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,550
<27-26,CASTLE>有胆量的话  拜托让我输个精光
<27-26,CASTLE>Yes, please, beat my pants off, if you dare.

718
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,960
<27-27,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>贝克特  替我争口气
<27-27,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>Beckett, do me proud.

719
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,410
<27-28,JUDGE MARKWAY>争气啊  让这家伙哭得像个小姑娘
<27-28,JUDGE MARKWAY>To hell with proud, make him cry like a little girl.

720
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,400
<27-29,BECKETT>好吧
<27-29,BECKETT>All right.

721
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,880
<27-30,BECKETT>伙计们  抱歉  我今天手气不好
<27-30,BECKETT>Sorry, fellas, it's just not my night.

722
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,540
<27-31,CASTLE>看看谁是乖孩子
<27-31,CASTLE>Oh, who's a good little boy?

723
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,070
<27-31,CASTLE>谁是乖孩子呢
<27-31,CASTLE>Who's a good little boy?

724
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,850
<27-31,CASTLE>你  你  还有你都是
<27-31,CASTLE>You are and you are and you are.

725
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,560
<27-32,JUDGE MARKWAY>卡塞尔  老赢不烦吗
<27-32,JUDGE MARKWAY>Don't you ever get tired of winning, Castle?

726
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,040
<27-33,CASTLE>你觉得赢钱烦吗  反正我不觉得
<27-33,CASTLE>You'd think so, right? But no.

727
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,640
<27-34,MAYOR>好啦  我要撤了
<27-34,MAYOR>Well, I think that's it for me.

728
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,150
<27-34,MAYOR>探长  能和你玩牌很愉快
<27-34,MAYOR>Detective, it was a pleasure.

729
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,160
<27-35,BECKETT>我也是  市长先生
<27-35,BECKETT>Mr. Mayor.

730
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,070
<27-36,JUDGE MARKWAY>抱歉  没能帮你们把案子破了
<27-36,JUDGE MARKWAY>Sorry we couldn't solve your case.

731
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,900
<27-37,BECKETT>我也很抱歉  没找让他哭得像小姑娘
<27-37,BECKETT>And I'm sorry I couldn't make him cry like a little girl..

732
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,480
<27-38,MAYOR>探长  这不能怪你
<27-38,MAYOR>Mm. Well, it's not your fault, detective.

733
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,800
<27-38,MAYOR>无论他牌运怎么差  总能设法咸鱼翻身
<27-38,MAYOR>No matter how down he gets, he always manages to rise from the dead.

734
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,250
<27-39,CASTLE>-诡计在这里呢  -什么诡计
<27-39,CASTLE>- Oh, now that'd be a twist. - What?

735
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,320
<27-41,CASTLE>伊万斯托还在坐牢
<27-41,CASTLE>The money had to come from Cynthia

736
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,900
<27-41,CASTLE>所以钱只能是欣西亚寄的
<27-41,CASTLE>Because Swanstrom was in jail

737
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,640
<27-41,CASTLE>而且苏珊·梅勒已经死了  对吗
<27-41,CASTLE>And Susan Mailer was dead, right?

738
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,270
<27-42,JUDGE MARKWAY>没错
<27-42,JUDGE MARKWAY>Right.

739
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,270
<27-43,CASTLE>可如果那次爆炸中苏珊·梅勒没被炸死呢
<27-43,CASTLE>But what if Susan Mailer didn't die in that explosion?

740
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,060
<27-43,CASTLE>如果她还尚在人间呢
<27-43,CASTLE>What if she's still alive?

741
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,960
<28-1,RYAN>苏珊·梅勒还活着
<28-1,RYAN>Susan Mailer? Alive?

742
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,240
<28-2,CASTLE>她的尸体一直没找到
<28-2,CASTLE>Her body was never found.

743
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,160
<28-3,BECKETT>因为她在爆炸中人间蒸发了
<28-3,BECKETT>Yeah, because she was vaporized in the explosion.

744
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,920
<28-4,CASTLE>也许她只是被炸伤了
<28-4,CASTLE>Well, maybe she was thrown clear.

745
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,560
<28-5,ESPOSITO>她受到重度烧伤  需要救治
<28-5,ESPOSITO>And she would been  badly burned and would've need care.

746
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,540
<28-6,RYAN>可在本地医院里
<28-6,RYAN>And no one matching her description

747
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,100
<28-6,RYAN>并没有与她情况相符的医疗记录
<28-6,RYAN>Ever checked into area hospitals.

748
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,850
<28-7,CASTLE>好兄弟  再挖点细节出来
<28-7,CASTLE>Mere details, my good man.

749
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,900
<28-8,BECKETT>听着  我们这里称其为  事实
<28-8,BECKETT>Um, around here we call them "facts."

750
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:39,180
<28-9,CASTLE>好吧  那让我们多找些事实出来
<28-9,CASTLE>Well, then let's go get us some facts.

751
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,000
<29-1,ELEANOR>请不要因此瞧不起我
<29-1,ELEANOR>Please don't think less of me.

752
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,960
<29-1,ELEANOR>我这么做只为了生存
<29-1,ELEANOR>I did what I had to do to survive.

753
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,820
<29-2,BECKETT>这些钱从不同的地方寄来
<29-2,BECKETT>These are from all over the place.

754
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,260
<29-3,ADAM>这些不是最近寄来的
<29-3,ADAM>Uh, not the recent ones

755
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,540
<29-3,ADAM>最近寄来的都出自同一地址
<29-3,ADAM>The recent ones are all the same.

756
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,980
<29-4,BECKETT>利帝兹  宾西法尼亚州
<29-4,BECKETT>Lititz, Pennsylvania.

757
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,340
<29-5,CASTLE>跑长途前  我得上个厕所
<29-5,CASTLE>If we're gonna road-Trip, I'm gonna have to pee first.

758
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,310
<30-1,POST OFFICE CLERK>-从来没见过这女人  -能肯定吗
<30-1,POST OFFICE CLERK>- I've never seen her before. - Are you positive?

759
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,060
<30-2,BECKETT>-他的口气像不肯定吗  -卡塞尔
<30-2,BECKETT>- Didn't he sound positive? - Castle.

760
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,060
<30-4,BECKETT>好吧
<30-4,BECKETT>Okay.

761
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,140
<30-5,BECKETT>这个女人呢
<30-5,BECKETT>How about her?

762
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,470
<30-6,BECKETT>-她现在应该老了些  -老多少
<30-6,BECKETT>- She'd be older now. - How much older?

763
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,630
<30-8,CASTLE>20岁
<30-8,CASTLE>20 years.

764
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,830
<30-9,POST OFFICE CLERK>没见过
<30-9,POST OFFICE CLERK>I don't think so.

765
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,830
<30-10,BECKETT>听个神秘小说家的话  就这个结果
<30-10,BECKETT>That's what I get for listening to a mystery writer.

766
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,720
<30-11,CASTLE>-她可能现在有伤疤或跛脚
<30-11,CASTLE>She might have scars or walk with a limp.

767
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,320
<30-12,POST OFFICE CLERK>像出过什么意外吗
<30-12,POST OFFICE CLERK>Like she's been in an accident?

768
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,050
<30-12,POST OFFICE CLERK>可能是玛丽·莱特
<30-12,POST OFFICE CLERK>It could be Mary Wright.

769
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,860
<30-13,BECKETT>玛丽·莱特
<30-13,BECKETT>Mary Wright?

770
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,180
<30-14,POST OFFICE CLERK>她每个月来一次  我想是她
<30-14,POST OFFICE CLERK>She comes in once a month or so.

771
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,970
<30-14,POST OFFICE CLERK>每次来给纽约的亲戚汇款
<30-14,POST OFFICE CLERK>Buys a money order to send to her relatives in new york.

772
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,020
<30-15,BECKETT>你有她的家庭住址吗
<30-15,BECKETT>Do you have her address?

773
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,430
<31-1,SUSAN>这么说可能有点天真  但是
<31-1,SUSAN>It sounds naive now, but, um...

774
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,940
<31-1,SUSAN>当年  我那么做是因为
<31-1,SUSAN>Everything I did back then I did because

775
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,580
<31-1,SUSAN>我当时认为那是种帮助
<31-1,SUSAN>I thought it would help.

776
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,820
<31-2,BECKETT>苏珊我们今天找你来  不是想说爆炸的事
<31-2,BECKETT>We're not here because of the bombing, Susan.

777
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,400
<31-2,BECKETT>我们要听的是  你对欣西亚·德恩做的事
<31-2,BECKETT>We're here because of what you did to Cynthia Dern.

778
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,070
<31-3,CASTLE>尸体是在盛满机油的浴缸里  被人发现的
<31-3,CASTLE>Her body was found in a tub of motor oil.

779
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,140
<31-3,CASTLE>看来你已经知道了
<31-3,CASTLE>But you already know that.

780
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,740
<31-4,BECKETT>在我们谈话的同时  法证科也在调查这起案件
<31-4,BECKETT>Forensics is going through that room as we speak.

781
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,080
<31-4,BECKETT>我敢肯定  他们会找到蛛丝马迹
<31-4,BECKETT>And believe me, they will find something,

782
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,740
<31-4,BECKETT>证明你与欣西亚的死有关系
<31-4,BECKETT>Something that connects you to Cynthia's death.

783
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,250
<31-5,SUSAN>那种陈年旧事  她本不应该再提起
<31-5,SUSAN>She should've just left it all alone.

784
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,540
<31-5,SUSAN>她嫁了人  生活幸福
<31-5,SUSAN>She had a husband and a good life.

785
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,250
<31-5,SUSAN>可欣西亚不甘心过那种生活
<31-5,SUSAN>But that wasn't Cynthia.

786
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,380
<31-5,SUSAN>一旦她决心做什么事
<31-5,SUSAN>Once she decided on something,

787
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,110
<31-5,SUSAN>周围人最好乖乖让开路
<31-5,SUSAN>Well, you just better not be in her way.

788
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,490
<31-6,CASTLE>就像那晚在油轮上是吗
<31-6,CASTLE>Like that night on the tanker?

789
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,220
<31-7,SUSAN>我看到船长走下来
<31-7,SUSAN>I saw the captain go below.

790
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,270
<31-7,SUSAN>可不知怎么他半路折回  我们没发现
<31-7,SUSAN>I don't know how he got back onboard without us seeing.

791
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,780
<31-7,SUSAN>我本想
<31-7,SUSAN>I- I tried...

792
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,000
<31-7,SUSAN>可我  太迟啦
<31-7,SUSAN>But I was.. I was too late.

793
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,740
<31-7,SUSAN>炸弹爆炸时  我被弹出了甲板
<31-7,SUSAN>When the bomb exploded, I was thrown overboard.

794
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,200
<31-7,SUSAN>我还能感觉到  热浪腐灼着皮肤
<31-7,SUSAN>I can still feel the heat on my skin...

795
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,590
<31-7,SUSAN>到今天都忘不了
<31-7,SUSAN>Even today.

796
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,330
<31-8,BECKETT>没去医院  你是怎么活下来的
<31-8,BECKETT>How did you survive without medical attention?

797
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,890
<31-9,SUSAN>有个朋友收留我
<31-9,SUSAN>Um, a friend took me in.

798
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,040
<31-9,SUSAN>有位医学院的学生照顾我  直到我完全康复
<31-9,SUSAN>A- A med student nursed me back to health.

799
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,020
<31-10,CASTLE>-我弄到个新身份  -变成了玛丽·莱特
<31-10,CASTLE>- I got a new identity. - And Mary Wright was born.

800
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,210
<31-11,SUSAN>如果所有人都以为你死了
<31-11,SUSAN>It's not hard to live like a ghost

801
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,380
<31-11,SUSAN>你就不会过得那么艰难
<31-11,SUSAN>When everyone you love thinks you're dead.a.

802
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,130
<31-11,SUSAN>从此断绝了与所有认识人的联系
<31-11,SUSAN>I never contacted anyone from my former life...

803
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,670
<31-11,SUSAN>连父母都没联系过
<31-11,SUSAN>Not even my parents.

804
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,110
<31-12,BECKETT>可你一直给派克家寄钱
<31-12,BECKETT>But you still sent money to the Pikes.

805
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,770
<31-13,SUSAN>他有个儿子  需要医疗费
<31-13,SUSAN>They had a son... medical bills.

806
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,210
<31-13,SUSAN>我有责任这么做
<31-13,SUSAN>I- I was responsible.

807
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,850
<31-13,SUSAN>本来一切可以相安无事  可是
<31-13,SUSAN>Everything could've stayed just the way it was except...

808
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,890
<31-14,CASTLE>可是  欣西亚要出书
<31-14,CASTLE>Except Cynthia decided to write a book..

809
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,410
<31-15,SUSAN>那个记者在环境版上发了个帖子
<31-15,SUSAN>That reporter put a post on an environmental board

810
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,880
<31-15,SUSAN>询问欣西亚的情况
<31-15,SUSAN>Asking for info on Cynthia.

811
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,750
<31-15,SUSAN>我以组织老成员的身份  写了封电子邮件
<31-15,SUSAN>I e-mailed, pretending to be an old friend of the group.

812
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,420
<31-15,SUSAN>时日不多  我就发现
<31-15,SUSAN>It didn't take long for me to figure out

813
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,590
<31-15,SUSAN>那记者已经找到欣西亚
<31-15,SUSAN>That she had found Cynthia and

814
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,930
<31-15,SUSAN>而欣西亚就船上发生的事说了谎
<31-15,SUSAN>Cynthia was lying about what happened on the ship.

815
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,460
<31-16,BECKETT>你找到她  和她对质
<31-16,BECKETT>You tracked her down. You confronted her.

816
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,720
<31-17,SUSAN>我威胁她  如果写本书
<31-17,SUSAN>I threatened to turn myself in

817
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,260
<31-17,SUSAN>我就去自首
<31-17,SUSAN>If she went through with the book..

818
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,160
<31-17,SUSAN>把所有的事情全抖出来
<31-17,SUSAN>Give myself up, tell the authorities everything.

819
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,180
<31-17,SUSAN>她恳求要先见见我
<31-17,SUSAN>She begged to meet with me first..

820
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,920
<31-17,SUSAN>找个地方谈谈
<31-17,SUSAN>Somewhere we could talk.

821
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,340
<31-18,CASTLE>所以你租下那个房间
<31-18,CASTLE>That's when you rented the room?

822
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,780
<31-19,SUSAN>不是我  欣西亚租的房间
<31-19,SUSAN>Oh, no, Cynthia rented the room, not me.

823
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,680
<31-19,SUSAN>-那是她计划里的一部分  -她的计划
<31-19,SUSAN>- It was all part of her plan. - Her plan?

824
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,050
<31-20,BECKETT>她计划要杀我
<31-20,BECKETT>Her plan to murder me.

825
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,850
<31-21,SUSAN>等我到那里  她递来一杯酒
<31-21,SUSAN>W- When I got there, she poured me a drink.

826
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,870
<31-21,SUSAN>嘴里说  为老友干杯
<31-21,SUSAN>"Let's toast to old friends," she said.

827
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
<31-21,SUSAN>只不过  我不喝酒
<31-21,SUSAN>Only, you see, I don't drink.

828
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,290
<31-21,SUSAN>我想走  可她不让
<31-21,SUSAN>I tried to leave. She wouldn't let me.

829
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,650
<31-21,SUSAN>我就躲进了盥洗室
<31-21,SUSAN>I- I hid in the bathroom.

830
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,030
<31-21,SUSAN>知道我看见什么了
<31-21,SUSAN>That's when I saw it...

831
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,960
<31-21,SUSAN>满满一浴缸的油
<31-21,SUSAN>The tub, full of oil.

832
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,920
<31-21,SUSAN>我一下子明白过来
<31-21,SUSAN>Then I understood.

833
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,510
<31-22,CASTLE>她就没想找你谈
<31-22,CASTLE>She didn't plan to talk to you.

834
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,630
<31-22,CASTLE>只想把你解决掉
<31-22,CASTLE>She planned to kill you

835
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,210
<31-22,CASTLE>再把现场布置成自杀的样子
<31-22,CASTLE>and make it look like suicide.

836
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,210
<31-22,CASTLE>那杯酒里下了安眠药
<31-22,CASTLE>That wine was laced with a sleeping pill.

837
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,970
<31-22,CASTLE>你本应喝下酒  再淹死在润滑油里
<31-22,CASTLE>You were supposed to drink it and then drown in the oil.

838
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:43,540
<31-23,BECKETT>之后  全世界都会认为
<31-23,BECKETT>And then the world would think that you were

839
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,080
<31-23,BECKETT>多年来  你因为派克一家的遭遇倍受煎熬
<31-23,BECKETT>Racked with guilt over the Pikes all these years

840
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,430
<31-23,BECKETT>最后决定自杀
<31-23,BECKETT>And that you finally decided to commit suicide

841
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,130
<31-24,CASTLE>一旦有人发现你的尸体
<31-24,CASTLE>Once your body was discovered,

842
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,100
<31-24,CASTLE>大众就会对事情的真相趋之若骛
<31-24,CASTLE>the public would clamor for the true story..

843
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,790
<31-24,CASTLE>当然是欣西亚嘴里的真相
<31-24,CASTLE>Cynthia's true story..

844
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,330
<31-24,CASTLE>而你则被塑造成一个恶棍
<31-24,CASTLE>With you now cast as the villain.

845
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,330
<31-25,SUSAN>我们扭打起来
<31-25,SUSAN>We struggled.

846
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,140
<31-25,SUSAN>她失去了平衡  撞到洗脸盆上
<31-25,SUSAN>She lost her balance and fell against the sink and...

847
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,740
<31-25,SUSAN>她撞到了头
<31-25,SUSAN>Hit her head.

848
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,640
<31-25,SUSAN>我本该找人来救她
<31-25,SUSAN>I should've called for help,

849
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,870
<31-25,SUSAN>可我想就此做个了断
<31-25,SUSAN>But I just wanted it to be over.

850
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,690
<31-25,SUSAN>所以  我
<31-25,SUSAN>So I...

851
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,990
<31-25,SUSAN>把她拖向浴缸
<31-25,SUSAN>I dragged her to the tub and...

852
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,250
<31-25,SUSAN>我
<31-25,SUSAN>I...

853
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,200
<31-25,SUSAN>把她推倒
<31-25,SUSAN>I pushed her in.

854
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,960
<31-25,SUSAN>其实  我已经是死人了
<31-25,SUSAN>You see, I was already dead.

855
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,620
<31-25,SUSAN>就想继续当死人
<31-25,SUSAN>I just wanted to keep it that way.

856
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,030
<32-1,LEE>听说  你们已经抓到人了
<32-1,LEE>I heard you made an arrest.

857
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,080
<32-2,CASTLE>具体情况可以看早间新闻
<32-2,CASTLE>You can hear all about it in the morning news.

858
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,510
<32-3,LEE>得了  我在这件案子上全力帮助你们
<32-3,LEE>Oh, come on, after all the help I gave you on this case,

859
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,680
<32-3,LEE>难道你就不能多透露点消息吗
<32-3,LEE>You can't give me any more information than that?

860
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,080
<32-4,CASTLE>倒不是不能  不过我在想
<32-4,CASTLE>Well, I could, but I just keep thinking

861
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,690
<32-4,CASTLE>如果不是你  案子也许就不会发生
<32-4,CASTLE>That if it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be a case in the first place.

862
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,000
<32-5,LEE>这是什么意思
<32-5,LEE>What does that mean?

863
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,090
<32-6,CASTLE>你采访过的每个与欣西亚过去有关联的人
<32-6,CASTLE>Tutte le persone del passato di Cynthia that you interviewed..

864
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,140
<32-6,CASTLE>你用什么方法让他们知道
<32-6,CASTLE>How did you manage to let every one of them know

865
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,820
<32-6,CASTLE>你和欣西亚在联系呢
<32-6,CASTLE>That you were in contact with her?

866
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,200
<32-7,LEE>你在暗示什么
<32-7,LEE>What are you implying?

867
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,160
<32-8,CASTLE>你想让人发现其中的端倪  然后去报警
<32-8,CASTLE>You wanted someone to put two and two together  and call the cops.

868
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,170
<32-8,CASTLE>把欣西亚扔进监狱
<32-8,CASTLE>You wanted Cynthia in prison.

869
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,770
<32-8,CASTLE>这样一来  你和欣西亚之间的合约就会无效
<32-8,CASTLE>That way, you could tear up the contract you had with her

870
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,860
<32-8,CASTLE>接着  按照自己的想法写书
<32-8,CASTLE>And write the story you wanted to write

871
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,600
<32-8,CASTLE>编个能增加销量的结局
<32-8,CASTLE>With an ending that would sell more books.

872
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,010
<32-8,CASTLE>可你自己不能向当局告发欣西亚
<32-8,CASTLE>I mean, you couldn't call the authorities yourself.

873
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,480
<32-8,CASTLE>那样的话  故事的命运要如何呢
<32-8,CASTLE>What kind of story would that be?

874
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,520
<32-9,LEE>理论还算可听
<32-9,LEE>That's a lovely theory,

875
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:53,600
<32-9,LEE>即便如此  欣西亚·德恩也不是我杀的
<32-9,LEE>But even if it's true, I didn't kill Cynthia Dern.

876
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,920
<32-9,LEE>没干过任何违法的事情
<32-9,LEE>I didn't even do anything illegal.

877
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,300
<32-10,CASTLE>这不关违法的事
<32-10,CASTLE>Oh, no, no, no, it's not illegal.

878
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,410
<32-10,CASTLE>只是很恶心
<32-10,CASTLE>It's just slimy.

879
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,930
<32-10,CASTLE>所以你这张特别通行证作废了
<32-10,CASTLE>So your, uh, all-access pass has been revoked.

880
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,390
<32-11,CASTLE>还有件事
<32-11,CASTLE>Oh, and one more thing..

881
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,410
<32-11,CASTLE>有一天  就在不久的将来
<32-11,CASTLE>One day, and one day not far from now,

882
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,950
<32-11,CASTLE>我会把这个故事写进自己的小说
<32-11,CASTLE>I'm gonna use this in a book.

883
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,450
<32-12,BECKETT>苏珊·梅勒已收监
<32-12,BECKETT>Susan Mailer's in booking.

884
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,660
<32-13,CASTLE>这么多年来
<32-13,CASTLE>Mm. All these years,

885
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,000
<32-13,CASTLE>她都在纠正以前犯下的过错  一直在做弥补
<32-13,CASTLE>Trying to do the right thing, trying to make amends...

886
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,910
<32-13,CASTLE>可因为欣西亚的贪婪  到头来还是要坐牢
<32-13,CASTLE>Because of Cynthia's greed, she's gonna end up in jail.

887
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,630
<32-14,BECKETT>想看大团圆结局
<32-14,BECKETT>If you're looking for a happy ending,

888
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,840
<32-14,BECKETT>你恐怕走错地方了
<32-14,BECKETT>You've come to the wrong place.

889
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,760
<32-15,CASTLE>下次我想去  第二大道的按摩院试试
<32-15,CASTLE>Next time, I guess I'll just  try that massage parlor on 2nd avenue.

890
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,100
<32-16,CASTLE>说说而已
<32-16,CASTLE>Just kidding.

891
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,670
<32-16,CASTLE>实际上  这种故事哪里会有大团圆结局
<32-16,CASTLE>Actually, who needs a happy ending when you have a story with

892
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,860
<32-16,CASTLE>故事的人物制造已死的假象
<32-16,CASTLE>people pretending to be dead,

893
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,880
<32-16,CASTLE>隐姓埋名
<32-16,CASTLE>Living under assumed names,

894
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,970
<32-16,CASTLE>布下自杀假象  为了报复而杀人
<32-16,CASTLE>Plotting fake suicides and murder for revenge?

895
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,960
<32-17,BECKETT>我很高兴看着你这样自娱自乐
<32-17,BECKETT>You know, I'm glad to see that you're entertained

896
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,830
<32-17,BECKETT>可我还得给迈克尔·高德曼打电话
<32-17,BECKETT>I, however, have to call michael Goldman

897
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,100
<32-17,BECKETT>告诉他  自己的妻子是个反社会份子
<32-17,BECKETT>And let him know that his wife was a sociopath.

898
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,330
<32-18,CASTLE>你也要通知贾内德·斯万斯托
<32-18,CASTLE>But you also get to call Jared Swanstrom and tell him

899
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,690
<32-18,CASTLE>告诉他  不必对苏珊·梅勒的死负责
<32-18,CASTLE>That he's no longer responsible for Susan Mailer's death.

900
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,230
<32-18,CASTLE>事实上苏珊·梅勒还活着
<32-18,CASTLE>As a matter of fact, Susan Mailer's still alive.

901
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,840
<32-19,BECKETT>却导致了欣西亚的死
<32-19,BECKETT>Which is why Cynthia is now dead.

902
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,820
<32-20,CASTLE>你总是这么破坏气氛吗
<32-20,CASTLE>Wow, you are all about the cloud, aren't you?

903
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,970
<32-20,CASTLE>从不懂得  拨云见日
<32-20,CASTLE>Never the silver ling.

904
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,880
<32-20,CASTLE>好吧  也许这个会让你开心点
<32-20,CASTLE>Okay. Maybe this might cheer you up a little bit.

905
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,410
<32-20,CASTLE>你赢的
<32-20,CASTLE>Your winnings.

906
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,460
<32-21,BECKETT>我赢的吗
<32-21,BECKETT>My winnings?

907
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,540
<32-22,CASTLE>别故作扭捏  那把牌是你让我的
<32-22,CASTLE>Oh, don't play coy with me. You threw your hand.

908
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,740
<32-23,BECKETT>好吧  我只是做个好人
<32-23,BECKETT>All right, I was trying to be nice.

909
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,080
<32-23,BECKETT>不想让你在朋友面前下不来台
<32-23,BECKETT>I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.

910
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,910
<32-24,CASTLE>现在我们两清了
<32-24,CASTLE>Now we're even,

911
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,530
<32-24,CASTLE>再决雌雄怎么样
<32-24,CASTLE>So what do you say to a little showdown?

912
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,490
<32-25,CASTLE>面对面  单打独斗
<32-25,CASTLE>Head-To-Head. Toe-To-Toe.

913
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,420
<32-25,CASTLE>赢家通吃
<32-25,CASTLE>Winner take all.

<32-34,BECKETT>我带了一袋小熊橡皮糖
<32-34,BECKETT>I think I got a bag of gummy bears.

921

<32-35,CASTLE>洗牌
<32-35,CASTLE>Shuffle.

<32-37,CASTLE>是扑克都会打
<32-37,CASTLE>I'm comfy so long as my cards come from the top of the deck.

<32-38,BECKETT>Huh. What you got up your sleeves?

926
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,380
<32-39,CASTLE>要见识一下  结实的臂膀之外的本领吗
<32-39,CASTLE>Aside from my muscular arms?
