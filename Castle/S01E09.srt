<1-2,BECKETT>- How did you know-- - I'm a novelist.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,800
<1-3,CASTLE>我的工作就是留意生活
<1-3,CASTLE>It's my job to notice things.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,800
<1-4,BECKETT>星期天一清早
<1-4,BECKETT>It's Sunday morning.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
<1-4,BECKETT>应该是你花天酒地完后回家的时候吧
<1-4,BECKETT>Shouldn't you be slinking home from a scandalous liaison?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,510
<1-5,CASTLE>如果真是这样  你会吃醋吗
<1-5,CASTLE>Would you be jealous if I were?

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,000
<1-6,BECKETT>做梦去吧
<1-6,BECKETT>In your dreams.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,400
<1-7,CASTLE>其实  在我的梦里你从来不吃醋
<1-7,CASTLE>Actually, in my dreams you're never jealous.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
<1-7,CASTLE>在我的梦里  你会一起来...
<1-7,CASTLE>In my dreams, you just joined in

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,100
<1-8,CASTLE>蒙哥马利打电话说他马上过来
<1-8,CASTLE>Well, Montgomery called and said, "come down right away,"

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,300
<1-8,CASTLE>所以这个案子肯定不一般
<1-8,CASTLE>So it must be gruesome.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,220
<1-9,BECKETT>每次我们去案发现场的时候
<1-9,BECKETT>Try not to get so giddy

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,500
<1-9,BECKETT>别显得那么开心好吗
<1-9,BECKETT>Every time we go to a crime scene, okay?

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,800
<1-10,CASTLE>不过死个人  不必这么气急败坏吧
<1-10,CASTLE>Just 'cause somebody's dead doesn't mean you have to be grumpy.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
<1-11,BECKETT>想看看什么叫做气急败坏吗
<1-11,BECKETT>Oh, do you want to see grumpy?

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,100
<1-11,BECKETT>看看你那本新书的封面
<1-11,BECKETT>How about the cover art for your new novel?

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,600
<1-12,CASTLE>你是指《妮基·希特》的封面吗
<1-12,CASTLE>"Nikki heat" cover art?

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,400
<1-12,CASTLE>封面不是只能在...

24
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,130
<1-14,BECKETT>你知不知道很多人
<1-14,BECKETT>You do realize that

25
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,200
<1-14,BECKETT>被匿名的疯狂粉丝吓跑的
<1-14,BECKETT>Most people would be creeped out by crazy, anonymous fans?

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,400
<1-15,CASTLE>你这样的粉丝
<1-15,CASTLE>Like you?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,300
<1-16,BECKETT>我完全是出于职业好奇心
<1-16,BECKETT>It was strictly professional curiosity.

28
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,800
<1-17,CASTLE>觉得你这个新生形象如何
<1-17,CASTLE>So what did you think of your alter ego Nikki?

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,800
<1-17,CASTLE>-很甜美吧  -那叫甜美
<1-17,CASTLE>- Pretty sweet, right? - "Sweet"?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,500
<1-18,BECKETT>那是一丝不挂
<1-18,BECKETT>She's naked!

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,000
<1-19,CASTLE>并非一丝不挂  构图上看她还挂着一把枪
<1-19,CASTLE>She's not naked. She's holding a gun...strategically.

32
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,300
<1-19,CASTLE>要知道...
<1-19,CASTLE>You know...

33
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,000
<1-20,BECKETT>令我感到好受一些的是
<1-20,BECKETT>I take comfort in the fact

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,300
<1-20,BECKETT>这本书一旦问世
<1-20,BECKETT>That if they're already publishing the cover art,

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,700
<1-20,BECKETT>你连书带人就跟我们没什么瓜葛了
<1-20,BECKETT>Then your book and our little partnership is almost done.

<1-21,UNIFORM>咖啡不能拿进去  先生

<1-22,BECKETT>长官  出什么事了
<1-22,BECKETT>Sir, what's going on?

00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
<1-24,BECKETT>尸体在哪里发现的
<1-24,BECKETT>Where'd they find the body?

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,000
<1-25,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>还没找到  她被绑架了
<1-25,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>They haven't found her. She was abducted.

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,600
<1-25,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>当时她爸爸在隔壁房间画画

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,600
<1-26,CASTLE>在她家里遭到绑架
<1-26,CASTLE>Kidnapped from her home?

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
<1-27,BECKETT>我不明白  长官  如果不是谋杀
<1-27,BECKETT>I don't understand, sir. If this isn't a murder,

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
<1-27,BECKETT>要我来干嘛
<1-27,BECKETT>Why am I here?

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
<1-28,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>联邦调查局要你来的
<1-28,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>The feds requested you to be on the task force.

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,300
<1-29,CASTLE>联邦调查局
<1-29,CASTLE>Feds?

48
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
<1-30,BECKETT>联调局对儿童绑架案有管理权限
<1-30,BECKETT>FBI has jurisdiction over child abduction cases.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,100

<1-31,CASTLE>Then why call me?

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,700
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>因为我想气气联调局这帮家伙
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>'Cause I like pissing off the FBI,

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,300
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>还有  你从不按常理出牌
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>And because you think outside the box.

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>这是联调局的人员做不到的
<1-32,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>That's something the febs rarely do.

53
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
<1-33,BECKETT>长官  谁负责这案子

<1-58,SORENSON>只要不妨碍调查
<1-58,SORENSON>I have no problem with it

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,500
<1-58,SORENSON>我没什么意见
<1-58,SORENSON>As long as it doesn't interfere with the investigation.

89
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,000
<1-60,SORENSON>当时父母在家
<1-60,SORENSON>Parents were home at the time.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
<1-61,CASTLE>父母都在家  怎么还会被绑架
<1-61,CASTLE>How do you get abducted when your parents are home?

91
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
<1-63,SORENSON>大约七点爸爸叫孩子起床
<1-63,SORENSON>Dad got up with the kid about 7:00,

92
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,200
<1-63,SORENSON>妈妈还没起床
<1-63,SORENSON>Let the mom sleep in.

93
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
<1-63,SORENSON>他把安吉拉放到电视机前
<1-63,SORENSON>He planted Angela in front of the tube

<1-63,SORENSON>Then headed into his art studio.

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
<1-64,SORENSON>显然  他是个画家
<1-64,SORENSON>Obviously, he's a painter.

97
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,400
<1-65,CASTLE>他就这样把孩子扔在一边
<1-65,CASTLE>He just left his kid?

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,000
<1-66,BECKETT>至少他听得到一点声响吧
<1-66,BECKETT>Did he hear anything at least?

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
<1-67,SORENSON>他当时正听着Ipod
<1-67,SORENSON>He was listening to his ipod.

100
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,900
<1-68,CASTLE>没个做爸爸的样子

<22-1,BECKETT>When I couldn't find her, I looked everywhere for her,

103
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,400
<2-1,ALFRED>然后我看到了打开的窗户
<2-1,ALFRED>And then I saw the window.

104
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,300
<2-2,SORENSON>锁从外面被撬开了
<2-2,SORENSON>The lock was jimmied from the outside.

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
<2-3,ALFRED>我跑到外面找

106
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
<2-4,BECKETT>坎德拉先生  你们住在一楼
<2-4,BECKETT>Mr. Candela, you live on a ground floor apartment

107
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
<2-4,BECKETT>窗户正对着巷子
<2-4,BECKETT>With windows facing the alleyway.

108
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,600
<2-4,BECKETT>一般人们都会装栅栏
<2-4,BECKETT>Most people have bars.

109
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,100
<2-5,THERESA>本来打算装的  只是
<2-5,THERESA>We were going to. We just--

110
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,700
<2-6,ALFRED>我没时间
<2-6,ALFRED>I never got around to it.

111
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,900
<2-7,SORENSON>我们认为这些泥土是从外面带进来的
<2-7,SORENSON>We think the dirt's from the outside.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,500
<2-8,ALFRED>这种事情怎么会发上在我们自己家里
<2-8,ALFRED>How could this happen in our own home?

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
<2-9,BECKETT>看来疑犯是从窗户爬进来
<2-9,BECKETT>So our suspect climbed in through the window,

114
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,900
<2-9,BECKETT>抓了安吉拉  然后从后门走出去
<2-9,BECKETT>Grabbed Angela and probably walked out the back door.

115
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,700
<2-10,CASTLE>就这样吗
<2-10,CASTLE>Just like that?

116
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,000
<2-11,SORENSON>我们已经把她的照片发出去
<2-11,SORENSON>We have her photo on the wires

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,700
<2-11,SORENSON>并向出入境管理局和州际地区发出安珀警报
<2-11,SORENSON>And are issuing an amber alert to the port authority and the tri-State area.

118
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,100
<2-12,BECKETT>我让我的人查一查
<2-12,BECKETT>I'll have my guys run

119
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,200
<2-12,BECKETT>有案底的强奸犯和入室盗窃犯
<2-12,BECKETT>Any registered sex offenders and residential burglaries.

120
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,600
<2-12,BECKETT>孩子的父母呢
<2-12,BECKETT>What about the parents?

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
<2-12,BECKETT>他们能想到哪些人
<2-12,BECKETT>Anyone they can think of?

122
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
<2-13,SORENSON>没有  两个人暂时还提供不了什么情况
<2-13,SORENSON>No, not that either of them can think straight right now.

123
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,600
<2-14,CASTLE>情况继续恶化的话  他们就没机会想了
<2-14,CASTLE>This thing goes south, they'll never think straight again.

124
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,900
<2-15,FBI TECH>索伦森探员
<2-15,FBI TECH>Agent Sorenson?

125
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
<2-16,SORENSON>电话在那边  装上监听器
<2-16,SORENSON>The phone's over there. Get a tap on it.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,700
<2-17,SORENSON>这件案子会有好结果的
<2-17,SORENSON>This one will end better.

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,300
<2-17,SORENSON>我保证
<2-17,SORENSON>I promise.

128
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,500
<3-1,BECKETT>六个月
<3-1,BECKETT>Six months.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
<3-2,CASTLE>六个月什么
<3-2,CASTLE>Six months what?

130
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
<3-3,BECKETT>我们交往了六个月
<3-3,BECKETT>We dated for six months.

131
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
<3-4,CASTLE>我又没问你
<3-4,CASTLE>I didn't ask.

132
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,500
<3-5,BECKETT>我知道
<3-5,BECKETT>Yeah, I know.

133
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
<3-5,BECKETT>你只不过没有喊出来而已
<3-5,BECKETT>You were not asking very loudly.

134
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,900
<3-6,CASTLE>感觉自己像绝地武士一样有心灵感应
<3-6,CASTLE>I know. I'm like a jedi like that.

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,200

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,700
<3-10,BECKETT>抓到了罪犯
<3-10,BECKETT>We got the guy.

<3-19,CASTLE>我觉得是鞭婚
<3-19,CASTLE>I believe it's the whipped.

153
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
<3-23,RYAN>母亲泰丽莎  是凯勒·斯丹顿的财务经理
<3-23,RYAN>Mom-- Theresa, she's a fund manager at Keller Stanton.

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,900
<3-23,RYAN>父亲是个三流的画家
<3-23,RYAN>Dad's a small-time artist,

155
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,100
<3-23,RYAN>其作品只在切尔西的格雷森画廊展出一次
<3-23,RYAN>Shows at the Greyson Gallery in Chelsea once in a while.

156
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,900
<3-23,RYAN>邻居说  他在家带孩子
<3-23,RYAN>Neighbor says he stays home with the kid.

157
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,400
<3-24,BECKETT>这里有张名单
<3-24,BECKETT>All right, here's a list of all the people

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,000
<3-24,BECKETT>都是可能进入他们家的人
<3-24,BECKETT>Who had access to the apartment--

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
<3-24,BECKETT>保姆  清洁工  公寓管理员
<3-24,BECKETT>Babysitters, cleaning lady, super.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,700
<3-24,BECKETT>把这些人与本地在册的强奸犯作个对比
<3-24,BECKETT>Let's cross-Reference that with any registered sex offenders in the area,

161
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,400
<3-24,BECKETT>看看是否有恋童癖
<3-24,BECKETT>See if anyone had a thing for little girls.

162
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,500
<3-25,ESPOSITO>你认为可能是公寓内部有偷窥狂吗
<3-25,ESPOSITO>You're thinking that some creepy-crawly probably scouted from the inside?

163
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,500
<3-26,BECKETT>父亲说今早做的事跟往常一样
<3-26,BECKETT>Well, the father said what he did this morning was part of a routine.

164
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,390
<3-26,BECKETT>所以要么是罪犯走运
<3-26,BECKETT>So either somebody got lucky,

165
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,500
<3-26,BECKETT>要么是对情况了如指掌
<3-26,BECKETT>Or they already knew it.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
<3-26,BECKETT>好  我们马上到
<3-26,BECKETT>Yeah, we'll be right there.

168
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
<3-26,BECKETT>似乎不是偷窥狂
<3-26,BECKETT>Looks like it wasn't a creepy-crawler after all.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
<3-26,BECKETT>坎德拉家刚接到一个勒索电话
<3-26,BECKETT>Candelas just got a ransom call.

170
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,070
<4-1,THERESA>喂
<4-1,THERESA>Hello?

171
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,470
<4-2,SCRAMBLED VOICE>你们的女儿在我手上
<4-2,SCRAMBLED VOICE>We have your daughter.

172
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,070
<4-3,THERESA>求你了  她只是个孩子  求你不要伤害她
<4-3,THERESA>Please, she's just a child. Please don't hurt her.

173
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,670
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>那就看你们怎么做了
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Whether we hurt her is up to you.

174
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,570
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>你们的所为将决定她的生死
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Whether she lives is up to you.

175
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,970
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>想要你们的女儿吗
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>You want your daughter?

176
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,070
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>拿75万来  给你们24小时
<4-4,SCRAMBLED VOICE>We want $750,000. You have 24 hours.

177
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,570
<4-5,THERESA>我要跟她说话  我要知道她是否没事
<4-5,THERESA>I want to speak to her. I want to know she's safe.

178
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,570
<4-6,SORENSON>他们用的是网络电话
<4-6,SORENSON>They used an internet voice-over-I.P. Service.

179
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,570
<4-7,BECKETT>就是说无法追踪
<4-7,BECKETT>Meaning it's untraceable.

180
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,070
<4-8,SORENSON>你们拿得出75万吗
<4-8,SORENSON>Can you raise the 750?

181
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,770
<4-9,THERESA>75万是我们的全部家当
<4-9,THERESA>It-- It's everything we have.

182
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,970
<4-10,ALFRED>只要能让安吉拉回来  我们会给他的
<4-10,ALFRED>If it means getting Angela back, we'll pay.

183
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,870
<4-11,SORENSON>那你们就赶紧开始筹钱吧
<4-11,SORENSON>Then you should start getting your financial records together.

184
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,570
<4-12,BECKETT>坎德拉太太  有没有什么人能帮你
<4-12,BECKETT>Mrs. Candela, is there anyone that you know

185
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,070
<4-12,BECKETT>会计师或你们公司的人
<4-12,BECKETT>That can help you-- An accountant or maybe someone at your firm?

186
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,070
<4-13,ALFRED>妮娜能帮我们
<4-13,ALFRED>Nina could help.

187
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,570
<4-15,THERESA>-妮娜是谁  -我妹妹  她是注册会计师
<4-15,THERESA>- Nina? - My sister. She's a C.P.A.

188
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,470
<4-16,ALFRED>但是就算我们把钱给了他们
<4-16,ALFRED>But even if we give them the money,

189
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,570
<4-16,ALFRED>又怎能保证女儿能回来
<4-16,ALFRED>How can we be sure we'll get her back?

190
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,770
<4-17,SORENSON>你们要抱有希望
<4-17,SORENSON>You have to have hope.

191
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,770
<4-17,SORENSON>你们要想象女儿能安然无恙的踏入家门
<4-17,SORENSON>You have to imagine your little girl walking through that front door safe and sound.

192
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,770
<4-17,SORENSON>现在你们的女儿需要你们
<4-17,SORENSON>Your daughter needs you right now.

193
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,070
<4-17,SORENSON>需要你们充满信心  还要坚强
<4-17,SORENSON>She needs you to have faith, to be strong.

194
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,470
<5-1,CASTLE>这种案子你办的很多吗  我是说绑架案
<5-1,CASTLE>You do this a lot-- Kidnappings?

195
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,070
<5-1,CASTLE>似乎你知道说话的套路
<5-1,CASTLE>You seem to know what to say.

196
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,270
<5-2,SORENSON>说什么不重要
<5-2,SORENSON>It's not about what you say.

197
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,970
<5-2,SORENSON>重要的是控制局面  控制情绪
<5-2,SORENSON>It's about controlling the situation, controlling the emotions.

198
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,570
<5-3,CASTLE>你要求你的前女友参与此案
<5-3,CASTLE>You requested your ex-girlfriend for the task force.

199
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,570
<5-3,CASTLE>这可不像是控制情绪的表现
<5-3,CASTLE>That doesn't indicate to me a control of your emotions.

200
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,570
<5-4,SORENSON>我请贝克特来是因为她是纽约最好的警探
<5-4,SORENSON>I requested Beckett because she's the best in the city.

201
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,770
<5-5,CASTLE>不是因为你想再见她一次吗
<5-5,CASTLE>Not because you wanted to see her again?

202
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,570
<5-6,SORENSON>你呢  卡塞尔
<5-6,SORENSON>How about you, Castle?

203
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,670
<5-6,SORENSON>你已经写了  大概20本畅销书了吧
<5-6,SORENSON>You've written, what, 20 best sellers?

204
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,470
<5-7,CASTLE>26本  不过这不算什么
<5-7,CASTLE>Well, 26, but who's countin'?

205
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,970
<5-8,SORENSON>怎么想起以真警探为原型呢
<5-8,SORENSON>Why the sudden need to shadow a real detective?

206
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,970
<5-9,CASTLE>电视上戴墨镜的警察太老套了
<5-9,CASTLE>Well, the ones on tv seem oddly fixated on their sunglasses.

207
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,070
<5-10,SORENSON>从纽约警署里众多大腹便便的秃顶警察里
<5-10,SORENSON>So with all the fat, balding detectives in the NYPD,

208
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,970
<5-10,SORENSON>你就那么巧找到她这个原型
<5-10,SORENSON>You just happen to end up shadowing her.

209
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,670
<5-11,CASTLE>肯定是缘分吧
<5-11,CASTLE>It must be fate.

210
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,170
<5-12,SORENSON>应该是吧
<5-12,SORENSON>Must be.

211
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,070
<5-13,BECKETT>坎德拉夫妇列出了财务清单
<5-13,BECKETT>Candelas have pulled their financials.

212
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,670
<5-13,BECKETT>她妹妹妮娜马上就到
<5-13,BECKETT>Her sister's on the way.

213
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,670
<5-13,BECKETT>电话记录有发现吗
<5-13,BECKETT>Anything on the transcripts?

214
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,170
<5-14,SORENSON>很明显赎金要求很特别
<5-14,SORENSON>It's clear the ransom demand has significance.

215
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,970
<5-14,SORENSON>绑匪很清楚坎德拉夫妇的家底
<5-14,SORENSON>Kidnappers make an issue about knowing what the Candelas have.

216
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,970
<5-15,CASTLE>他们说这是全部的钱
<5-15,CASTLE>They said it's everything they have.

217
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,070
<5-16,SORENSON>绑匪对他们了如指掌  熟悉他们的经济状况
<5-16,SORENSON>Whoever made the demand knows them well enough to know exactly what they're worth.

218
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,870
<6-1,BECKETT>怎么样
<6-1,BECKETT>How does it look?

219
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,570
<6-2,THERESA>警探  索伦森探员  这是我妹妹妮娜
<6-2,THERESA>Detective, agent Sorenson, this is my sister Nina.

220
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,070
<6-3,NINA>可以办到  明早我们就把股票卖掉
<6-3,NINA>It's doable. We'll market the stocks tomorrow morning.

221
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,670
<6-3,NINA>还得把退休金和养老金都提出来
<6-3,NINA>We'll have to wipe out the retirement account and both pensions,

222
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,070
<6-3,NINA>这样你们就得付罚金
<6-3,NINA>And you'll have to pay penalties.

223
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,270
<6-4,THERESA>不管多大代价  我不在乎
<6-4,THERESA>I don't care. Whatever it takes.

224
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,470
<6-5,THERESA>他心情紧张的时候就画画
<6-5,THERESA>He paints when he's stressed.

225
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,770
<6-6,CASTLE>画卖的好吗
<6-6,CASTLE>Does he sell much?

226
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,070
<6-7,THERESA>卖了一些吧
<6-7,THERESA>Some.

227
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,870
<6-8,NINA>言过其实了
<6-8,NINA>That's generous.

228
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,670
<6-9,NINA>不好意思
<6-9,NINA>Sorry.

229
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,370
<6-10,THERESA>干嘛问这个
<6-10,THERESA>Why do you ask?

230
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,570
<6-11,CASTLE>据我所知有养老金的艺术家可不多
<6-11,CASTLE>I don't know many artists with their own pension account.

231
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,570
<6-12,NINA>是特丽萨替他开的户
<6-12,NINA>Theresa set up the account for him

232
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,670
<6-12,NINA>他想给自己和安吉拉留点什么
<6-12,NINA>So he'd have something for him and Angela, you know,

233
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,070
<6-13,CASTLE>-以防万一  -想问问
<6-13,CASTLE>- If something-- - Tell me--

234
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,170
<6-13,CASTLE>坎德拉太太
<6-13,CASTLE>Mrs. Candela,

235
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,970
<6-14,SORENSON>我们认为赎金的具体数目
<6-14,SORENSON>We think the specificity of the amount of the ransom demand

236
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,670
<6-14,SORENSON>说明了绑匪很了解你们的财务状况
<6-14,SORENSON>Suggests the kidnappers had knowledge of your finances.

237
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,070
<6-15,BECKETT>你们有没有跟人结仇
<6-15,BECKETT>Was there anyone who might've had a grudge against you

238
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,470
<6-15,BECKETT>或者身边有人最近缺钱呢
<6-15,BECKETT>Or maybe someone close to you who need the money now?

239
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,470
<6-16,THERESA>不会有人做这种事
<6-16,THERESA>No one who would do something like this.

240
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,070
<6-17,ALFRED>道格·艾勒斯会不会呢
<6-17,ALFRED>What about Doug Ellers?

<6-18,BECKETT>谁是道格·艾勒斯
<6-18,BECKETT>Who's Doug ellers?

242
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,570
<6-19,THERESA>以前的同事  可我想不出来...
<6-19,THERESA>Someone I used to work with, but no, I can't imagine--

243
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,470
<6-20,ALFRED>那他临走时对你说的那些话
<6-20,ALFRED>What about those messages he left you at work?

244
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,170
<6-20,ALFRED>记得吗  你还向人力资源部反应过
<6-20,ALFRED>Remember, you filed those complaints with H.R.?

247
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,970
<6-22,SORENSON>你难受我也理解
<6-22,SORENSON>It's understandable to get frustrated.

248
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,570
<6-22,SORENSON>不过我们需要了解所有情况
<6-22,SORENSON>But please, we need to know everything.

<6-23,THERESA>They weren't performing, so I let him go.

251

<6-24,SORENSON>他威胁过你吗
<6-24,SORENSON>Did he ever threaten you?

252

<6-25,THERESA>他把婚姻破裂怪在我头上
<6-25,THERESA>Well, he blamed me for his divorce.

253
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,370
<6-25,THERESA>他说我炒了他  所以妻子抛弃了他  而且
<6-25,THERESA>He said his wife left him because I fired him, and...

254
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,470

<7-17,SORENSON>You left that three months ago,

287
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,670
<7-17,SORENSON>你太太刚离开的时候
<7-17,SORENSON>Just after your wife left.

<7-22,ELLERS>What the hell are you talking about?

294
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,470
<7-23,BECKETT>今早安吉拉·坎德拉被绑架了
<7-23,BECKETT>Somebody kidnapped Angela Candela this morning.

295
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,870
<7-24,ELLERS>什么  绑架
<7-24,ELLERS>What? Kidnapped?

296
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,770
<7-25,SORENSON>伤害别人的孩子
<7-25,SORENSON>Hurting someone else's child

297
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,970
<7-25,SORENSON>并不能追回失去的东西
<7-25,SORENSON>isn't the way to get back your own.

298
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,970
<7-26,ELLERS>不  不  不  这种事我不干
<7-26,ELLERS>No, no, no. This is not me.

299
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,870
<7-26,ELLERS>虽然不待见特丽萨
<7-26,ELLERS>Theresa may not be my favorite person,

300
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,970
<7-26,ELLERS>可我绝不会去伤害一个孩子
<7-26,ELLERS>But I would never harm a child.

301
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,170
<7-27,BECKETT>你前妻大概不会这么想
<7-27,BECKETT>Your ex-Wife wasn't so sure.

302
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,170
<7-27,BECKETT>离婚判决书上对你提出
<7-27,BECKETT>According to your divorce papers,

303
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,170
<7-27,BECKETT>暴力指控...
<7-27,BECKETT>there are allegations of violence--

304
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,170
<7-28,ELLERS>我前妻不过是想要钱  就这样
<7-28,ELLERS>My ex-Wife was looking for a payday. That's all.

305
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,370
<7-29,SORENSON>你也是想要钱  对吗  艾勒斯先生
<7-29,SORENSON>You're not looking for a payday, are you, Mr. Ellers?

306
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,870
<7-30,ELLERS>你们抓错人了
<7-30,ELLERS>You have the wrong guy.

307
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,970
<8-1,SORENSON>查查他  早上在哪儿  有没有证人
<8-1,SORENSON>Run him down-- Where he was all morning, who can vouch.

308
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,570
<8-2,CASTLE>明显不是他
<8-2,CASTLE>Pretty clear it wasn't him.

309
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,070
<8-3,SORENSON>你还会读心术啊
<8-3,SORENSON>You a mind reader, too?

310
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,370
<8-4,CASTLE>得了吧  如果是他
<8-4,CASTLE>Come on, if he was your guy,

311
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,070
<8-4,CASTLE>他会掩饰对特丽萨的厌恶
<8-4,CASTLE>He'd be downplaying his feelings for Theresa,

312
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,170
<8-4,CASTLE>而不会这么外露
<8-4,CASTLE>Not wearing them on his sleeve.

313
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,270
<8-5,SORENSON>写几本畅销书不代表你成了犯罪学家
<8-5,SORENSON>Couple dozen best sellers doesn't make you a criminologist.

314
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,870
<8-6,CASTLE>那也不用气象学家告诉我天是蓝色的
<8-6,CASTLE>I also don't need a weatherman to tell me that the sky is blue.

315
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,070
<8-6,CASTLE>看在上帝的份上

316
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,870
<8-7,BECKETT>你俩就不能屏弃前嫌吗
<8-7,BECKETT>Why don't you both just drop your pants and get it over with?

317
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,070
<8-8,CASTLE>我同意
<8-8,CASTLE>I'm game.

318
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,870
<8-9,BECKETT>其实你俩都对  或许不是他
<8-9,BECKETT>The fact is, you're both right. He probably didn't do it.

319
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,570
<8-9,BECKETT>可现在孩子危在旦夕  必须要查清楚
<8-9,BECKETT>But when a child's life is at stake, we have to be sure.

320
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,170
<8-9,BECKETT>我们必须查证我们想当然的事
<8-9,BECKETT>We have to question everything we think we know.

<9-18,CASTLE>难道还要挤占我的办公室
<9-18,CASTLE>Do you have to commandeer my office

367
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,500
<9-18,CASTLE>搞你这套知心大姐游戏吗
<9-18,CASTLE>To do your new age coddle session?

368
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,800
<9-19,MARTHA>理查德  你该不会想让我
<9-19,MARTHA>Richard, you can't expect me

369

<9-20,CASTLE>Proximity to beverages and sharp utensils.

373
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,700
<9-21,MARTHA>宝贝  作为你的生活导师

<9-21,MARTHA>I have to urge you to say nay to your inner naysayer.

375
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
<9-21,MARTHA>我管这叫玛莎主义
<9-21,MARTHA>I call that a Martha-Ism.

376
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
<9-22,CASTLE>你连我父亲是谁都没清楚
<9-22,CASTLE>How is it that you don't know who my father is,

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,100
<9-22,CASTLE>也没搞清前夫如何偷光你的钱
<9-22,CASTLE>You don't know how your ex-Husband stole all your money,

378
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,730
<9-22,CASTLE>怎么指导别人的生活呢
<9-22,CASTLE>Yet you are giving life coaching advice?

379
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,500
<9-23,MARTHA>失败乃成功之母
<9-23,MARTHA>Mistakes are the building blocks of wisdom.

380
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,090
<9-23,MARTHA>这也是玛莎主义
<9-23,MARTHA>A Martha-Ism.

381
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,700
<9-23,MARTHA>更何况  弗洛伊德虽然是个瘾君子
<9-23,MARTHA>Besides, Freud was an addict.

382
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
<9-23,MARTHA>也没耽误他帮助别人
<9-23,MARTHA>Didn't stop him from helping people.

383
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,300
<9-24,CASTLE>可惜的是  听了妈妈
<9-24,CASTLE>Sadly, faced with his mother's...

384
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
<9-24,CASTLE>无懈可击的狡辩
<9-24,CASTLE>Twisted yet unimpeachable logic,

385
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,000
<9-24,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔脑袋炸了
<9-24,CASTLE>Richard Castle' s head exploded.

<9-25,MARTHA>是嘛
<9-25,MARTHA>Ah, well.

387
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,700
<9-25,MARTHA>怎么今天回家这么早
<9-25,MARTHA>So why are you home so early?

388
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,500
<9-26,CASTLE>主要是想歇一歇
<9-26,CASTLE>Well, thought I'd take a little breather.

389
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,600
<9-26,CASTLE>正在忙一个绑架案
<9-26,CASTLE>Working on a, uh, kidnapping case.

390
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
<9-26,CASTLE>一个小姑娘被绑了
<9-26,CASTLE>A little girl.

391
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,500
<9-27,MARTHA>难怪你板着个脸
<9-27,MARTHA>No wonder you're so surly.

392
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,400
<9-27,MARTHA>可怜的家长  自己的孩子被人抢走
<9-27,MARTHA>Those poor parents, having a child ripped away...

393
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,100
<9-27,MARTHA>真没法想象他们的感受
<9-27,MARTHA>I can't imagine how they must feel.

394
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,500
<9-28,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯在家吗
<9-28,CASTLE>Is Alexis home?

395
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
<9-29,MARTHA>在楼上呢
<9-29,MARTHA>She's upstairs.

396
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
<9-30,CASTLE>我迫切需要一个拥抱
<9-30,CASTLE>I'm feeling a deep-Seated need for a hug.

<9-31,MARTHA>完全理解
<9-31,MARTHA>Perfectly understandable.

398
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,100
<9-31,MARTHA>毕竟  我们都是豆荚里的豆子
<9-31,MARTHA>After all, we are pod-Mates.

399
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
<9-31,MARTHA>也是玛莎主义  我称之为豆荚纽带
<9-31,MARTHA>Another martha-Ism. I call it the peapod bond--

400
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,000
<9-31,MARTHA>就是那种父母跟孩子之间的纽带
<9-31,MARTHA>You know, the bond that exists between parent and child--

401
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,900
<9-31,MARTHA>你和我  你和阿丽克西斯

<9-31,MARTHA>只要有孩子  就是豆荚里的豆子
<9-31,MARTHA>Everyone who's ever had a child is in the pod forever.

<9-36,CASTLE>I'll deduct my session fee from your rent.

407
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
<9-37,MARTHA>或许你应该考虑订购全年课程
<9-37,MARTHA>You might want to consider the year-long package.

408
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,400
<9-37,MARTHA>价钱好商量
<9-37,MARTHA>It's a bargain!

410
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,000
<9-39,CASTLE>只是豆荚问题
<9-39,CASTLE>Just a peapod thing.

411
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,500
<9-39,CASTLE>让奶奶解释会给你听
<9-39,CASTLE>Gram will explain.

<10-4,BECKETT>艾勒斯那边没得可查了
<10-4,BECKETT>And Ellers is a dead end.

417
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,700
<10-4,BECKETT>第62东大街天国餐厅的老板证实了
<10-4,BECKETT>The owner over at Paradise Diner on East 62nd vouched

418
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,400
<10-4,BECKETT>他今早照常在他店里吃荷包蛋
<10-4,BECKETT>That he was having his usual poached eggs this morning.

419
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
<10-5,SORENSON>也太简单了  是吧
<10-5,SORENSON>Would have been too easy, right?

420
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
<10-5,SORENSON>或者说  过于简单
<10-5,SORENSON>Or over easy?

421
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
<10-6,BECKETT>听起来像卡塞尔的语气
<10-6,BECKETT>That's like something Castle would say.

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,400
<10-8,BECKETT>不  我只是...
<10-8,BECKETT>No, I just, um...

424
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,900
<10-8,BECKETT>说不好
<10-8,BECKETT>I don't know.

425
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,800
<10-8,BECKETT>我觉得他很有趣
<10-8,BECKETT>I think he's interesting.

426
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,700
<10-9,SORENSON>看来你们还没..
<10-9,SORENSON>So you're not...

427
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,100
<10-10,BECKETT>走到一起吗  没有
<10-10,BECKETT>Together? No.

428
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,300
<10-11,SORENSON>我本想给你打电话
<10-11,SORENSON>I meant to call.

429
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,500
<10-11,SORENSON>几十次电话都拿起来了
<10-11,SORENSON>Must have picked up the phone a dozen times.

430
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,700
<10-12,BECKETT>我明白  你本想做很多事
<10-12,BECKETT>Yeah, I know. You meant to do a lot of things.

431
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,500
<10-12,BECKETT>所以就走了  记得吗
<10-12,BECKETT>That's why you left, remember?

432
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,700
<10-13,SORENSON>当时波士顿那里对我来说机会难得
<10-13,SORENSON>Boston was a great opportunity.

433
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,000
<10-14,BECKETT>我没否认
<10-14,BECKETT>I'm not saying that it wasn't.

434
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
<10-14,BECKETT>我只是说  你当时做出了选择
<10-14,BECKETT>I'm just saying, it was a choice...

435
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
<10-14,BECKETT>而我并非你的选择
<10-14,BECKETT>That didn't include me.

436
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,900
<10-15,SORENSON>你本可以一起去
<10-15,SORENSON>You could have come.

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,200
<10-16,BECKETT>去了干什么呢
<10-16,BECKETT>And then done what?

438
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,400
<10-16,BECKETT>去波士顿当警察  然后你又搬到凤凰城
<10-16,BECKETT>Join the Boston P.D., and then you have to move to Phoenix

439
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
<10-16,BECKETT>然后克里夫兰  然后又回到这儿吗
<10-16,BECKETT>And then Cleveland, and then you're back here?

440
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,400
<10-16,BECKETT>我是说  你我都清楚那是什么样的日子
<10-16,BECKETT>I mean, we both know what that life is all about.

441
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,200
<10-17,SORENSON>可这样我也一直想你
<10-17,SORENSON>Didn't stop me from missing you,

442
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,500
<10-17,SORENSON>想我们
<10-17,SORENSON>Missing us.

443
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,200
<10-17,SORENSON>公园里度过的那些星期天
<10-17,SORENSON>Sundays in the park...

444
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:48,200
<10-17,SORENSON>还有洛克菲勒中心滑稽的溜冰鞋
<10-17,SORENSON>Those ridiculous neon ice skates at Rockefeller Center.

445
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,400
<10-18,BECKETT>我跟你说  那些溜冰鞋很棒的
<10-18,BECKETT>I will have you know that those ice skates are awesome.

446
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,500
<10-19,SORENSON>冰鞋并不是重点
<10-19,SORENSON>It wasn't the skates.

447
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
<10-20,BECKETT>威尔  我
<10-20,BECKETT>Will, I--I'm...

448
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,300
<10-21,CASTLE>我还以为警察和特工不共戴天呢
<10-21,CASTLE>Oh! I thought cops and feds hated each other.

449
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,100
<10-22,CASTLE>人说正义永不灭  我想我知道原因了
<10-22,CASTLE>They say justice never sleeps. I think I know why.

450
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
<10-23,BECKETT>-我们只是  -大家都是成年人
<10-23,BECKETT>- We were just, uh-- - Being consenting adults.

451
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
<10-24,CASTLE>我无意评判
<10-24,CASTLE>I'm not judging.

452
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,900
<10-25,BECKETT>我记得让你回家了呀
<10-25,BECKETT>I thought I told you to go home.

453
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
<10-26,CASTLE>我确实回家了
<10-26,CASTLE>I did go home,

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,900
<10-26,CASTLE>不过我母亲提醒了我一件要紧的事
<10-26,CASTLE>But then my mother told me something that couldn't wait.

455
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
<10-27,SORENSON>你和你妈一起住
<10-27,SORENSON>You live with your mother?

456
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,300
<10-28,CASTLE>没错  很明显我们都是豆荚里的豆子
<10-28,CASTLE>Yeah, apparently, we're peas in a pod.

457
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
<10-28,CASTLE>重点是  安吉拉是收养的
<10-28,CASTLE>But the important point is, Angela is adopted.

458
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,400
<10-29,BECKETT>所以呢
<10-29,BECKETT>So?

459
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,300
<10-30,CASTLE>所以在送出孩子之前
<10-30,CASTLE>So prior to giving up her baby,

460
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,000
<10-30,CASTLE>生母是要了解收养家庭的情况
<10-30,CASTLE>The birth mother would have been given background on the Candelas,

461
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,900
<10-30,CASTLE>尤其是抚养能力
<10-30,CASTLE>Specifically their ability to support the child.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,800
<10-31,BECKETT>你是指财政情况
<10-31,BECKETT>Knowledge of their finances.

463
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
<10-32,SORENSON>实话说  凯特
<10-32,SORENSON>Really, Kate,

464
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
<10-32,SORENSON>我们还得费时听南希·珠尔[电影《少女神探》主角]的意见吗
<10-32,SORENSON>We're gonna waste time on the insights of Nancy Drew here?

465
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,200
<10-33,CASTLE>这算侮辱吗
<10-33,CASTLE>Is that supposed to be an insult?

466
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,900
<10-33,CASTLE>南希·珠尔可是破了所有的案件
<10-33,CASTLE>Because Nancy Drew solved every case.

467
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,700
<10-33,CASTLE>听着  我来引用一下这句话
<10-33,CASTLE>Look, okay, and I'm quoting here,

468
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,110
<10-33,CASTLE>孩子危在旦夕时
<10-33,CASTLE>"When a child's life is at stake,

469
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,800
<10-33,CASTLE>必须要查清楚
<10-33,CASTLE>We have to be sure,

470
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,400
<10-33,CASTLE>我们必须查证我们想当然的事
<10-33,CASTLE>Which means we have to question everything we think we know."

471
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,200
<11-1,LUCIA>我当时在上高中
<11-1,LUCIA>I was a junior in high school.

472
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,100
<11-1,LUCIA>能拿孩子怎么办呢
<11-1,LUCIA>What was I gonna do with a baby?

473
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,700
<11-2,SORENSON>已经过去两年了  戈麦斯小姐
<11-2,SORENSON>It's been two years, Miss Gomez.

474
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,700
<11-2,SORENSON>两年的时间足够让你
<11-2,SORENSON>Two years is still a long time

475
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,000
<11-2,SORENSON>好好反思自己16岁时做的决定了
<11-2,SORENSON>To think about a decision you made when you were 16.

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
<11-3,LUCIA>你们找我来干什么  要谈什么呀
<11-3,LUCIA>What am I doing here? What is this about?

477
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,850
<11-4,BECKETT>我们要谈谈你的孩子
<11-4,BECKETT>We're talking about the baby

478
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,400
<11-4,BECKETT>还有你把孩子送人之后的悔意
<11-4,BECKETT>and your regretting your decision.

479
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,900
<11-5,LUCIA>悔意
<11-5,LUCIA>My decision?

480
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,500
<11-5,LUCIA>我没有后悔过
<11-5,LUCIA>I don't regret my decision.

481
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,600
<11-6,SORENSON>那你为什么还想找她
<11-6,SORENSON>Then why did you try to find her?

482
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,500
<11-7,LUCIA>你在说什么啊
<11-7,LUCIA>What are you talking about?

483
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,200
<11-8,BECKETT>这是数月前你在领养机构填写的申请书
<11-8,BECKETT>This is a petition that you filed with the adoption agency a couple of months ago.

484
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,700
<11-9,BECKETT>要求了解安吉拉的养父母
<11-9,BECKETT>It's a form requesting the identity of the adoptive parents of Angela.

485
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,200
<11-10,SORENSON>-有你的签名  -我没签过
<11-10,SORENSON>- A signed form. - No.

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
<11-11,LUCIA>-那不是我签的  -露西娅  我不是
<11-11,LUCIA>- That's not my signature. - Lucia, I'm not--

487
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,900
<11-11,LUCIA>真的不是  给  你自己看
<11-11,LUCIA>No, really. Look, you can see for yourself.

488
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
<11-11,LUCIA>那不是我的签名
<11-11,LUCIA>That's not my signature.

489
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
<11-13,LUCIA>怎么了  出什么事了吗
<11-13,LUCIA>Why? What's going on?

490
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,600
<11-14,LUCIA>她怎么了
<11-14,LUCIA>What happened to her?

491
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
<11-14,LUCIA>她还好吗
<11-14,LUCIA>Is she okay?

492
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,900
<11-15,BECKETT>你家里有人反对放弃这个孩子吗
<11-15,BECKETT>Did anyone in your family object to you giving up your baby?

493
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,000
<11-16,LUCIA>没有  我妈妈还一直帮我
<11-16,LUCIA>No, no one. My-- My mom even helped me with it.

494
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,300
<11-17,SORENSON>孩子的生父吗
<11-17,SORENSON>And the father?

495
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,600
<12-1,BECKETT>胡安
<12-1,BECKETT>Juan?

496
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
<11-18,LUCIA>我怀孕时他在伊拉克
<11-18,LUCIA>He was in Iraq when I had her,

497
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,400
<11-18,LUCIA>但我们谈过的
<11-18,LUCIA>But we talked about it.

498
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,500
<11-18,LUCIA>他没什么意见
<11-18,LUCIA>He was cool.

499
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,300
<11-19,BECKETT>你确定吗
<11-19,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

500
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
<11-20,SORENSON>他还在伊拉克吗
<11-20,SORENSON>He still in iraq?

501
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,100
<11-21,LUCIA>不  几个月前回来了
<11-21,LUCIA>No, he got back a couple months ago.

502
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,300
<12-1,BECKETT>胡安·雷斯特雷波
<12-1,BECKETT>Juan Restrepo?

503
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,400
<12-2,BECKETT>纽约警局  我们想问你一些...
<12-2,BECKETT>NYPD. We'd like to ask you some--

<12-6,RYAN>On the ground. On the ground!

509
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,400
<12-6,RYAN>趴下
<12-6,RYAN>Hit the ground!

510
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
<13-2,JUAN>住在我们那里的人
<13-2,JUAN>Look, in my neighborhood,

511
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,120
<13-2,JUAN>看见警察都这种反应
<13-2,JUAN>When you see a cop, that's what you do.

512
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,020
<13-3,CASTLE>怎么  好警察还是烂特工
<13-3,CASTLE>What? No, uh, good cop/bad fed?

513
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,020
<13-4,SORENSON>那家伙曾在海湾地区服役两届
<13-4,SORENSON>The guy did two tours in the Gulf.

514
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,820
<13-4,SORENSON>我过去会惹火他的
<13-4,SORENSON>I go over there, he'd turn it into a pissing match.

515
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,820
<13-4,SORENSON>但是凯特却懂得接近别人
<13-4,SORENSON>But Kate, she's got a way of sneaking up on people.

516
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,520
<13-5,CASTLE>你是说就像昨晚一样吗
<13-5,CASTLE>You mean like last night?

517
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,920
<13-6,RYAN>难以置信
<13-6,RYAN>Can you believe this?

518
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,720
<13-6,RYAN>那家伙以车内装饰为生
<13-6,RYAN>Dude details cars for a living.

519
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,020
<13-6,RYAN>我还以为他会把自己的车好好收拾下
<13-6,RYAN>You'd think he'd have a little more pride in his ride.

520
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,920
<13-7,CASTLE>我只是想说
<13-7,CASTLE>I'm just saying,

521
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,820
<13-7,CASTLE>吻得够深情的
<13-7,CASTLE>It looked like quite a kiss.

522
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,120
<13-8,SORENSON>-卡塞尔  吃醋了  -我
<13-8,SORENSON>- You jealous, Castle? - Me?

523
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,420
<13-9,CASTLE>没有  但是你不得不承认  我正中要害
<13-9,CASTLE>No, but you have to admit... I was right.

524
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
<13-10,SORENSON>你就是在吃醋  因为我勾引她
<13-10,SORENSON>You are jealous... That I hooked her.

525
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,520
<13-11,CASTLE>有什么好吃醋的  你又搞不定她
<13-11,CASTLE>What's there to be jealous of? You couldn't reel her in.

526
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,820
<13-12,SORENSON>我们走着瞧
<13-12,SORENSON>We'll see about that.

527
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,520
<13-13,JUAN>露西娅怀孕时  我只有18岁
<13-13,JUAN>I was 18 when Lucia got pregnant.

528
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,720
<13-13,JUAN>六个月之后我被调走了
<13-13,JUAN>Six months in, I got deployed.

529
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,120
<13-13,JUAN>再也没机会见她
<13-13,JUAN>I never even had the chance to see her.

530
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,820
<13-14,BECKETT>但你签了那请愿书
<13-14,BECKETT>But you signed the adoption papers.

531
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,820
<13-15,JUAN>在那边我见到了很多孩子
<13-15,JUAN>You know, when you're over there, you see so many kids.

532
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,520
<13-15,JUAN>我只是
<13-15,JUAN>I just...

533
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,740
<13-15,JUAN>只是想知道孩子过得很好
<13-15,JUAN>I need to know she was okay.

534
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,720
<13-15,JUAN>我就用露西娅的名字填了表
<13-15,JUAN>I- I filled out the form, and I put Lucia's name instead.

535
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,070
<13-16,BECKETT>-地址给你了  -对  那人同情我
<13-16,BECKETT>- You got an address. - Yeah, dude felt bad for me.

536
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,220
<13-17,JUAN>他参加了第一次海湾战争
<13-17,JUAN>He was over there, too, in Gulf One,

537
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
<13-17,JUAN>而且他只失去了一条胳膊
<13-17,JUAN>And he only lost an arm.

538
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,720
<13-18,BECKETT>你失去了什么
<13-18,BECKETT>And what did you lose?

539
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
<13-19,JUAN>土炸弹炸了我的输送车
<13-19,JUAN>An I.E.D. Hit my humvee.

540
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,220
<13-19,JUAN>炸飞了车的底板
<13-19,JUAN>The shrapnel tore through the floor.

541
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,520
<13-19,JUAN>医生说这辈子我不可能有自己的孩子了
<13-19,JUAN>The doc says I'm never gonna have kids of my own,

542
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,820
<13-19,JUAN>所以
<13-19,JUAN>So...

543
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,720
<13-19,JUAN>是的  我是有地址  还去看了我女儿
<13-19,JUAN>Yeah, I got an address, and I went to go see my daughter.

544
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,620
<13-20,BECKETT>然后你就绑架她  还向她养父母索要赎金
<13-20,BECKETT>So you kidnap her and you ask her adoptive parents for money?

545
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,220
<13-21,JUAN>等等  绑架  她被绑架了吗
<13-21,JUAN>Wait, "kidnap her"? She was kidnapped?

546
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,820
<13-21,JUAN>你觉得我会干出这种事
<13-21,JUAN>And you think I did that?

547
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,120
<13-21,JUAN>我只是想知道她过得好不好
<13-21,JUAN>All I ever wanted to know was that she was okay!

548
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,820
<13-21,JUAN>她还好吗
<13-21,JUAN>Is she?!

549
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,320
<14-1,ESPOSITO>生父的话核实过了
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Yo. Birth dad? His story checks out.

550
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,720
<14-1,ESPOSITO>豪华轿车公司昨天让他去装饰车队了
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Limo Company had him doing their fleet yesterday.

551
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,420
<14-2,SORENSON>我不管  他既有动机又有机会
<14-2,SORENSON>I don't care. He had motive and opportunity.

552
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,420
<14-3,CASTLE>他的动机就是父亲的本能
<14-3,CASTLE>His motive was the instinct of fatherhood.

553
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,720
<14-3,CASTLE>要是真是他干的  他会一直陪着她的
<14-3,CASTLE>If he took her, he'd have been with her,

554
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,520
<14-3,CASTLE>而不是去干他那薪水卑微的工作
<14-3,CASTLE>Not at some $12-An-Hour detailing job.

555
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,120
<14-3,CASTLE>那不重要
<14-3,CASTLE>Doesn't matter.

556
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,520
<14-4,SORENSON>我要让鉴证科彻底搜查他的房子
<14-4,SORENSON>I want E.S.U. On his place.

557
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
<14-5,BECKETT>不是他干的  威尔
<14-5,BECKETT>It's not him, Will.

558
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,870
<14-5,BECKETT>我们折腾半天  一无所获
<14-5,BECKETT>We're at square freakin' one, and we've got nothing.

559
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,990
<14-5,BECKETT>你可以让鉴证科去任何地方
<14-5,BECKETT>You can send E.S.U. wherever you want,

560
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,360
<14-6,CASTLE>但这次我不想办砸
<14-6,CASTLE>But I'm not losing this one.

561
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,420
<14-6,CASTLE>她为什么说"不想办砸"
<14-6,CASTLE>What did she mean, "not losing this one"?

562
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,720
<14-7,SORENSON>我们上次的案子
<14-7,SORENSON>The case we worked.

563
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,720
<14-8,CASTLE>凶手不是抓到了吗
<14-8,CASTLE>I thought you got the guy.

564
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,620
<14-9,SORENSON>是抓到了  不过
<14-9,SORENSON>We did, but...

565
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,920
<14-9,SORENSON>孩子死了
<14-9,SORENSON>The kid was already dead.

566
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,620
<14-9,SORENSON>我是索伦森
<14-9,SORENSON>Sorenson.

567
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,120
<14-10,SORENSON>马上就到
<14-10,SORENSON>On my way.

568
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,920
<14-11,SORENSON>绑匪又打电话要赎金了
<14-11,SORENSON>Another call about the ransom.

569
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,320
<15-1,FBI TECH>他们要75捆百元现钞
<15-1,FBI TECH>They asked for 75 packs of hundreds,

570
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,420
<15-1,FBI TECH>不能连号  不能是饵钱
<15-1,FBI TECH>Randomized serial numbers and warned against bait money,

571
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,020
<15-1,FBI TECH>不能带防盗染色包或追踪器
<15-1,FBI TECH>Dye packs and trackers.

572
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,320
<15-2,CASTLE>好像很清楚你们的办案手法
<15-2,CASTLE>Sounds like they know your playbook.

573
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,020
<15-3,FBI TECH>他们对包的样式和颜色
<15-3,FBI TECH>They were detailed down to the make,

574
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,320
<15-3,FBI TECH>要求的很具体
<15-3,FBI TECH>Model and color of the backpack.

575
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,420
<15-4,BECKETT>送钱的指令呢
<15-4,BECKETT>Drop instructions?

576
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,720
<15-5,FBI TECH>还在等电话
<15-5,FBI TECH>We wait for their call.

577
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,220
<15-6,SORENSON>好吧  我们把钱整好
<15-6,SORENSON>All right, let's get the money set,

578
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,720
<15-6,SORENSON>准备交赎金
<15-6,SORENSON>Be ready to make the drop.

579
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,220
<15-7,ALFRED>他们为什么没说钱送到哪里
<15-7,ALFRED>Why didn't they tell us where to bring the money?

580
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,320
<15-8,BECKETT>他们在试探  这很正常
<15-8,BECKETT>They're testing you. It's not unusual.

581
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,020
<15-9,SORENSON>这就意味着交赎金前
<15-9,SORENSON>Which means before we make the drop,

582
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,620
<15-9,SORENSON>我们也得试探一下他们
<15-9,SORENSON>We'll need to test them.

583
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,020
<15-9,SORENSON>证实安吉拉确实在他们手上并且毫发无伤
<15-9,SORENSON>We'll need proof that they have Angela and that she's okay.

584
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
<15-10,ALFRED>他们要是不配合呢
<15-10,ALFRED>What if they don't give any?

585
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,220
<15-11,THERESA>-他们拒绝怎么办  -你怎么能这么想
<15-11,THERESA>- What if they refuse? - How can you think that?

586
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,420
<15-13,THERESA>-我只是说  -什么  你觉得她死了吗
<15-13,THERESA>- I'm just saying-- - What, you think she's dead?

587
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,520
<15-14,ALFRED>-不  当然不是  -我应该起床的
<15-14,ALFRED>- No, of course not. - I should've gotten up.

588
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,020
<15-15,THERESA>不该让你来照看她
<15-15,THERESA>I shouldn't have let you watch her.

589
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,920
<15-16,ALFRED>别告诉我你想说什么
<15-16,ALFRED>Don't tell me what to say!

590
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,320
<15-17,THERESA>你看看  阿尔弗雷德  就为了这玩意
<15-17,THERESA>Tell me, Alfred, was it worth it?!

591
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,920
<15-18,THERESA>这破画顶的上我们的女儿吗
<15-18,THERESA>Was it worth our little girl?!

592
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,920
<15-18,THERESA>我  我的
<15-18,THERESA>Oh! Oh, my...

593
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,120
<15-18,THERESA>坎德拉太太
<15-18,THERESA>Mrs. Candela?

594
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
<15-19,BECKETT>泰丽莎
<15-19,BECKETT>Theresa...

595
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,720
<15-19,BECKETT>你不能向恐惧屈服
<15-19,BECKETT>You can't give in to your fear.

596
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,020
<15-19,BECKETT>你和你丈夫都没错
<15-19,BECKETT>Neither you nor your husband is responsible for what happened.

597
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,420
<15-20,BECKETT>来吧
<15-20,BECKETT>Come on.

598
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,420
<15-21,SORENSON>记住了  没有证据就不给钱  我们得明确这个
<15-21,SORENSON>Remember, no proof, no money. We need to be firm on that.

599
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,020
<15-22,SORENSON>好了吗  接电话
<15-22,SORENSON>Okay? Here we go.

600
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,920
<15-23,THERESA>喂
<15-23,THERESA>Hello.

<15-24,SCRAMBLED VOICE>听好了
<15-24,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Listen carefully.

602
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,120
<15-24,SCRAMBLED VOICE>出任何差错  你女儿就死定了
<15-24,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Any deviation, and your daughter dies.

603
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,820
<15-25,THERESA>我明白
<15-25,THERESA>I understand.

604
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,720
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>送钱的人不能是警察  把钱放下就走
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>A civilian, not a cop, must make the drop,

605
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,220
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>不然我们就撕票
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Or we kill the girl.

606
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,530
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>有警察或者联调局的人
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>We see police or FBI,

607
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,320
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>她就死定了
<15-26,SCRAMBLED VOICE>And she dies.

608
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,760
<15-27,THERESA>钱准备好了吗
<15-27,THERESA>Do you have the money?

609
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,020
<15-27,THERESA>好了  按你说的  75万
<15-27,THERESA>Yes. 750, like you said.

610
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,520
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>放在背包里
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Put it in the backpack

611
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,050
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>一号大街和四十七号大街之间
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>And bring it to the northeast corner

612
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,220
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>路口的东北角
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>of 1st avenue and 47th.

613
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,170
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>那有一个邮筒
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>There's a mailbox there

614
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,320
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>下面粘着手机
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>With a cell phone taped underneath.

615
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,020
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>你到了我们再发信息告诉你下一步
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>We'll text further instructions once you're there.

616
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,320
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>拿到钱以后
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>When we have the money,

617
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,720
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>我们会打电话告诉你孩子在哪里
<15-28,SCRAMBLED VOICE>Then we'll call with the girl's location.

618
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,220
<15-29,BECKETT>叫他证明安吉拉没事
<15-29,BECKETT>Ask for proof that Angela's okay.

619
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,520
<15-30,THERESA>我得确定我女儿没事再给你们钱
<15-30,THERESA>You won't get any money until I know my little girl is okay.

620
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,920
<15-30,THERESA>妈妈
<15-30,THERESA>Mama?

621
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,890
<15-31,THERESA>宝贝
<15-31,THERESA>Hi, sweetheart.

622
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,220
<15-32,SCRAMBLED VOICE>给你一小时
<15-32,SCRAMBLED VOICE>You have one hour.

623
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,020
<16-1,SORENSON>他们拿到钱就不会留活口了
<16-1,SORENSON>Once they get paid, there's no incentive to keep her alive,

624
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,520
<16-1,SORENSON>我去交赎金
<16-1,SORENSON>So I'll make the drop.

625
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,470
<16-1,SORENSON>我们会在邮箱周围一个街区内
<16-1,SORENSON>Figure, we'll place our people

626
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,320
<16-1,SORENSON>部署警员
<16-1,SORENSON>at a 1-Block radius from the mailbox.

627
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,420
<16-2,ALFRED>不行
<16-2,ALFRED>No.

628
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,820
<16-2,ALFRED>他们说了警察不能去
<16-2,ALFRED>They said no cops.

629
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,220
<16-3,SORENSON>没事的  我以前干过
<16-3,SORENSON>It's okay. I've done this before.

630
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,720
<16-3,SORENSON>他们不会发现我是联调局的探员
<16-3,SORENSON>And they won't know I'm an FBI agent.

631
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,220
<16-4,ALFRED>发现了怎么办
<16-4,ALFRED>And if they do?

632
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,220
<16-5,BECKETT>坎德拉先生  我们得确保一切顺利
<16-5,BECKETT>Mr. Candela, we need this to go as smoothly as possible.

633
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,820
<16-5,BECKETT>她是我女儿
<16-5,BECKETT>She's my daughter,

634
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,320
<16-6,ALFRED>所以我们得按他们说的办
<16-6,ALFRED>And we're gonna follow their instructions to the letter.

635
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,420
<16-6,ALFRED>他们说了不要警察
<16-6,ALFRED>They said no cops.

636
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,420
<16-6,ALFRED>听着  我是她爸爸
<16-6,ALFRED>Look, I'm her father,

637
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
<16-6,ALFRED>所以我一定可以的
<16-6,ALFRED>And I can do this.

638
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,620
<16-6,ALFRED>听清楚了吗
<16-6,ALFRED>Do I make myself clear?

639
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,120
<16-7,SORENSON>我们不能派他去
<16-7,SORENSON>No way we can send the father.

640
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,320
<16-7,SORENSON>他太激动了  会出乱子的
<16-7,SORENSON>Too many things could go wrong. He's too emotional.

641
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,820
<16-8,BECKETT>还有别的选择吗
<16-8,BECKETT>What choice do we have?

642
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,920
<16-10,BECKETT>-我  -什么
<16-10,BECKETT>- Me. - What?

643
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,820
<16-11,CASTLE>我不是警察
<16-11,CASTLE>I'm not a cop.

644
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,020
<16-11,CASTLE>当然也不那么激动
<16-11,CASTLE>I'm certainly not emotional.

645
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,520
<16-12,SORENSON>不  绝对不行
<16-12,SORENSON>No. Absolutely not.

646
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,720
<16-13,CASTLE>纽约警察局已经跟我签了免责协议
<16-13,CASTLE>The NYPD already has a signed waiver from me,

647
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,120
<16-13,CASTLE>我不想提这个
<16-13,CASTLE>And I don't like saying this,

648
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,320
<16-13,CASTLE>不过我们已经没时间了
<16-13,CASTLE>But you're running out of time.

649
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
<16-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔说的没错
<16-14,BECKETT>Castle's right.

650
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,720
<16-15,SORENSON>你不是认真的吧
<16-15,SORENSON>You can't be serious.

651
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
<16-16,BECKETT>他之前和我一起办过案
<16-16,BECKETT>He's been with me on cases before.

652
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,220
<16-16,BECKETT>他能顶得住压力
<16-16,BECKETT>He's good under pressure.

653
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,720
<16-16,BECKETT>所以他是最佳人选
<16-16,BECKETT>And he's our best shot.

654
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,670
<17-3,ALFRED>通常这个时候
<17-3,ALFRED>Okay, so this is usually the part

655
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,570
<17-4,BECKETT>我都会问当事人是否考虑清楚了
<17-4,BECKETT>Where I ask if you've thought this through,

656
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,070
<17-4,BECKETT>不过我记得你从来不三思而后行
<17-4,BECKETT>And then I rembered, you don't think things through.

657
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,970
<17-5,CASTLE>你的手真凉  冰棍一样
<17-5,CASTLE>Cold hands, cold hands.

658
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,170
<17-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这些人很危险
<17-6,BECKETT>These people are dangerous, Castle.

659
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,670
<17-6,BECKETT>你得保持警惕  集中精神
<17-6,BECKETT>You need to stay alert and focused.

660
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,670

662
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,970
<17-8,CASTLE>能不能搓搓手呢
<17-8,CASTLE>you just rubbed 'em together for a second.

663
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,270
<17-9,CASTLE>等等  警惕和什么来着
<17-9,CASTLE>Wait, wait. Alert and what?

664
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,570
<17-10,CASTLE>开玩笑的
<17-10,CASTLE>I'm just kidding.

669
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,470
<17-15,CASTLE>你不用解释
<17-15,CASTLE>You don't need to explain that.

670
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,770
<17-16,BECKETT>-那是  -不用吗
<17-16,BECKETT>- That's-- - I don't?

671
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,970
<17-17,CASTLE>除非你想
<17-17,CASTLE>Unless you want to.

672
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,970
<17-18,BECKETT>我只是想到  你知道的
<17-18,BECKETT>Uh, no, you know, I ju-- I just figured,

673
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,970
<17-18,BECKETT>对于那个角色妮基·希特
<17-18,BECKETT>For the character, for Nikki Heat--

<17-19,CASTLE>更了解妮基·希特
<17-19,CASTLE>Better than you think I do.

676
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,170
<17-20,BECKETT>小心点  好吗
<17-20,BECKETT>Be careful, okay?

677
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,470
<17-21,CASTLE>莫非你是在关心我的人身安全
<17-21,CASTLE>Do I detect actual concern for my well-Being?

678
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,070
<17-22,BECKETT>你要是搞砸了我就杀了你
<17-22,BECKETT>Screw this up, and I'll kill you.

685
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,570
<18-4,SORENSON>他很有个性
<18-4,SORENSON>He's quite a guy.

686
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,470
<18-4,SORENSON>但愿他知道你是他忠实的粉丝
<18-4,SORENSON>If he only knew how big a fan you really are.

687
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,570
<18-5,BECKETT>是啊  他不会知道的
<18-5,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he's not going to know.

688
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,170
<18-6,SORENSON>你没告诉他  为了得到他的签名
<18-6,SORENSON>You never told him how you stood in line for an hour

689
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,670
<18-6,SORENSON>你排队站了一个小时
<18-6,SORENSON>Just to get your book signed...

690
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,370
<18-6,SORENSON>他的小说陪你度过你母亲死后那段时光

693
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,670
<18-9,CASTLE>感觉就像迈克找到了藏在厕所后面的枪
<18-9,CASTLE>I feel like Michael finding the gun taped behind the toilet.

694
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,770
<18-10,CASTLE>恐怕你得让莱恩和埃斯波西托退回去
<18-10,CASTLE>You might want to tell Ryan and Esposito to hang back.

695
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,470
<18-10,CASTLE>他们发了条信息说"我们在监视你"
<18-10,CASTLE>They just sent a text. It says, "we're watching you."

696
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,270
<18-11,SORENSON>可能只是唬人的
<18-11,SORENSON>It could be just a ruse.

<18-12,CASTLE>不像
<18-12,CASTLE>Nope.

702
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,770
<18-14,SORENSON>让他别胡闹
<18-14,SORENSON>Tell him to stop fooling around.

703
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,270
<18-15,BECKETT>那有用吗
<18-15,BECKETT>Like that'll help.

<19-2,SORENSON>Making it impossible to trace.

734
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,770
<19-3,ALFRED>难道我们什么也做不了
<19-3,ALFRED>So we just do nothing?

735
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,250
<19-4,CASTLE>我把绑匪给我的手机
<19-4,CASTLE>Well, I managed to slip the phone

736
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,270
<19-4,CASTLE>放到那个包里面了
<19-4,CASTLE>That the kidnappers gave me inside the backpack.

737
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,670
<19-5,THERESA>什么意思
<19-5,THERESA>I don't understand.

738
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,670
<19-6,CASTLE>在那之前
<19-6,CASTLE>Well, before I did that,

739
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,670
<19-6,CASTLE>我给贝克特警探发了条信息
<19-6,CASTLE>I sent a text message to detective Beckett.

740
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,170
<19-7,BECKETT>手机是大单销售
<19-7,BECKETT>The phone's under a bulk account,

741
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,270
<19-7,BECKETT>查不到购买人的信息
<19-7,BECKETT>So we can't trace its owner,

742
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,770
<19-7,BECKETT>但能追踪到方位
<19-7,BECKETT>But we can trace its I.D.

743
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,470
<19-8,SORENSON>目前  查到它在下东区20条街区内
<19-8,SORENSON>So far, we've pinged the phone to a 20-Block radius on the lower east side.

744
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,970
<19-8,SORENSON>还需要几个小时把范围缩小
<19-8,SORENSON>We'll need another few hours to narrow it down.

745
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,270
<19-8,SORENSON>同时  我派了一组人过去
<19-8,SORENSON>In the meantime, I've moved a team into the area.

746
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,970
<19-8,SORENSON>他们会仔细排查  一旦得到更多消息
<19-8,SORENSON>They'll work the streets, be ready to move

747
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,870
<19-8,SORENSON>随时准备行动
<19-8,SORENSON>When we have more information.

748
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,470
<20-2,FBI TECH>-谢谢  -嗯
<20-2,FBI TECH>- Thanks. - Mm-Hmm.

749
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,370
<20-3,BECKETT>你还好吧
<20-3,BECKETT>You okay?

750
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,370
<20-4,CASTLE>我一直在想  要是我看到谁拿的就好了
<20-4,CASTLE>I keep thinking, if only I saw who took that bag...

751
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,570
<20-5,BECKETT>那不是你的工作
<20-5,BECKETT>Well, that wasn't your job.

752
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,510
<20-5,BECKETT>知道吗  我难以想象
<20-5,BECKETT>You know I can't imagine

753
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,570
<20-6,CASTLE>这样的事发生在阿丽克西斯身上会怎样
<20-6,CASTLE>Anything like this ever happening to Alexis.

754
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,270
<20-7,BECKETT>我们很快会救回她的
<20-7,BECKETT>We'll get her back soon.

755
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,270
<20-8,SORENSON>没有我们想的那么快
<20-8,SORENSON>Not as soon as we hoped.

756
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,670
<20-8,SORENSON>他们肯定发现了  把电池取出来了
<20-8,SORENSON>They must've found it, taken the batteries out.

757
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,270
<20-8,SORENSON>我们失去了手机的追踪信号
<20-8,SORENSON>We just lost the signal from the phone.

758
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,330
<21-2,CASTLE>怎么还不睡  担心期末考试
<21-2,CASTLE>What are you doing up? Stressed about finals?

759
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,630
<21-3,ALEXIS>今天是美国不眠日
<21-3,ALEXIS>American lit's today.

760
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,930
<21-3,ALEXIS>我做噩梦  梦到海丝特·白兰
<21-3,ALEXIS>I was having nightmares about Hester Prynne.

761
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,330
<21-4,CASTLE>但问题是不得"优"会让你难堪
<21-4,CASTLE>The irony for you is not getting an "a" would cause you shame.

762
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,030
<21-5,ALEXIS>那你怎么还不睡
<21-5,ALEXIS>So why are you up?

763
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,330
<21-6,CASTLE>我在找小白兔
<21-6,CASTLE>Looking for a white rabbit.

764
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,230
<21-7,ALEXIS>路易斯·卡罗尔或者"黑客帝国"
<21-7,ALEXIS>Lewis Carroll or "The Matrix"?

765
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,930
<21-8,CASTLE>还不确定
<21-8,CASTLE>I'm not sure yet.

766
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,830
<21-9,ALEXIS>关于犯罪现场的拍照贝克特跟你说了什么
<21-9,ALEXIS>What did Beckett tell you about taking phone photos at the crime scene?

767
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,130
<21-10,CASTLE>我不知道  没听
<21-10,CASTLE>I don't know. I wasn't listening.

768
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,190
<21-11,CASTLE>看到床上的那些动物娃娃了吗
<21-11,CASTLE>See all those stuffed animals on the bed?

769
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,830
<21-12,ALEXIS>跟我以前的很像
<21-12,ALEXIS>It looks just like mine used to.

770
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,730
<21-12,ALEXIS>还记得我以前的那些娃娃吗
<21-12,ALEXIS>Remember when I had all those animals?

771
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,930
<21-13,CASTLE>如果你是说Bonkey猴的话
<21-13,CASTLE>If by remember when, " you mean Monkey-Bonkey,

772
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,330
<21-13,CASTLE>被洗了那么多次  他现在看起来很惨
<21-13,CASTLE>Who has been washed so many times he looks like roadkill now,

773
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:16,930
<21-13,CASTLE>那么  是
<21-13,CASTLE>Then, yes.

774
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:18,330
<21-14,ALEXIS>我搞不懂你在说些什么
<21-14,ALEXIS>I have no idea what you're talking about.

775
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,830
<21-15,CASTLE>那么你不会介意下次我看到他的时候
<21-15,CASTLE>Oh, then you won't mind next time I see him

776
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,130
<21-15,CASTLE>-把他扔出去  -你敢
<21-15,CASTLE>- If I throw him out. - Don't you dare!

777
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,830
<21-17,CASTLE>-我不会  不会的  -绝对不要
<21-17,CASTLE>- I won't, I won't. - Don't.

778
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,930
<21-17,CASTLE>-不会的  -很好
<21-17,CASTLE>- I won't. - Okay.

779
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,030
<21-18,ALEXIS>好
<21-18,ALEXIS>Okay.

780
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,130
<21-20,ALEXIS>你认为邦尼兔和这个案子有关
<21-20,ALEXIS>So you think the Bunny has something to do with the case?

781
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,130
<21-21,CASTLE>等我到兔窝里看一下再告诉你
<21-21,CASTLE>I'll let you know when I go down the rabbit hole.

782
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,430
<22-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<22-1,BECKETT>Castle?

783
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,330
<22-2,CASTLE>继续睡吧
<22-2,CASTLE>Go back to sleep.

784
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,030
<22-3,BECKETT>你在干什么
<22-3,BECKETT>What are you doing?

785
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,930
<22-4,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯还小的时候
<22-4,CASTLE>When Alexis was little,

786
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,330
<22-4,CASTLE>她有一个很珍爱的猴子娃娃  整天抱着
<22-4,CASTLE>She had a stuffed monkey that she could not live without.

787
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,630
<22-4,CASTLE>有一次我们去度假  她忘了带上他了
<22-4,CASTLE>One time we went on vacation, she forgot to pack him.

788
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,630
<22-4,CASTLE>我又给她买了一个
<22-4,CASTLE>I bought her another one,

789
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,930
<22-4,CASTLE>但她知道不是原来那个
<22-4,CASTLE>But she knew it was not monkey-Bonkey.

790
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,930
<22-6,CASTLE>然后呢
<22-6,CASTLE>So?

791
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,030
<22-7,CASTLE>有几张照片都是她拿着这只邦尼兔
<22-7,CASTLE>So there's two more pictures of her clutching this Bunny out there.

792
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,730
<22-7,CASTLE>那么邦尼兔在哪儿呢
<22-7,CASTLE>So where's the Bunny?

793
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,220
<22-8,BECKETT>你认为绑匪很熟悉安吉拉的喜好
<22-8,BECKETT>You think whoever took Angela knew her well enough

794
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,530
<22-8,BECKETT>所以把邦尼兔也带上啦
<22-8,BECKETT>To take the Bunny, too?

795
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,030
<22-8,BECKETT>但我们已经查过坎德拉家的人员名单了
<22-8,BECKETT>But we already checked the Candelas' list.

796
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,830
<22-8,BECKETT>有几个年轻保姆
<22-8,BECKETT>A couple of teenage babysitters,

797
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,830
<22-8,BECKETT>一个清洁工  她们都被排除嫌疑了
<22-8,BECKETT>A cleaning lady... They've all been cleared.

798
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,630
<22-9,CASTLE>但不是所有保姆都是青少年
<22-9,CASTLE>Only not all babysitters are teenagers.

799
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,030
<22-9,CASTLE>有时候他们就是我们周围的人
<22-9,CASTLE>Sometimes they're people close to us.

800
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,830
<22-9,CASTLE>有时是家人
<22-9,CASTLE>Sometimes they're family.

801
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,630
<22-9,CASTLE>我们什么时候丢了手机上的信号的
<22-9,CASTLE>When did we lose the signal on the phone?

802
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,930
<22-10,BECKETT>在告诉坎德拉夫妇我们在追踪之后
<22-10,BECKETT>Right after we told the Candelas we were tracking it.

803
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,030
<22-11,BECKETT>特里萨的妹妹妮娜  你有她地址吗
<22-11,BECKETT>Theresa's sister Nina-- You got an address?

804
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,330
<23-1,SORENSON>妮娜·门多萨

805
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,530

<23-1,SORENSON>You're under arrest for the kidnapping of Angela Candela.

806
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,430
<23-2,ESPOSITO>竟然绑架自己的外甥女  把手放背后
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Taking your own niece? Put your hands behind your back.

807
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,430
<23-3,RYAN>你有权保持沉默
<23-3,RYAN>You have the right to remain silent...

808
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,830
<23-4,BECKETT>你好  安吉拉

00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,330
<24-15,THERESA>照顾  你把她扔在那儿
<24-15,THERESA>Taking care? You left her there...

838
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,230
<24-15,THERESA>每天把她放在电视机面前
<24-15,THERESA>In front of the TV every day!

839
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,930
<24-15,THERESA>你们知道我有多少次被她的尖叫声吵醒吗
<24-15,THERESA>Do you know how many times I woke up to her screams,

840
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,930
<24-15,THERESA>因为他在那个房间里  耳朵塞着耳机
<24-15,THERESA>Because he was in that room blasting the music in his ears?

841
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,330
<24-16,BECKETT>但你也不能绑架你自己的孩子
<24-16,BECKETT>It doesn't give you the right to kidnap your own child.

842
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,130
<24-17,THERESA>怎么是绑架  她是我女儿
<24-17,THERESA>How is it kidnapping? She's my daughter.

843
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,900
<24-18,BECKETT>坎德拉太太  你让你妹妹
<24-18,BECKETT>Mrs. Candela, you had your sister

844
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,830
<24-18,BECKETT>从那个窗户爬进来带走她
<24-18,BECKETT>Climb through that window and take her.

845
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,230
<24-19,THERESA>她得到了我的允许
<24-19,THERESA>I gave her permission.

846
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,530
<24-19,THERESA>那也不行
<24-19,THERESA>It doesn't matter.

847
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,230
<24-20,BECKETT>你触犯了你丈夫的监护权
<24-20,BECKETT>You violated your husband's custodial rights.

848
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,330
<24-20,BECKETT>监护权
<24-20,BECKETT>Custodial rights?

849
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,230
<24-21,THERESA>他根本都没有注意到她不见了
<24-21,THERESA>He didn't even notice that she was gone!

850
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:23,130
<24-21,THERESA>对两岁的孩子来说他到底算个什么父亲
<24-21,THERESA>What kind of a father does that to his 2-Year-Old child?

851
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,830
<24-22,ALFRED>你为什么要这么做
<24-22,ALFRED>Why would you do this?

852
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,230
<24-22,ALFRED>为什么要搞成这样
<24-22,ALFRED>Why would you put us through that?

853
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,530
<24-22,ALFRED>为什么不直接和我离婚
<24-22,ALFRED>I mean, for god's sake, why not just divorce me?

854
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,330
<24-23,THERESA>哦  然后你起诉我索要赡养费
<24-23,THERESA>Oh, so that you can sue me for alimony?

855
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,330
<24-23,THERESA>分得一半的财产
<24-23,THERESA>So that you can get half of everything?

856
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,830
<24-23,THERESA>获得安吉拉的监护权
<24-23,THERESA>So that you can get custody of Angela

857
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:43,330
<24-23,THERESA>因为我整天都要工作而你可以在那照顾她
<24-23,THERESA>Because I'm at work all day and you can "be there for her"?

858
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,630
<24-23,THERESA>没门
<24-23,THERESA>No.

859
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,030
<24-23,THERESA>我见识过了人在工作时的样子
<24-23,THERESA>I've seen what happens to the guys at work,

860
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,530
<24-23,THERESA>看到了道埃勒家族的下场
<24-23,THERESA>What happened to Doug Ellers.

861
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,530
<24-23,THERESA>我绝不会让那发生在我身上
<24-23,THERESA>No way was that gonna happen to me!

862
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,230
<24-24,CASTLE>你在交赎金给自己
<24-24,CASTLE>You were paying the ransom to yourself.

863
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:03,230
<24-25,THERESA>安吉拉一回来  我就申请离婚
<24-25,THERESA>Once Angela returned, I would file for the papers.

864
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,930
<24-25,THERESA>他就会一无所有了
<24-25,THERESA>There would be nothing left for him to take.

865
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,460
<24-26,BECKETT>如果安吉拉是在阿尔弗雷德
<24-26,BECKETT>And if Angela was kidnapped

866
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,130
<24-26,BECKETT>照看她时被绑架了  那么
<24-26,BECKETT>When Alfred was taking care of her, then--

867
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,830
<24-27,THERESA>律师说过
<24-27,THERESA>The lawyer said that

868
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,430
<24-27,THERESA>如果能证明他疏忽大意  我就能获得监护权
<24-27,THERESA>If I could prove him negligent, I would get custody.

869
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,630
<24-27,THERESA>我不需要搬出我买的房子
<24-27,THERESA>I wouldn't have to move out of the apartment that I paid for

870
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:19,930
<24-27,THERESA>因此他可以和我女儿住在这儿
<24-27,THERESA>So that he could live here with my daughter.

871
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,830
<24-27,THERESA>你们知道收养她有多难吗
<24-27,THERESA>Do you know how hard it was to adopt her,

872
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,430
<24-27,THERESA>代价有多大吗
<24-27,THERESA>How much it cost?

873
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,430
<24-27,THERESA>十年啊
<24-27,THERESA>Ten years!

874
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,330
<24-27,THERESA>你卖过几张画  阿尔弗雷德
<24-27,THERESA>How many paintings have you sold, Alfred? Huh?

875
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,630
<25-2,BECKETT>几张
<25-2,BECKETT>How many?

876
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,130
<24-28,ALFRED>你为什么这么恨我
<24-28,ALFRED>How could you hate me so much?

877
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,630
<24-29,THERESA>这都是你造成的
<24-29,THERESA>You made it easy.

878
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,130
<25-1,SORENSON>你觉得她会怎样
<25-1,SORENSON>So how do you think she'll do?

879
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,130
<25-2,BECKETT>这取决于陪审团中有多少个母亲
<25-2,BECKETT>Well, it depends on how many mothers are on the jury.

880
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,630
<25-2,BECKETT>那么
<25-2,BECKETT>So...

881
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,430
<25-3,SORENSON>现在案子结了
<25-3,SORENSON>Now that it's over...

882
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,930
<25-3,SORENSON>我也要回去了  我原来..
<25-3,SORENSON>Now that I'm back, I was...

883
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,030
<25-3,SORENSON>打算我们可以旧梦重温
<25-3,SORENSON>Thinking maybe we could give it another shot.

884
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,730
<25-4,BECKETT>如果你又要离开呢
<25-4,BECKETT>And when you leave again?

885
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,330
<25-5,SORENSON>你跟我一起走
<25-5,SORENSON>You come with me.

886
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,930
<25-6,SORENSON>考虑一下吧
<25-6,SORENSON>Think about it.

887
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,930
<25-7,CASTLE>他很不错
<25-7,CASTLE>Nice guy.

888
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,530
<25-7,CASTLE>但我知道那不管用
<25-7,CASTLE>I can see how it wouldn't work, though.

889
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,130
<25-8,BECKETT>-是吗  -当然
<25-8,BECKETT>- Really? - Sure.

890
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,330
<25-11,CASTLE>英俊  方下巴  很端正
<25-11,CASTLE>Handsome, square-Jawed, by-The-Book...

891
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,730
<25-12,BECKETT>难道那不好吗
<25-12,BECKETT>And that's a bad thing?

892
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,230
<25-13,CASTLE>好啊  正符合你的标准
<25-13,CASTLE>Yeah, he's like the male you.

893
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,130
<25-13,CASTLE>阴阳结合  而不是阴阴结合
<25-13,CASTLE>Yin needs yang, not another yin.

894
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,430
<25-13,CASTLE>阴阳结合才协调
<25-13,CASTLE>"Yin-Yang" is harmony.

895
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,130
<25-13,CASTLE>"迎迎"还是个熊猫的名字
<25-13,CASTLE>"Yin-Yin" is... A name for a panda.

896
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,530
<25-14,BECKETT>还有什么至理名言吗  欧比旺
<25-14,BECKETT>Any more wisdom, Obi-Wan?

897
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,330
<25-15,CASTLE>没有了  今天就这些
<25-15,CASTLE>Nope, that's it for today.

898
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,430
<25-15,CASTLE>我们去喝一杯庆祝一下怎么样
<25-15,CASTLE>What say we celebrate by going out for a drink?

899
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,330
<25-16,BECKETT>不行  我有约会
<25-16,BECKETT>I can't. I got a date.

900
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,930
<25-17,CASTLE>约会  你在约会
<25-17,CASTLE>A date? You date?

901
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,230
<25-17,CASTLE>和谁
<25-17,CASTLE>Who?

902
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,530
<25-18,BECKETT>之所以有"私生活"这个词
<25-18,BECKETT>That's why it's called a "private life,"

903
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,030
<25-18,BECKETT>是因为这属于个人隐私
<25-18,BECKETT>Because it's private.

904
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:25,360
<25-18,BECKETT>不像你  我不会把我的生活暴露给别人
<25-18,BECKETT>Unlike you, I don't live my life on "page six."

905
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:30,230
<25-19,CASTLE>看来你是个很神秘的人  贝克特探长
<25-19,CASTLE>Well, you're a mysterious woman, Detective Beckett.

906
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,460
<25-20,BECKETT>可能我有尼基·希特身上不具备的东西
<25-20,BECKETT>Maybe there's a little more Nikki Heat in me than you think.
