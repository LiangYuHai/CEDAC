7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,140
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>我刚刚..准备试试万圣节的服装
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>I was--I was just... trying on my halloween costume.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,820
<1-3,ALEXIS>你到底想扮成什么
<1-3,ALEXIS>What exactly are you supposed to be?

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,070
<1-4,CASTLE>太空牛仔
<1-4,CASTLE>Space cowboy.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,340
<1-5,ALEXIS>首先  太空没牛仔
<1-5,ALEXIS>Ok. A, there are no cows in space.

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,880
<1-5,ALEXIS>其次  五年前你不是穿过这身吗
<1-5,ALEXIS>B, didn't you wear that, like, five years ago?

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,360
<1-7,ALEXIS>-所以呢  -不想换件别的穿
<1-7,ALEXIS>- So? - So don't you think you should move on?

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,020
<1-8,CASTLE>就喜欢这身  这么晚你还在做什么
<1-8,CASTLE>I like it. What are you doing up so late anyway?

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,110
<1-9,ALEXIS>万圣节的功课
<1-9,ALEXIS>Halloween homework--

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,470
<1-9,ALEXIS>《掠夺者们》 《电锯惊魂》根据这本书改编
<1-9,ALEXIS>"The pit & the pendulum," the original "Saw."

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,430
<1-10,CASTLE>想好今年过节穿什么了吗
<1-10,CASTLE>Have you decided what you're gonna dress up as this year?

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,550
<1-10,CASTLE>英迪拉·甘地  阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特
<1-10,CASTLE>Perhaps Indira Gandhi, Amelia Earhart?

18
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,340
<1-10,CASTLE>赫敏
<1-10,CASTLE>Oh! Hermione?

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,240
<1-11,ALEXIS>我不想过万圣节了
<1-11,ALEXIS>I think I'm gonna skip it.

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,380
<1-12,CASTLE>不过节啦
<1-12,CASTLE>Skip Halloween?

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,920
<1-13,ALEXIS>打扮好  不就是照样站在门口发糖
<1-13,ALEXIS>Well, dressing up. I'll still hand out candy at the door,

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
<1-13,ALEXIS>我已经过了玩不给糖就捣乱的年纪了
<1-13,ALEXIS>but I'm too old to go trick-or-treating anymore.

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,400
<1-13,ALEXIS>知道看到那些孩子来  我什么感觉吗
<1-13,ALEXIS>And you know how I feel when the big kids come.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,580
<1-13,ALEXIS>我可不想当那种孩子
<1-13,ALEXIS>I don't want to be that kid.

25
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,180
<1-14,CASTLE>但你得和我一起去
<1-14,CASTLE>But you have to go with me.

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,290
<1-14,CASTLE>你是我的糖胡子
<1-14,CASTLE>You are my candy beard.

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,280
<1-15,ALEXIS>对不起爸爸  你得另找个糖胡子了
<1-15,ALEXIS>Sorry, dad. You're just gonna have to get another beard.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,990
<1-16,CASTLE>这件事我们每年都争
<1-16,CASTLE>This discussion is not over.

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,210
<1-16,CASTLE>你们在那个父母培训组
<1-16,CASTLE>So... have you come up with a name

30
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,470
<1-16,CASTLE>为这个蛋宝宝起好名字了吗
<1-16,CASTLE>for your parenting project baby egg yet?

31
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,840
<1-16,CASTLE>等等  我先猜猜
<1-16,CASTLE>Wait. Let--let me guess.

32
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,250
<1-16,CASTLE>扎克·弗隆宝宝  还是小艾德·博格里宝宝
<1-16,CASTLE>Zac Eggfron? No. Egg Begley JR.?

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,180
<1-17,ALEXIS>我起了个狄更斯式的名字  佩吉和我叫他费吉恩
<1-17,ALEXIS>I went dickensian. Paige and I are calling him Feggin.

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,120
<1-17,ALEXIS>-能明白吧  -费吉恩
<1-17,ALEXIS>- Get it? - Feggin?

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,060
<1-19,ALEXIS>-假的蛋宝宝[费吉恩的谐音]  -假蛋蛋如何
<1-19,ALEXIS>- Fake baby egg. - Wouldn't that be fakegg?

36
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,210
<1-20,CASTLE>贝克特  这么晚有何贵干
<1-20,CASTLE>Beckett, what are you doing up so late?

37
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,700
<2-1,CASTLE>我很喜欢一年中的这个时节
<2-1,CASTLE>Ah, I just love this time of year--

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,750
<2-1,CASTLE>脚下清脆作响的落叶  清新爽洁的空气
<2-1,CASTLE>Crunchy leaves underfoot, the crisp, clean air,

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,930
<2-1,CASTLE>点着南瓜灯的味道
<2-1,CASTLE>The smell of jack-o'-lanterns all aflame.

40
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,370
<2-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>警察说不出这种话
<2-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that if you were a cop.

41
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,660
<2-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>万圣节算是我们一年里最难熬的日子
<2-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>Halloween's one of the worst weeks of the year for us.

42
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,120
<2-3,CASTLE>尸体进了墓地
<2-3,CASTLE>The body's already in a graveyard.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,820
<2-3,CASTLE>有的人想省点时间
<2-3,CASTLE>Someone was trying to save some time.

44
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,390
<2-3,CASTLE>我喜欢在墓地里走
<2-3,CASTLE>I do love walking through cemeteries.

45
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,810
<2-3,CASTLE>喜欢看他们的故事  看这个
<2-3,CASTLE>I love their stories. Check out this one.

46
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,090
<2-3,CASTLE>伊里莎白·戴登  1962年12月3日至...
<2-3,CASTLE>"Elizabeth Dryden, December 3, 1962-?"

47
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,330
<2-3,CASTLE>连死亡日期都不清楚  这里埋的又是什么呢
<2-3,CASTLE>If they don't even know when she die, what's buried here?

48
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,370
<2-4,BECKETT>你穿着吊裤带吗
<2-4,BECKETT>Are you wearing suspenders?

49
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,050
<2-5,CASTLE>试试万圣节晚会的礼服
<2-5,CASTLE>I'm trying on costumes for my annual halloween party.

50
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,500
<2-5,CASTLE>礼服可不能少
<2-5,CASTLE>Costumes are mandatory.

51
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,100
<2-7,DR LANIE PARISH>-什么情况  -看看吧
<2-7,DR LANIE PARISH>- What's the story, you guys? - Take a look.

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,890
<2-9,BECKETT>不会吧  他心脏上插的是木钉吗
<2-9,BECKETT>Are you kidding me? Is that a stake in his heart?

53
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,040
<2-10,CASTLE>看来吸血鬼猎人巴菲光顾纽约了
<2-10,CASTLE>Looks like Buffy's visited the big apple.

54
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,960
<2-11,BECKETT>-有人把他当成吸血鬼了  -看着也像
<2-11,BECKETT>- Someone thought he was a vampire. - So did he.

55
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,080
<2-12,LANIE>这可不像塑料制品
<2-12,LANIE>And they're not plastic pop-ins either.

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,310
<2-13,BECKETT>你是说这是真牙吗
<2-13,BECKETT>Are you telling me those are real?

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,600
<2-14,LANIE>-可能是高档烤瓷牙  -或者此人就是吸血鬼
<2-14,LANIE>- Or high-end veneers. - Or he's a vampire.

58
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,160
<2-15,CASTLE>没身份证  没电话
<2-15,CASTLE>No I.D. No phone.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,670
<2-16,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>附近都找遍了
<2-16,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>We got guys sweepin' the area for anything they can find.

60
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,190
<2-17,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>-也没有目击证人  -看起来像扭打过
<2-17,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>- No witnesses either. - Looks like he struggled.

61
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,870
<2-18,LANIE>他的头撞到这块石头
<2-18,LANIE>I'm thinking he hit his head on this stone

62
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,490
<2-18,LANIE>或是被人揪住头撞向石头  然后又捅了一下
<2-18,LANIE>or someone knocked him in the head before he was stabbed.

63
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,810
<2-19,BECKETT>谁会费这么大劲杀人
<2-19,BECKETT>Who would go to the trouble of killing someone that way?

64
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,310
<2-20,CASTLE>狼人  他们和吸血鬼不共戴天
<2-20,CASTLE>Lycans. They've been at war with the vampires

65
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,290
<2-20,CASTLE>宿怨从15世纪卢西恩被杀就结下了
<2-20,CASTLE>Ever since Lucian was murdered in the 15th century...

66
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,060
<3-1,CASTLE>当然这只是个人想法
<3-1,CASTLE>Again, this is just theory.

67
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,740
<3-2,LANIE>哪里不对
<3-2,LANIE>What is wrong?

68
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,560
<3-3,CASTLE>如果他是吸血鬼  拔出木钉
<3-3,CASTLE>If he's a vampire and you pull that out,

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,690
<3-3,CASTLE>就会起死回生
<3-3,CASTLE>He comes back to life.

70
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,360
<3-4,LANIE>能活过来  我们就可以早点回家
<3-4,LANIE>If he does, then we can all go home early.

71
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,560
<3-5,BECKETT>搞清他是什么人或什么物吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Any idea as to who or... what he is?

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,390
<3-6,LANIE>他是人类  獠牙是烤瓷的
<3-6,LANIE>He's human, and the fangs are ceramic veneers.

73
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,200
<3-6,LANIE>大腿动脉有两处新撕痕
<3-6,LANIE>But he has two fresh avulsions near the femoral artery.

74
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,890
<3-7,CASTLE>大腿上的是咬痕吗
<3-7,CASTLE>Bite marks on his thigh?

75
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,240
<3-8,LANIE>我在尸体上找到这个
<3-8,LANIE>And I found these on his body.

76
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,000
<3-8,LANIE>人造纤维  杀手戴着假发
<3-8,LANIE>They're synthetic. Your killer was wearing a wig.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,500
<3-9,BECKETT>把木钉插进心脏可非易事
<3-9,BECKETT>It can't be easy to drive a stake through someone's chest.

78
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,600
<3-10,LANIE>打碎胸腔  还得用上石头
<3-10,LANIE>To break the rib cage, you'd have to pound it in with a rock.

79
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,500
<3-11,CASTLE>某人行刺前看来忘记洗手了
<3-11,CASTLE>Someone didn't wash their hands before the stabbing.

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,100
<3-11,CASTLE>看看这些黑色污迹
<3-11,CASTLE>Check out these black smudges.

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,300
<3-12,BECKETT>让犯罪现场组查查这根木钉
<3-12,BECKETT>You know, have C.S.U. run the stake.

82
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,240
<3-12,BECKETT>找到与死者吻合的指纹了吗
<3-12,BECKETT>Any match on the vic's prints?

83
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,020
<3-13,LANIE>系统里没有  失踪人口里也没有
<3-13,LANIE>Nothing in the system, no hits with missing persons,

84
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,810
<3-13,LANIE>查不出身份
<3-13,LANIE>No I.D.

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,410
<3-14,CASTLE>-但他的牙能以假乱真  -所以呢
<3-14,CASTLE>- But he has professional veneers. - Yeah. So?

86
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,200
<3-16,CASTLE>我认识城里最棒的獠牙制造大师
<3-16,CASTLE>I know the best fangmaster in the city.

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,320
<3-16,CASTLE>-也许他能认出死者  -獠牙制造大师
<3-16,CASTLE>- Maybe he could identify him. - Fangmaster?

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,090
<4-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  希望你说的是真的
<4-1,BECKETT>I hope this is for real, Castle,

89
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,110
<4-1,BECKETT>否则  我们就有愚弄无名尸的嫌疑
<4-1,BECKETT>Because if it's not, we're shortchanging our John Doe.

90
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,090
<4-2,CASTLE>相信我  真不敢相信你们居然没听说这地方
<4-2,CASTLE>Oh, trust me. I can't believe you've never heard this place.

91
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,810
<4-2,CASTLE>我的全套行头都在这里买的
<4-2,CASTLE>I get all my costumes here.

92
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,730
<4-2,CASTLE>正好给你选一套装扮来参加我的万圣节派队
<4-2,CASTLE>We can use this opportunity to find you one for my halloween party.

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,300
<4-2,CASTLE>思春的小护士如何
<4-2,CASTLE>How about... slutty nurse?

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,450
<4-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你这是痴心妄想
<4-3,BECKETT>Fantasize all you want, Castle.

95
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,940
<4-3,BECKETT>我怎么可能为了你穿那些
<4-3,BECKETT>I am not trying on costumes for you.

96
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,060
<4-4,CASTLE>不穿  为什么不  你有行头了
<4-4,CASTLE>No? Why not? You already got one

97
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,050
<4-5,BECKETT>谁说我要参加你的派对
<4-5,BECKETT>Who says I'm even coming to your party?

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,500
<4-6,DR BARRY FRANK>理查德·卡塞尔  改主意了
<4-6,DR BARRY FRANK>Richard Castle. Change your mind?

99
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,000
<4-6,DR BARRY FRANK>我给你来一副双层加固  肯定适合你
<4-6,DR BARRY FRANK>I'd love to fit you with a nice set of doubles.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,430
<4-7,CASTLE>医生  今天来是为了公事
<4-7,CASTLE>Uh, official police business today, doc.

101
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,240
<4-7,CASTLE>贝克特警探  介绍一下
<4-7,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, I would like to

102

103
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,020
<4-7,CASTLE>顶尖的獠牙制造大师
<4-7,CASTLE>And fangmaster extraordinaire.

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,930
<4-7,CASTLE>布拉德·皮特《夜访吸血鬼》的假牙
<4-7,CASTLE>He did, Brad Pitt's veneers for

105
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,000
<4-7,CASTLE>也是出自他手
<4-7,CASTLE>"Interview with the vampire."

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,340
<4-8,DR FRANK>我能帮你什么忙吗  大师就在这里
<4-8,DR FRANK>So what can I do for you? The master is in.

107
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,690
<4-9,BECKETT>我们正在调查一起凶杀案
<4-9,BECKETT>We're investigating a homicide,

108
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,440
<4-9,BECKETT>死者做过牙
<4-9,BECKETT>And our victim had some work done.

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
<4-9,BECKETT>希望你能帮忙辨认一下此人
<4-9,BECKETT>We were hoping you could help identify him.

110
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,380
<4-10,DR FRANK>那人叫克鲁
<4-10,DR FRANK>Oh. That's Crow.

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,640
<4-10,DR FRANK>我给他镶过牙  好像是两个月前吧
<4-10,DR FRANK>I did his veneers about, uh, I don't know, two months ago.

112
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,290
<4-11,BECKETT>克鲁
<4-11,BECKETT>Crow?

113
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,300
<4-12,CASTLE>崇拜吸血鬼的人
<4-12,CASTLE>Oh, people in the vampire fetish community,

114
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,090
<4-12,CASTLE>不用俗家的名字
<4-12,CASTLE>They give up their mundane names.

115
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,020
<4-12,CASTLE>没人会用大卫  查克或梅杰这种名字
<4-12,CASTLE>You're not gonna find any Daves or Chucks or Megs here.

116
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,580
<4-13,DR FRANK>他人不错  出什么事了
<4-13,DR FRANK>He seemed like a nice kid. What happened?

117
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,650
<4-14,BECKETT>我们会查明的
<4-14,BECKETT>That's what we're trying to figure out.

118
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,640
<4-14,BECKETT>希望你能提供他的本名或账单地址
<4-14,BECKETT>We were hoping you would have a legal name or a billing address.

119
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,850
<4-15,DR FRANK>-好  我去找  -谢谢
<4-15,DR FRANK>- Sure. Just, uh, let me look it up. - Thank you.

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,020
<4-15,DR FRANK>卡塞尔  你在做什么
<4-15,DR FRANK>Castle, what are you doing?

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,500
<4-15,DR FRANK>这能带给我不死之躯吗
<4-15,DR FRANK>Do these make me look immortal?

122
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,020
<4-15,DR FRANK>想让我来咬一口吗
<4-15,DR FRANK>Do you want to, uh, go get something pierced?

123
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,710
<4-15,DR FRANK>不  你呢
<4-15,DR FRANK>No. Do you?

124
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,060
<5-1,LANDLADY>这是马修的公寓
<5-1,LANDLADY>This is Matthew's apartment.

125
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,590
<5-1,LANDLADY>你们觉得他很捣蛋  但马修却是安静害羞
<5-1,LANDLADY>You'd think he'd be trouble,but Matthew was a quiet kid, shy

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,340
<5-2,BECKETT>最近有没有听到或看到异常的事
<5-2,BECKETT>Had, you, uh, heard or seen anything unusual lately?

127
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,500
<5-3,LANDLADY>扮吸血鬼有些怪异
<5-3,LANDLADY>The vampire thing was a little weird,

128
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,630
<5-3,LANDLADY>但我第一任丈夫是内战重演爱好者
<5-3,LANDLADY>But my first husband was a civil war reenactor.

129
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,120
<5-3,LANDLADY>你们说哪个更怪呢
<5-3,LANDLADY>So you tell me, which is weirder?

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,110
<5-5,LANDLADY>-简直是艺术家  -对  不过大多是漫画
<5-5,LANDLADY>- Ah, he was quite the artist.- Yeah, but mostly comic books.

131
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,980
<5-6,CASTLE>让我想到早期的弗兰克·米勒
<5-6,CASTLE>It reminds me of early Frank Miller.

132
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,940
<5-7,BECKETT>哪部 史诗系列《300》还是《黑骑士归来》
<5-7,BECKETT>Which Frank--epic 300 or dark horse years?

133
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,770
<5-8,CASTLE>天啊  这是你说过最吸引人的话
<5-8,CASTLE>Oh, my god. That is the sexiest thing I ever heard you say.

134
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,950
<5-8,CASTLE>没料到你还喜欢漫画书
<5-8,CASTLE>I had no idea you were interested in comic books.

135
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,530
<5-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我的事你不了解的多着呢
<5-9,BECKETT>Oh, Castle. The things you don't know about me could fill a book.

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,380
<5-10,CASTLE>看这个
<5-10,CASTLE>Hey. Check this out.

137
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,230
<5-10,CASTLE>他在制作漫画书
<5-10,CASTLE>He was developing a graphic novel.

138
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,900
<5-11,BECKETT>很有才华
<5-11,BECKETT>He's talented.

139
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,100
<5-11,BECKETT>克鲁谈起过自己的家人吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Did Crow ever talk about his family?

140
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,870
<5-12,LANDLADY>从来没有
<5-12,LANDLADY>Well, he never mentioned any.

141
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,070
<5-12,LANDLADY>我想这孩子要自立  不太合群
<5-12,LANDLADY>I just figured he was pretty much on his own, a loner.

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
<5-13,BECKETT>他像在巴克尔设计学院上学
<5-13,BECKETT>It looks like he went to the Barker school of design.

143
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,910
<5-13,BECKETT>虽然与现实社会联系不多
<5-13,BECKETT>There's only a partial social.

144
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,690
<5-13,BECKETT>但通过学校应该能找到
<5-13,BECKETT>But we should be able to track down

145
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,270
<5-13,BECKETT>孩子的亲人
<5-13,BECKETT>His next of kin through the school.

<5-15,LANDLADY>有个女孩  他带回来过一两次
<5-15,LANDLADY>He brought a girl here once or twice.

<5-15,LANDLADY>She was one of them.

149
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,360
<5-15,LANDLADY>笑的时候露出那种牙
<5-15,LANDLADY>You could see them when she smiled.

<5-15,LANDLADY>有一晚他们大吵一架
<5-15,LANDLADY>They did have a big fight the other night.

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,690
<5-15,LANDLADY>女孩不停地叫嚷
<5-15,LANDLADY>She was screaming bloody murder.

<7-22,BECKETT>有人看到你们最近起过争执

205
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,750
<7-23,VIXEN>所以你们在他身上发现我的头发
<7-23,VIXEN>That's why you found my hair on him.

00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,770
<7-25,VIXEN>还跟他谈出漫画书的事
<7-25,VIXEN>And talked him into writing a graphic novel.

209
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,310
<7-25,VIXEN>这是他的死因
<7-25,VIXEN>That's why he's dead.

<10-27,BECKETT>Wh-what'd you get a hit on?

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,740
<10-28,RYAN>插进克劳心脏的木钉上的污迹
<10-28,RYAN>The, uh, prints from the stake in Crow's heart.

320
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,960
<10-29,BECKETT>-女孩威妮森说得对  -指纹属于摩根·洛克白
<10-29,BECKETT>- Your girl Vixen was right. - Morgan Lockerby.

321
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,060
<10-30,ESPOSITO>只可惜  此人无处可找
<10-30,ESPOSITO>Only thing is, he's one of the great unfindables.

322
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,460
<10-30,ESPOSITO>没地址  没电话  没有踪迹
<10-30,ESPOSITO>No address, no phone number, no trail.

323
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,570
<10-31,CASTLE>也许有呢  看这
<10-31,CASTLE>Maybe not. Here.

324
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,510
<10-31,CASTLE>认出这个拐角了吗
<10-31,CASTLE>Recognize that corner?

325
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,400
<10-32,BECKETT>布鲁姆和克林顿  在纽约下东区
<10-32,BECKETT>That's Broome and Clinton, lower east side.

326
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,110
<10-33,CASTLE>克劳可能给我们画了张地图去找摩洛克
<10-33,CASTLE>I think Crow may have drawn us a road map to Morlock.

327
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,580
<10-33,CASTLE>这里走
<10-33,CASTLE>It's that way.

328
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,150
<11-1,BECKETT>不会吧
<11-1,BECKETT>You gotta be kidding me.

329
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,010
<11-2,RYAN>-他就睡这里面  -现在是白天
<11-2,RYAN>- You think he's in there? - It is daytime.

330
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,060
<11-3,ESPOSITO>如果他认为自己是吸血鬼  就会躺这里面
<11-3,ESPOSITO>If he thinks he's a vampire, that's where he'd be.

331
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,790
<11-4,BECKETT>有我呢
<11-4,BECKETT>I'll cover you.

337
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,700
<11-8,RYAN>见他蹿出来了吗
<11-8,RYAN>You see him jump?

338
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,310
<11-9,ESPOSITO>真是男子汉  卡塞尔
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Real macho, Castle.

339
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,300
<11-11,RYAN>把他弄开  把他弄开
<11-11,RYAN>Get him off! Get him off!

340
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,690
<11-12,CASTLE>-把他从我身上弄开  -从他身上弄开
<11-12,CASTLE>- Get him off me! - Get him off of him.

341
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,250
<11-14,CASTLE>-他咬我  -真是个吸血鬼
<11-14,CASTLE>- Aah! He bit me. - Look! He is a vampire.

342
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,550
<12-1,LANIE>他不是吸血鬼
<12-1,LANIE>He's not a vampire.

343
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,600
<12-2,ESPOSITO>但阳光把他灼伤了
<12-2,ESPOSITO>But his skin burned when the light hit him.

344
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,640
<12-3,LANIE>他有卟啉症  也称吸血鬼病
<12-3,LANIE>He has porphyria. Some people call it the vampire disease.

345
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,490
<12-3,LANIE>症状之一就是对光极度敏感
<12-3,LANIE>Its symptoms include extreme photosensitivity.

346
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,270
<12-3,LANIE>若暴露在阳光下  皮肤就会起泡
<12-3,LANIE>The skin blisters when it's exposed to the sun.

347
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,140
<12-3,LANIE>患者容易产生幻觉和妄想
<12-3,LANIE>Victims are prone to hallucinations, paranoia.

348
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,680
<12-4,BECKETT>这也说明了他的精神诊断
<12-4,BECKETT>That explains his psych diagnosis.

349
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,580
<12-5,CASTLE>这病传染吗
<12-5,CASTLE>Exactly how contagious is it?

350
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,320
<12-6,LANIE>这是遗传病
<12-6,LANIE>It's a genetic disease.

351
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,570
<12-6,LANIE>另外  我在咬伤处涂了抗生素
<12-6,LANIE>Besides, I put enough antibiotics on that bite

352
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,020
<12-6,LANIE>以杀死细菌
<12-6,LANIE>To kill the small animal.

353
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,000
<12-6,LANIE>如果没事了  我要回去
<12-6,LANIE>Now if we're done here, I gotta head back to the slab

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,240
<12-6,LANIE>看一具男尸
<12-6,LANIE>And see a man about a corpse.

355
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,590
<12-7,BECKETT>谢谢  帕里什医生  卡塞尔可被吓坏了
<12-7,BECKETT>Thank you, Dr. Parish. Castle was totally freaked out.

356
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,640
<12-8,CASTLE>想咬我  就得请客
<12-8,CASTLE>You want to bite me? You buy me dinner.

357
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,630
<12-9,BECKETT>洛克白先生
<12-9,BECKETT>Mr. Lockerby.

358
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,890
<12-9,BECKETT>摩洛克  认不认识克劳
<12-9,BECKETT>Morlock, do you know somebody named Crow?

359
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,290
<12-10,MORLOCK>狠毒的贱人  到处都是斑点
<12-10,MORLOCK>Heartless bitch! Spots all over.

360
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,080
<12-10,MORLOCK>全是斑点
<12-10,MORLOCK>S-spots all over.

361
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,530
<12-11,BECKETT>你当时和克劳在墓地吗
<12-11,BECKETT>Were you in the cemetery with Crow?

362
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,410
<12-12,MORLOCK>到处都是血  到处是血
<12-12,MORLOCK>Blood all over! Blood all over.

363
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,160
<12-13,BECKETT>杀手在场  洛克白先生
<12-13,BECKETT>There's been a murder, Mr. Lockerby.

364
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,600
<12-13,BECKETT>你明白吗
<12-13,BECKETT>Do you understand that?

365
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,820
<12-13,BECKETT>你有没有和克劳去墓地
<12-13,BECKETT>Were you in the cemetery with Crow?

366
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,360
<12-13,BECKETT>木钉上全是你的指纹
<12-13,BECKETT>We found a wooden stake with your fingerprints all over it.

367
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,400
<12-14,MORLOCK>那只猫爬进来把鸟杀了
<12-14,MORLOCK>Ah! The cat creeps in to kill the bird.

368
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,790
<12-14,MORLOCK>我该把你藏起来  可怜的孩子
<12-14,MORLOCK>I should've buried you then, wicked boy.

369
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,310
<12-14,MORLOCK>当时我该把你藏起来
<12-14,MORLOCK>I should've buried you then.

370
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,080
<12-14,MORLOCK>我没看见  看不到  看不到  看不到
<12-14,MORLOCK>Can--I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see.

371
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,810
<13-1,CASTLE>真不想教公共辩护人该怎么做
<13-1,CASTLE>I don't want to tell the public defender how to do her job,

372
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,130
<13-1,CASTLE>但我想说  精神病的证词可能有价值
<13-1,CASTLE>But I'm gonna say that the insanity plea might be appropriate.

373
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,430
<13-2,BECKETT>或许找个精神病医生  可以在他被带走之前
<13-2,BECKETT>Maybe the state psychiatrist can help us make sense

374
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,620
<13-2,BECKETT>帮我们弄懂摩洛克的疯话
<13-2,BECKETT>Out of Morlock's rantings before they take him away.

376
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,940
<13-3,CASTLE>好  谢谢
<13-3,CASTLE>Okay. Thanks.

377
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,420
<13-5,CASTLE>实验室打来的  他们告诉我
<13-5,CASTLE>That was the lab. They were calling me to tell me

378
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,830
<13-6,BECKETT>木钉上的墨点是印度墨水
<13-6,BECKETT>That the smudge on the stake was India ink.

379
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,490
<13-5,CASTLE>摩洛克经过垃圾桶时沾到的
<13-5,CASTLE>Morlock must have gotten some on his hands Going through a dumpster.

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,930
<13-4,BECKETT>-印度墨水  -对  怎么了
<13-4,BECKETT>- India ink? - Yeah. Why?

381
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,940
<13-3,CASTLE>印度还是中国墨水
<13-3,CASTLE>India ink, or Chinese ink,

382
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,740
<13-5,CASTLE>从公元前4000开始就使用墨水
<13-5,CASTLE>Has been used since 4th century B.C. when we've got nothing.

383
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,350
<13-5,CASTLE>它与水不互溶
<13-5,CASTLE>It's water resistent.

384
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,120
<13-5,CASTLE>所以上完色后不会弄脏
<13-5,CASTLE>So it won't smudge when colored over.

385
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,430
<13-5,CASTLE>漫画书对白的设计者使用墨水
<13-5,CASTLE>It's also the ink used by letterers in comic books.

386
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,200
<13-5,CASTLE>所以如果克劳画插画
<13-5,CASTLE>So if Crow was the illustrator...

387
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,000
<13-6,BECKETT>那么  他的朋友戴蒙写对白
<13-6,BECKETT>Then Crow's friend Daemon was the letterer.

388
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
<13-6,BECKETT>-可墨水怎么跑到木钉上  -这是问题所在
<13-6,BECKETT>- But what would the ink be doing on the stake? - What indeed.

389
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,070
<13-8,BECKETT>你们查出他那位朋友没有
<13-8,BECKETT>You guys, where are we on the friend?

390
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,100

<13-10,BECKETT>Yeah? Well, could you work a little faster?

392
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,560
<13-11,RYAN>-卡塞尔  帮个忙好吗  -乐意效劳
<13-11,RYAN>- Hey, castle, you wanna help? - I would love to,

393
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,900

398
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,470
<14-2,CASTLE>就是掌握好反面的效果
<14-2,CASTLE>Is understanding negative space.

399
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,390
<14-3,ALEXIS>不在于有什么  而在于没有什么
<14-3,ALEXIS>It's not what's there. It's what's not there.

400
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,790

<14-19,ALEXIS>The night before halloween-- By seniors.

418
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,140
<14-20,CASTLE>你奶奶的同学吗
<14-20,CASTLE>By your grandmother's friends?

419
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,370
<14-21,ALEXIS>不是  爸爸  十二年级的学生
<14-21,ALEXIS>No, dad. Twelfth graders.

420
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,570
<14-21,ALEXIS>不过  有老师在
<14-21,ALEXIS>But it'll be supervised.

421
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,280
<14-22,CASTLE>这是人生的十字路口  是吧
<14-22,CASTLE>This is one of those crossroads moments, isn't it?

422
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,450
<14-23,MARTHA>由她去吧
<14-23,MARTHA>Oh, let her go.

423
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,670
<14-23,MARTHA>她可比你那会儿懂事多了
<14-23,MARTHA>She's far more responsible than you ever were.

424
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,850
<14-24,CASTLE>好  你去吧
<14-24,CASTLE>Yes, you can go.

425
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,840
<14-24,CASTLE>但如果有任何不快
<14-24,CASTLE>But if anything happens that makes you feel uncomfortable,

426

<14-24,CASTLE>不管是什么事  打电话给我  无论发生什么
<14-24,CASTLE>Anything at all, you call me. I don't care what it is.

427
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,790
<14-24,CASTLE>我保证不罚你  也不指责你
<14-24,CASTLE>And there'll be no punishments, no recriminations,

428
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,650
<14-24,CASTLE>我保证  记得打电话就好
<14-24,CASTLE>Nothing, I promise, just so long as you call.

429
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,920
<14-25,ALEXIS>好  我会的  但不会出事的
<14-25,ALEXIS>Okay. Yeah, yeah, I will, I promise. But nothing's gonna happen.

430
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,500
<14-25,ALEXIS>-还有一件事  -什么
<14-25,ALEXIS>-But there's one more thing, though.- Yes.

431
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,090
<14-26,CASTLE>-能帮我照看费吉恩吗  -怎么  要孵小鸡了
<14-26,CASTLE>-Will you watch Feggin?  -Why, is he gonna hatch?

432
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,700
<14-28,CASTLE>不是  我们健康课的老师说  不能让它单独呆着
<14-28,CASTLE>No. Our health teacher says we can't leave him alone.

433
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,020
<14-29,ALEXIS>不然就是虐待蛋蛋
<14-29,ALEXIS>That's considered egg abuse.

434
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,360
<14-29,ALEXIS>我和佩吉要共同抚养
<14-29,ALEXIS>And since Paige and I are co-parenting,

435
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,320
<14-29,ALEXIS>可是  我们都要去参加派对
<14-29,ALEXIS>And we're both going to the party

436
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,700
<14-29,ALEXIS>她父母也要出门  就得找个保姆
<14-29,ALEXIS>And her parents are going out, we need a sitter.

437
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,790
<14-30,MARTHA>不好意思  我没空
<14-30,MARTHA>Oh, no. sorry. Uh, plans.

438
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,260
<14-31,CASTLE>好  没问题  我会看着你的鸡蛋宝宝的
<14-31,CASTLE>Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll watch your little egg child.

439
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,560
<14-31,CASTLE>但你得知道  做爷爷  我还太年轻了点
<14-31,CASTLE>But I want you to know, I'm far too young to be a grandparent.

440
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,500
<14-31,CASTLE>还有  如果有高年级男生骚扰你...
<14-31,CASTLE>And if, uh, any of those senior boys bother you...

441
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,920
<14-31,CASTLE>老爸我是绝不会姑息的
<14-31,CASTLE>Father won't be quite himself.

442
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,740
<14-31,CASTLE>他一直喃喃自语  大吼大叫  往栏杆上撞
<14-31,CASTLE>He mumbles, He shouts, he throws himself against the bars,

443
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,940
<15-1,BECKETT>不过也就如此而已
<15-1,BECKETT>But the's just something about it.

444
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,070
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>尽管像洛克白先生这样的人
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>Although someone like Mr. Lockerby

445
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,700
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>会表现得完全精神失常...
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>Will present as completely non compos mentis.

446
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,650
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>还是有清醒的时候
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>He could still have moments of lucidity.

447
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,650
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>问题就在于  如何区分幻觉与现实
<15-2,DR HOLLOWAY>The difficulty is separating the fantasy from the reality.

448
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,680
<15-3,BECKETT>这些都是受害者画的
<15-3,BECKETT>Well, these were drawn by our victim.

449
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,580
<15-3,BECKETT>我在想  这是不是在揭示着
<15-3,BECKETT>I was wondering if they suggested anything

450
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,630
<15-3,BECKETT>他跟洛克白先生的关系
<15-3,BECKETT>About his relationship with Mr. Lockerby.

451
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,100
<15-4,DR HOLLOWAY>我得继续研究下  才能得出诊断结果
<15-4,DR HOLLOWAY>I'd have to study them more to give you a diagnosis,

452
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,320
<15-4,DR HOLLOWAY>不过这跟那女的关系更大点
<15-4,DR HOLLOWAY>But these are more about the woman in the drawings

453
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,220
<15-5,BECKETT>-而不是洛克白先生  -什么意思
<15-5,BECKETT>-Than Lockerby.  - What do you mean?

454
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,860
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>他把她描绘成天使
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>He draws her as an angel,

455
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,680
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>但却总以暴力作为背景
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>But always in the context of an act of violence.

456
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,950
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>老实说  这更像是一个
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>Honestly? It looks to me like the work of someone

457
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,570
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>受过精神创伤的人的作品
<15-6,DR HOLLOWAY>Who was once traumatized.

458
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,450
<15-7,CASTLE>童年创伤  我说过的吧
<15-7,CASTLE>Childhood trauma. What'd I tell you?

459
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,230
<15-8,BECKETT>霍洛威医生 这位是理查德·卡塞尔
<15-8,BECKETT>Doc Holloway, this is Richard Castle.

460
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,640
<15-9,CASTLE>霍洛威医生  费吉恩快向这位心理专家问好
<15-9,CASTLE>Dr. Holloway. Say hello to the nice psychiatrist, Feggin.

461
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,380
<15-9,CASTLE>你好
<15-9,CASTLE>Hello.

462
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,410
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>我会安排
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>I will arrange for someone

463
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,460
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>社会服务处的义工来接洛克白先生
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>From social services to come get Mr. Lockerby.

464
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,770
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>你愿意的话  我也可以派人来接他
<15-10,DR HOLLOWAY>And if you want, I can have someone get him, too.

465
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,590
<15-11,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<15-11,BECKETT>Yes, please.

466
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,620
<15-12,CASTLE>你打算吃了它吗
<15-12,CASTLE>Are you gonna eat that?

467
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,810
<15-12,CASTLE>吃我的孙子  你当我是谁  大怪兽
<15-12,CASTLE>Eat my own grandchild? What am I, a monster?

468
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,490
<15-13,BECKETT>也许被咬了以后之后  你还真携带了啥病毒
<15-13,BECKETT>Maybe that bite was catching.

469
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,600
<15-14,CASTLE>这是学校的自然科学课
<15-14,CASTLE>It's a school health sciences project--

470
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,490
<15-14,CASTLE>在你学会承担责任之前
<15-14,CASTLE>Helping de-romanticize having a family

471
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,540
<15-14,CASTLE>先以浪漫化手法  组织一个家庭
<15-14,CASTLE>Before you're ready to take responsibility.

472
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,210
<15-14,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯和佩吉今晚初次参加高年级派对
<15-14,CASTLE>Alexis and Paige are going to their first senior party tonight,

473
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,960
<15-14,CASTLE>我就成了保姆  照顾鸡蛋宝宝
<15-14,CASTLE>So I'm babysitting. Egg-sitting.

474
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,050
<15-15,BECKETT>-高年级派对  -怎么了
<15-15,BECKETT>-Senior party, huh? -What?

475
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,420
<15-15,BECKETT>-贝克特  -我们给邻居们看了克鲁的照片
<15-15,BECKETT>- Beckett.  - We showed Crow's picture around the neighborhood.

476
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,230
<15-15,BECKETT>找到了他朋友戴蒙的线索
<15-15,BECKETT>We got a lead on his friend Daemon.

477
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,200
<15-15,BECKETT>说出来你都不会信  这家伙死了
<15-15,BECKETT>You're not gonna believe this. The guy is dead.

478
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,400
<15-15,BECKETT>一枪直接命中心脏而亡
<15-15,BECKETT>Shot right through the heart,

479
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
<15-15,BECKETT>住处也被人翻过了
<15-15,BECKETT>And his place has been tossed.

480
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,370
<15-15,BECKETT>另外说一下...
<15-15,BECKETT>Oh... and, uh...

481
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,160
<17-1,CASTLE>他是个狼人
<17-1,CASTLE>He's a werewolf.

482
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,900
<17-2,LANIE>-被银弹打死的  -不  9毫米子弹
<17-2,LANIE>- Silver bullet?   - No, 9 millimeter.

483
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,000
<17-3,CASTLE>-那我猜他不是真正的狼人  -对
<17-3,CASTLE>- Then I guess he's not a real werewolf.  - Nice.

484
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,880
<17-4,LANIE>他脸上手上的毛发  都是人造的
<17-4,LANIE>The hairs on his face and hands are synthetic,

485
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,220
<17-4,LANIE>用化妆胶水粘上去的  万圣节装扮
<17-4,LANIE>Attached with spirit gum. It's a halloween costume.

486
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,940
<17-5,ESPOSITO>从他的驾照来看
<17-5,ESPOSITO>According to his driver's license,

487
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,370
<17-5,ESPOSITO>戴蒙真名叫乔纳斯·维斯特福尔
<17-5,ESPOSITO>Daemon's real name was Jonas Westfall.

<17-5,ESPOSITO>毕业于纽约大学  法医人类学专业
<17-5,ESPOSITO>He's a graduate student N.Y.U. In forensic anthropology.

489
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,750
<17-6,CASTLE>所以会有这么多骨头
<17-6,CASTLE>Then that explains the bones.

490
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,240
<17-8,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  别碰  -我知道
<17-8,CASTLE>- Castle, don't touch.  - I know.

491
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,150
<17-9,RYAN>我们细查了这栋楼
<17-9,RYAN>Canvassed the building.

492
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,760
<17-9,RYAN>邻居们那天听些动静
<17-9,RYAN>Neighbor remembers hearing something the other day

493
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,870
<17-9,RYAN>-万圣节那天还有车来过  -那天
<17-9,RYAN>- But there was a car back in Hallowmas - Tht other day?

494
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,010
<17-11,LANIE>根据尸体的腐化和瘀青程度
<17-11,LANIE>Based on deterioration and lividity

495
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,200
<17-11,LANIE>还有那泰国菜的馊味
<17-11,LANIE>And the smell of that old Thai food,

496
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,010
<17-11,LANIE>这狼人跟咱们那吸血鬼  是同一天被杀的
<17-11,LANIE>Wolf boy was killed the same day as our vampire.

497
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,150
<17-11,LANIE>可以说  比他还早几小时
<17-11,LANIE>I'd say a couple of hours before.

498
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,750
<17-13,LANIE>莱恩  查查送外卖的人
<17-13,LANIE>Ryan, track down the delivery guy.

499
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,100
<17-16,CASTLE>查查外卖送达的时间
<17-16,CASTLE>Find out when this was delivered

500
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,300
<17-18,LANIE>还有  当时有没有别人在场
<17-18,LANIE>And whether anyone else was up here when he brought it.

501
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,870
<17-21,CASTLE>以另外个自己  过来参加
<17-21,CASTLE>"Come as your alter ego"?

502
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,470
<17-23,LANIE>10月27日晚7点  他本打算参加这个派对
<17-23,LANIE>"October 27th at 7:00 p.m." our guy was going to this party.

503
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,950
<17-11,LANIE>即克鲁被害的同一天
<17-11,LANIE>Same day that Crow was killed.

504
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,410
<17-13,LANIE>我认为二者有关连
<17-13,LANIE>I assume there's a connection.

505
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,760
<17-13,LANIE>印度墨水
<17-13,LANIE>India ink,

506
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,350
<17-14,CASTLE>也就是说  杀克鲁的凶手也来过这
<17-14,CASTLE>Which means Crow's killer was in the apartment, too.

507
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,350
<17-15,BECKETT>但他们到底在找什么呢
<17-15,BECKETT>But what were they looking for?

508
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,280
<18-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<18-13,BECKETT>Castle.

509
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,340
<17-14,CASTLE>莫洛克
<17-14,CASTLE>Morlock?

510
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,320
<17-15,BECKETT>他来这  打杀了戴蒙  拿走木钉
<17-15,BECKETT>He comes here, shoots Daemon, grabs a stake

511
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,740
<17-16,CASTLE>又去害克鲁
<17-16,CASTLE>Goes off and kills Crow.

512
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,720
<17-17,BECKETT>扭打中打碎了墨水瓶
<17-17,BECKETT>And in the struggle, the ink bottle is broken.

513
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,220
<17-18,LANIE>不会是莫洛克  这名受害者是白天被杀的
<17-18,LANIE>Wasn't Morlock. This victim was killed during the day.

514
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,790
<17-18,LANIE>莫洛克有卟啉症  他不能见阳光的
<17-18,LANIE>Morlock had porphyria. He would've burnt to a crisp.

515
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,960
<17-19,CASTLE>如果这狼人不是他杀的
<17-19,CASTLE>So if he didn't kill our werewolf...

516
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,990
<17-20,BECKETT>也有可能  吸血鬼也不是他杀的
<17-20,BECKETT>Then chances are he didn't kill our vempire.

517
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,830
<17-21,CASTLE>那木钉上怎么会有他的指纹
<17-21,CASTLE>Well, then how did the prints get on the stake?

518
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,790
<17-22,BECKETT>也许  他是想帮忙
<17-22,BECKETT>Maybe he was trying to help him.

519
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,320
<17-22,BECKETT>也许就是想救朋友
<17-22,BECKETT>Maybe he was trying to save his friend.

520
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,570
<17-22,BECKETT>死亡时间你能确定吗
<17-22,BECKETT>Are you sure about the time of death?

521
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,650
<17-23,LANIE>他摔倒的时候手表停了  10月27日4点
<17-23,LANIE>His watch broke when he fell. It says 4:00, october 27th.

522
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,850
<17-24,BECKETT>如果凶手不是莫洛克  会是谁呢
<17-24,BECKETT>Well, then if it wasn't Morlock, who was it?

523
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,360
<17-25,CASTLE>他们又在找什么呢
<17-25,CASTLE>And what were they looking for?

524
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,290
<17-26,LANIE>虽然不知道他们在找什么
<17-26,LANIE>Uh... I don't know what they were looking for,

525
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,810
<17-26,LANIE>但我知道受害者在藏什么
<17-26,LANIE>But I think I know what our vic was hiding.

526
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,760
<17-26,LANIE>那就是说乔纳斯·维斯特福尔  又名戴蒙
<17-26,LANIE>So Jonas Westfall, A.K.A. Daemon,

527
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,950
<18-1,BECKETT>即将获得纽约大学
<18-1,BECKETT>Was inches away from getting his master's

<18-1,BECKETT>法医学硕士学位
<18-1,BECKETT>In Forensic Science from N.Y.Y.

529
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,830
<18-2,CASTLE>这看来都是他研究的一部分
<18-2,CASTLE>This all looks like part of his research.

530
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,020
<18-2,CASTLE>我小时候也曾热衷收集骨头
<18-2,CASTLE>I went through a bone collecting phase When I was a kid.

531
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,660
<18-3,BECKETT>你小时候肯定经历过什么
<18-3,BECKETT>So whatever happened to you happened when you were young.

532
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,890
<18-3,BECKETT>什么事  卡塞尔  你看到过谋杀吗
<18-3,BECKETT>What was it, Castle? Did you witness a murder?

533
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,710
<18-3,BECKETT>还是膝盖擦破流了血
<18-3,BECKETT>Or did you skin your knee and it bled?

534
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,260
<18-4,CASTLE>说到精神创伤
<18-4,CASTLE>Hmm. Speaking of trauma,

535
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,640
<18-4,CASTLE>不知道阿丽克西斯会在派对玩到多晚
<18-4,CASTLE>I wonder how late Alexis is gonna be at her party.

536
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,580
<18-4,CASTLE>可怜的费吉恩  正遭受着离别的痛苦
<18-4,CASTLE>Poor Feggin is suffering from separation issues.

537
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,250
<18-5,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  我的情况你全知道  礼尚往来
<18-5,BECKETT>Come on, Castle.You know mine. Tit for tat.

538
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,550
<18-6,CASTLE>我收了你的礼
<18-6,CASTLE>Just because I've seen your tat

539
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,120
<18-6,CASTLE>不代表非得还礼
<18-6,CASTLE>Doesn't mean I'm gonna show you my...

540
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,450
<18-6,CASTLE>看看这个  两年前
<18-6,CASTLE>Check this out. Uh, dated two years ago--

541
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,680
<18-7,BECKETT>周日深夜  在利哈伊河上游的宾州森林
<18-7,BECKETT>"A murdered woman was unearthed in the pennsylvania woods

542
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,220
<18-7,BECKETT>发现一名女子被害  调查表明
<18-7,BECKETT>"Above Lehigh river late sunday night. "Investigators say

543
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,460
<18-8,CASTLE>-该女子埋在浅墓好几年了  -还有吗
<18-8,CASTLE>- She'd been buried in the shallow grave for years."  -And?

544
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,520
<18-8,CASTLE>根据遗体残骸  调查人员已经成功
<18-8,CASTLE>"Based on the remains, investigators have attempted

545
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,730
<18-8,CASTLE>将被害女子的脸部进行了法医学复原
<18-8,CASTLE>A forensic reconstruction of the murdered woman's face."

546
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,280
<18-9,BECKETT>那就是克鲁画中的女人
<18-9,BECKETT>That's the woman from Crow's drawings.

547
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,950
<18-10,CASTLE>然而在小说的插画中
<18-10,CASTLE>Yet in the graphic novel,

548
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,760
<18-10,CASTLE>她一直化身成死亡天使
<18-10,CASTLE>She consistently appears as the Angel of Death.

549
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,940
<18-11,BECKETT>好  既然克鲁着迷于戴蒙的案例研究
<18-11,BECKETT>Okay, so Crow became obsessed with Daemon's case study.

550
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,770
<18-11,BECKETT>为何要费尽周折藏起来呢
<18-11,BECKETT>Why would they go to this much trouble to hide it?

551
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,480
<18-12,CASTLE>为何有人为了找出来不惜杀人呢
<18-12,CASTLE>Why would someone kill to find it?

552
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,790
<18-12,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -嗯
<18-12,CASTLE>-Castle. -Hmm?

553
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,110
<18-13,BECKETT>这些草图是四年前画的
<18-13,BECKETT>These sketches were drawn four years ago.

554
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,460
<18-14,CASTLE>不可能
<18-14,CASTLE>No, no that's impossible.

555
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,740
<18-14,CASTLE>尸体是两年前才发现的
<18-14,CASTLE>This body wasn't discovered until two years ago.

556
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,700
<18-15,BECKETT>除非克鲁能通灵  不然就是...
<18-15,BECKETT>So either Crow is psychic or...

557
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,810
<18-16,CASTLE>在该女子被害之前 他就认识她
<18-16,CASTLE>Or he knew this woman before she died.

558
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,160
<18-16,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你怎样  都还好吧

560
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,640
<18-17,ALEXIS>我认为庞趣酒有问题  而且她喝太多了
<18-17,ALEXIS>I think the Punch is spiked, and she had too much to drink.

561
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,340
<18-18,CASTLE>我怕她会出事
<18-18,CASTLE>I'm afraid something's gonna happen to her.

562
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,560
<18-18,CASTLE>马上到
<18-18,CASTLE>I'm on my way.

<19-2,ALEXIS>我不知道  她不亲人家就得喝酒
<19-2,ALEXIS>I don't know. She was swapping drinks for kisses,

565
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,420
<19-2,ALEXIS>我想拉她走  可她不让
<19-2,ALEXIS>And I tried to pull her away, but she wouldn't let me.

566
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,570
<19-3,CASTLE>给我杯水
<19-3,CASTLE>Would you get me a glass of water?

567
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,590
<19-5,ALEXIS>-阿丽克西斯  别拉我  -佩吉
<19-5,ALEXIS>- Leave me alone, Alexis. - Paige.

568
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,090
<19-6,CASTLE>你确信她没吐或失去意识吗
<19-6,CASTLE>Now you're sure she hasn't been throwing up or unconscious?

569
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,060
<19-8,CASTLE>-没  躺下吧  -好吧  打电话给她父母

<19-10,CASTLE>-她在说什么  -醉话
<19-10,CASTLE>- What is she saying? - It's just drunk talk.

573
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,190
<19-11,ALEXIS>她说不要打电话给她的父母   否则他们会杀了她的
<19-11,ALEXIS>She says don't call her parents or they'll murder her.

574
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,990
<19-11,ALEXIS>就让她借宿一晚  非得联络她父母吗
<19-11,ALEXIS>Just let her sleep over. Do we have to call her parents?

577
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,980
<19-14,CASTLE>总比你让她借宿强
<19-14,CASTLE>Less than if you had left her there.

578
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,400
<19-14,CASTLE>快点
<19-14,CASTLE>Now.

<20-1,JANICE FREEMAN>Adora. That's what he called her.

581
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,310
<20-1,JANICE FREEMAN>我们在马修的作品中见过她很多年了
<20-1,JANICE FREEMAN>We've seen her in matthew's artwork for years.

583
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,320
<20-2,ALAN FREEMAN>我们当她是虚构的人物
<20-2,ALAN FREEMAN>We just assumed that she was a figment of his imagination.

584
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,130
<20-3,ROSIE FREEMAN>他说她是自己的灵魂
<20-3,ROSIE FREEMAN>He called her his own personal ghost.

585
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,910
<20-3,ROSIE FREEMAN>无论是他的梦境还是恶梦里都有她
<20-3,ROSIE FREEMAN>He said she appeared in his dreams and nightmares.

586
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,900
<20-4,BECKETT>她并非虚构  确有其人
<20-4,BECKETT>Well, she's not a figment. She's very real.

587

<20-4,BECKETT>你们确信不认识她
<20-4,BECKETT>Are you sure you don't recognize her?

588
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,990
<20-4,BECKETT>因为她可能是任何人
<20-4,BECKETT>Because she could be anybody.

589
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,080
<20-4,BECKETT>可能是一名老师  你的邻居
<20-4,BECKETT>She could be a teacher, a neighbor.

590
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,990
<20-5,JANICE FREEMAN>肯定不认识  只在他作品中见过
<20-5,JANICE FREEMAN>No, I-I'm certain. We've only seen her in his art.

<20-8,BECKETT>给一位临床医学家看过  他说看起来
<20-8,BECKETT>To one of our therapists, and he said that it looked like

595
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,890
<20-8,BECKETT>他可能目睹过一些烦心事
<20-8,BECKETT>He might have witnessed something disturbing,

<20-9,JANICE FREEMAN>I-I really can't think of anything.

598

<21-7,ESPOSITO>From a 9-millimeter handgun, same as Daemon.

615
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,480
<21-7,ESPOSITO>我就想  怎么回事  经过弹道对比
<21-7,ESPOSITO>So I thought, what the hell? Compare the ballistics.

616
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:37,340
<21-7,ESPOSITO>两颗子弹...完全吻合
<21-7,ESPOSITO>The bullets... are a match.

617
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:39,480
<21-8,BECKETT>两起谋杀相隔这么多年
<21-8,BECKETT>Two murders that many years apart?

618
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,780
<21-8,BECKETT>神秘女子还有什么线索吗
<21-8,BECKETT>Anything on the mystery woman?

619
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,470
<21-9,ESPOSITO>还是无法确定身份
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Mnh-mnh. still haven't I.D.'ed her.

620
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,940
<21-10,BECKETT>该女子被杀时
<21-10,BECKETT>You know, Crow would've been 2 years old

621
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,670
<21-10,BECKETT>克鲁应该才两岁
<21-10,BECKETT>When that woman was killed.

622
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,580
<21-10,BECKETT>你还记得两岁时发生的事吗
<21-10,BECKETT>Do you remember anything from when you were that young?

624
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,960
<21-12,BECKETT>-克鲁的公文包  -对
<21-12,BECKETT>- Crow's portfolio? - Yeah.

625
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,510
<21-11,RYAN>有好东西给你看看
<21-11,RYAN>And there's something you gotta see.

626
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,890
<21-10,BECKETT>眼熟吧
<21-10,BECKETT>Look familiar?

627
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,530
<21-8,BECKETT>同一棵树  跟找到尸体旁的那棵一样
<21-8,BECKETT>It's the same tree, Just like where the body was found.

628
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,220
<21-7,ESPOSITO>梦境不可能画得如此精确
<21-7,ESPOSITO>You don't draw something with that precision from a dream.

629
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,930
<21-6,BECKETT>那是他的记忆
<21-6,BECKETT>He's remembering it.

630
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,580
<21-4,BECKETT>克鲁亲眼目睹了那名女子被杀
<21-4,BECKETT>Crow witnessed that woman's murder

631
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,240
<21-3,ESPOSITO>当时他才2岁
<21-3,ESPOSITO>When he was 2 years old.

632
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,490
<21-2,BECKETT>应该和别人在一起
<21-2,BECKETT>He had to have been with someone--

633
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,930
<21-2,BECKETT>保姆  家人或者是凶手
<21-2,BECKETT>A sitter or a family member or maybe even the killer.

634
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,290
<22-1,RYAN>调查一下弗雷曼家族的背景
<22-1,RYAN>Run a background check on the Freemans.

635
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,320
<22-2,BECKETT>看看18年前他们住哪里
<22-2,BECKETT>Find out where they were living 18 years ago.

636
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,000
<22-3,ESPOSITO>没问题
<22-3,ESPOSITO>You got it.

637
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,430
<22-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  阿丽克西斯还好吧
<22-4,BECKETT>Hey, Castle. Alexis okay?

638
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,360
<22-5,CASTLE>她...她是个很聪明的孩子
<22-5,CASTLE>She's, uh... she's a smart kid.

639
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,300
<22-5,CASTLE>你照看了费吉恩
<22-5,CASTLE>You took care of Feggin.

640
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,330
<22-5,CASTLE>对  伺候他不难
<22-5,CASTLE>Yeah, well, he was... easy.

641
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,800
<22-5,CASTLE>我把他放床上  他都没闹
<22-5,CASTLE>He didn't even fuss when I put him to bed.

642
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,090
<22-5,CASTLE>想知道更多这个离奇案件的消息吗
<22-5,CASTLE>Yo. Ready for more tales of the weird and strangely odd?

643
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,040
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>我们调查了弗雷曼家族的过去
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>We looked into the Freeman family history.

644
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,220
<25-2,BECKETT>弗雷曼是詹尼斯娘家的姓
<25-2,BECKETT>Freeman is Janice's maiden name.

645
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,330
<22-6,BECKETT>当她和艾伦结婚后  艾伦用了她的姓
<22-6,BECKETT>When she and Alan got married, Alan took her name

646
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,630
<22-7,ESPOSITO>马修也是
<22-7,ESPOSITO>And so did Matthew.

647
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,510
<22-8,CASTLE>要么他就是主张男女平等
<22-8,CASTLE>Well, he's either a feminist

648
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,950
<22-8,CASTLE>要么就是有所隐藏
<22-8,CASTLE>Or he's hiding something.

649
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,990
<22-9,BECKETT>-艾伦原来姓是什么  -麦金蒂
<22-9,BECKETT>-  What's Alan's original last name?  -  Maginty.

650
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,990
<22-10,RYAN>我觉得他是在隐藏什么
<22-10,RYAN>And I think he was hiding something.

651
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,010
<22-10,RYAN>艾伦的前妻  伊丽莎白·麦金蒂
<22-10,RYAN>Alan's first wife, Elizabeth Mcginty,

652
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,080
<22-10,RYAN>18年前在新泽西的山峰市失踪了
<22-10,RYAN>Went missing from Summit, New Jersey, 18 years ago.

653
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,680
<22-10,RYAN>从此杳无音信
<22-10,RYAN>She was never found.

654
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,180
<22-11,BECKETT>艾伦没说实话  他很清楚儿子在画谁
<22-11,BECKETT>Alan lied to us. He knew exactly who his son was drawing.

655
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,530
<22-11,BECKETT>画的就是亲生母亲
<22-11,BECKETT>He was drawing his real mother.

656
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,100
<22-12,ESPOSITO>从案发地点到山峰市只需几个小时
<22-12,ESPOSITO>And Summit's only a couple of hours from where the body was found.

657
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,090
<22-13,CASTLE>伊丽莎白·麦金蒂  原姓德莱顿  德莱顿
<22-13,CASTLE>Elizabeth Mcginty, maiden name Dryden. Dryden?

658
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,550
<22-14,BECKETT>-伊丽莎白·德莱顿  -怎么啦
<22-14,BECKETT>-  Elizabeth dryden. -  What?

659
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,540
<22-15,CASTLE>那个没有死亡日期的  还记得我说的
<22-15,CASTLE>Question mark. Remember what I told you

660
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,290
<22-15,CASTLE>那个墓碑的事吗
<22-15,CASTLE>About gravestones telling stories?

661
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,440
<23-1,BECKETT>克鲁是有目的而来的
<23-1,BECKETT>Crow came here for a reason.

662
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,260
<23-2,ESPOSITO>墓地管理人员说这家人
<23-2,ESPOSITO>So cemetery management said that the family

663
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,920
<23-2,ESPOSITO>为女儿举行了追悼会
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Had a memorial service for their daughter

664
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,800
<23-2,ESPOSITO>大约在她失踪五年后
<23-2,ESPOSITO>About five years after she went missing.

665
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,510
<23-3,BECKETT>戴蒙为了完成他的作品肯定看过无数张
<23-3,BECKETT>Daemon must have looked at hundreds of

666
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,430
<23-3,BECKETT>被重塑后的脸
<23-3,BECKETT>Reconstructed faces researching his thesis.

667
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,520
<23-3,BECKETT>很难想象  当他在克鲁的作品中认出
<23-3,BECKETT>I can't imagine the shock when he recognized one

668
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,900
<23-3,BECKETT>这个女人会有多么震惊
<23-3,BECKETT>As the woman from Crow's drawings.

669
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,640
<23-4,CASTLE>克鲁一定意识到
<23-4,CASTLE>And Crow must have realized

670
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,810
<23-4,CASTLE>多年来  家人一直让他蒙在鼓里
<23-4,CASTLE>His family had been lying to him all these years.

671
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,470
<23-5,BECKETT>她的坟上有鲜花
<23-5,BECKETT>Huh. Fresh flowers on her grave.

672
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,510
<23-6,CASTLE>克鲁把父亲带到了这里
<23-6,CASTLE>Crow grabbed his father here

673
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,100
<23-6,CASTLE>在母亲的坟前与他对质
<23-6,CASTLE>To confront him with his mother's grave.

674
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,190
<23-6,CASTLE>多年来  明知道儿子在画自己的母亲
<23-6,CASTLE>All of these years, You knew your son was drawing his mother,

675
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,160
<24-1,BECKETT>却对此绝口不提
<24-1,BECKETT>And you never said anything.

676
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,660
<24-2,ALAN FREEMAN>我在保护我的家人
<24-2,ALAN FREEMAN>I was protecting my family

677
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,320
<24-3,BECKETT>你在保护你自己
<24-3,BECKETT>You were protecting yourself.

678
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,700
<24-3,BECKETT>你这个冷血的凶手
<24-3,BECKETT>You're a cold-blooded killer.

679
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,460
<24-3,BECKETT>杀害妻子后谎报失踪
<24-3,BECKETT>You killed your wife, and then reported her missing,

680
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,280
<24-3,BECKETT>却不料被儿子在18年后发觉
<24-3,BECKETT>And then 18 years later when your son found out,

681
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,170
<24-3,BECKETT>于是再杀掉儿子
<24-3,BECKETT>You killed him as well.

682
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,200
<24-4,LAWSON>你不必作答
<24-4,LAWSON>You don't have to respond to that.

683
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>不行  她指控我杀了自己的儿子
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>No, no, no, no. She's accusing me of killing my son.

684
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,620
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>我确实骗了马修  不过只想保护他
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>Yes, I lied to Matthew, but I did it to protect him.

685
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,430
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>他那时太小  理解不了
<24-5,ALAN FREEMAN>I thought he was too young to understand

686
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,010
<24-6,BECKETT>-你当时有嫌疑  -肯定有嫌疑
<24-6,BECKETT>-  You were a suspect  -  Of course I was a suspect.

687
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:30,850
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>我是她的丈夫
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>I was her husband.

688
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,640
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>可没有证据表明  我与她的失踪有关
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>There wasn't any evidence that tied me to her disappearance

689
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,510
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>我与此确实无关
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>'cause I had nothing to do with it.

690
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,120
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>詹尼斯和我的结合是一种转机
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>When Janice and I got married, it was like a chance...

691
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,200
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>开始新生活的转机
<24-7,ALAN FREEMAN>A chance at a fresh start.

692
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,230
<24-8,CASTLE>得到了法律允许
<24-8,CASTLE>And so as soon as you were legally able,

693
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,010
<24-8,CASTLE>你就另结新欢
<24-8,CASTLE>You married your Nanny.

694
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,290
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>那段暗淡的岁月中  詹尼斯一直陪在我们身边
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>Janice was there for us during a very dark time in our lives.

695
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,460
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>门口都是记者
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>We had press on the lawn.

696
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,980
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>好几天不得安歇
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>There were days without sleep.

697
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,530
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>我到处散发利兹[伊丽莎白的昵称]的寻人启事
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>I was handing out flyers with Lizzy's picture on it.

698
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,210
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>詹尼斯整理材料  还来照看马修
<24-9,ALAN FREEMAN>And Janice kept it together, and she protected Matthew.

699
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,090
<24-10,BECKETT>那你为什么要对我们撒谎
<24-10,BECKETT>Then why would you lie to us?

700
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,770
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>当时我女儿也在场
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>You told us in front of our daughter.

701
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,430
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>我能怎么办
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>What did you want me to do,

702
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,330
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>告诉她其实一切都是谎言
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>Tell her that everything she thought was a lie?

703
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,410
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>罗茜崇拜马修  才知道他的死讯
<24-11,ALAN FREEMAN>Rosie adored matthew. She had just found out he died.

704
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,500
<24-12,CASTLE>-你会怎么做  -我会告诉她真相
<24-12,CASTLE>-  What would you have done?  -  I would've told her the truth.

705
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,410
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>他第一次画他妈妈的时候才9岁
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>He was 9 years old when he first drew her face.

706
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,600
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>当他拿给我看时  我以为撞鬼了
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>He showed it to me. I thought I was seeing a ghost.

707
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,340
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>我想  孩子对母亲
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>I figured... she was still somewhere

708
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,360
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>仍然有些早期的记忆
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>In his head from his earlier memories.

709
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,470
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>可谎言说多也渐渐变成了事实
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>But we'd been living a lie for so long. It had become the truth

710
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,900
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>我怎么能告诉他  詹尼斯不是他的母亲
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>So how can I possibly tell him Janice wasn't his mather

711
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,360
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>他的生母已经过世呢
<24-13,ALAN FREEMAN>That his real mother ran away?

712
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,440
<24-14,LAWSON>问完了吗  警探
<24-14,LAWSON>Are we through here, detective?

713
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,950
<24-15,BECKETT>休想用这样的理由蒙混过去
<24-15,BECKETT>Not by a long shot, lawson.

714
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,480
<24-15,BECKETT>康涅狄格州的警察

<24-15,BECKETT>Found a 9-millimeter handgun in your client's home,

716
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,490
<24-15,BECKETT>我敢肯定  这把枪杀死了
<24-15,BECKETT>And I am just betting that that is the same gun that killed

717
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,160
<24-15,BECKETT>伊丽莎白·德莱顿·麦金蒂和乔纳斯·维斯特福尔
<24-15,BECKETT>Elizabeth Dryden Mcginty and Jonas Westfall.

<24-16,LAWSON>-  No, I  -  Don't say anything, Alan.

<24-17,BECKETT>是吗  再看看这个
<24-17,BECKETT>Oh, yeah. and there's also this.

720
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,180
<24-17,BECKETT>你儿子目睹了他母亲被杀的过程
<24-17,BECKETT>Your son witnessed his mother's murder.

721
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,690
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>不  那不可能
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>No. That's not possible.

722
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,490
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>这...这怎么可能
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>How... how is this possible?

723
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,860
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>拿一下  谢谢
<24-18,ALAN FREEMAN>Here. thank you.

724
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,950
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>劳驾
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>Excuse me.

725
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,970
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>你们打算让我们
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>Um, how much longer are you people gonna keep us waiting

726
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,200
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>在毫不知情的情况下  等上多久啊
<25-1,JANICE FREEMAN>Without letting us know what is going on?

727
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,150
<25-2,BECKETT>我们正在努力调查  弗雷曼太太
<25-2,BECKETT>We are trying to find the answers, Mrs. Freeman.

728
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,430
<25-3,CASTLE>-斑点  -什么
<25-3,CASTLE>-  Spots  -  what?

729
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,720
<25-4,BECKETT>到处都是斑点  到处是血
<25-4,BECKETT>"Spots all over. Blood all over.

730
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,650
<25-5,CASTLE>我该把你藏起来  可怜的孩子
<25-5,CASTLE>I should've buried you then, you wicked boy."

731
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,430
<25-6,BECKETT>-你在说什么  -摩洛克的疯话
<25-6,BECKETT>-  What are you talking about?  -  Morlock's crazy talk.

732
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,890
<25-7,CASTLE>就像佩奇的酒后呓语  你得仔细体会
<25-7,CASTLE>It's just like Paige's drunk talk. You have to translate it.

733
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,180
<25-7,CASTLE>-摩洛克还关着吗  -关着呢
<25-7,CASTLE>-  Is morlock still in holding?  -  Yeah.

734
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
<25-9,CASTLE>弗雷曼太太  很抱歉耽误您这么久
<25-9,CASTLE>Mrs. Freeman, I am so sorry this is taking so long.

735
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,630
<25-9,CASTLE>但既然还要继续等
<25-9,CASTLE>But as long as you have to wait,

736
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,670
<25-9,CASTLE>你应该也想让自己更舒适一点
<25-9,CASTLE>You might as well be comfortable.

737
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,170
<25-9,CASTLE>看到自动贩卖机了吗
<25-9,CASTLE>Have you seen our vending machines?

738
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,900
<25-9,CASTLE>一直往前走  然后左拐
<25-9,CASTLE>Uh, straight through here. Right. Just to the left here.

739
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,030
<25-10,MORLOCK>对了  就在那里  很好  一直往前
<25-10,MORLOCK>Perfect. Right in there. Excellent. Straight through.

740
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,520
<25-10,MORLOCK>噢  错了  转身
<25-10,MORLOCK>Oh, wrong. Turn--

741
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,610
<25-10,MORLOCK>啊  狠毒的贱人  你杀死了克鲁
<25-10,MORLOCK>aah! heartless bitch! Spots murdered the Crow!

742
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,870
<25-10,MORLOCK>凶手  凶手
<25-10,MORLOCK>Murderer! Murderer!

743
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,160
<25-11,CASTLE>世界可真小啊
<25-11,CASTLE>What a small world.

744
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,100
<26-1,BECKETT>-拿好  -谢谢
<26-1,BECKETT>-  Here you go  -  Thank you.

745
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,370
<26-2,ALAN FREEMAN>怎么回事
<26-2,ALAN FREEMAN>Why?

746
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:41,090
<26-3,BECKETT>她杀死了伊丽莎白  从而得到你
<26-3,BECKETT>She killed elizabeth so that she could have you to herself.

747
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,830
<26-3,BECKETT>然后又杀了马修和他的朋友戴蒙
<26-3,BECKETT>And then she murdered Matthew and his friend Daemon

748
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,520
<26-3,BECKETT>那样你就永远不会知道了
<26-3,BECKETT>So that you would never find out.

749
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,060
<26-3,BECKETT>马修不知道该相信谁
<26-3,BECKETT>Matthew didn't know who to trust,

750
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,530
<26-3,BECKETT>于是让戴蒙帮他收藏证据
<26-3,BECKETT>So he asked Daemon to hide the evidence,

751
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,540
<26-3,BECKETT>却没料到她要精明得多
<26-3,BECKETT>Which ended up being smarter than he ever realized.

752
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,250
<26-3,BECKETT>她知道他们早晚会查出真相
<26-3,BECKETT>She knew that it was only a matter of time

753
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,020
<26-3,BECKETT>发现她的罪行
<26-3,BECKETT>Before they figured out the truth about what she had done.

754
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:02,100
<26-3,BECKETT>于是她跟踪戴蒙回家  打死了他
<26-3,BECKETT>So she followed Daemon to his apartment and shot him.

755
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,900
<26-3,BECKETT>那把枪也是杀死你前妻的凶器
<26-3,BECKETT>She used the same gun that she used to kill your first wife.

756
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,220
<26-4,ALAN FREEMAN>那我儿子呢
<26-4,ALAN FREEMAN>What about my son?

757
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,710
<26-4,ALAN FREEMAN>他当时是要去墓地
<26-4,ALAN FREEMAN>He was on his way to the cemetery to, uh...

758
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,630
<26-5,BECKETT>给他母亲献花
<26-5,BECKETT>Lay down flowers at his mother's grave.

759
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,650
<26-5,BECKETT>当她看到戴蒙家的木钉后
<26-5,BECKETT>And when she saw the stakes in Daemon's apartment,

760
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,820
<26-5,BECKETT>就想到把罪名推给
<26-5,BECKETT>She figured that she could lay blame

761
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,460
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>那些在你儿子身边而不招你待见的人
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>On the people in your son's life that you already hated.

762
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,600
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>她把他养大
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>She raised him.

763
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,220
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>就像他的母亲一样
<26-6,ALAN FREEMAN>She was like his mother.

764
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,550
<26-7,BECKETT>他让她经常想起她的罪行
<26-7,BECKETT>He was a constant reminder of what she had done.

765
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,730
<26-7,BECKETT>当他离开她时
<26-7,BECKETT>And when he turned on her...

766
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,130
<26-7,BECKETT>她就不再是他母亲了
<26-7,BECKETT>She wasn't his mother anymore.

767
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,270
<26-7,BECKETT>-爸爸  -宝贝
<26-7,BECKETT>-  Daddy!  -  Oh, sweetie.

768
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,490
<27-1,ROSIE FREEMAN>没事了
<27-1,ROSIE FREEMAN>It's--it's okay.

769
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,850
<27-2,ALAN FREEMAN>会好的  没事了
<27-2,ALAN FREEMAN>It's gonna be fine. It's okay.

770
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,700
<27-3,CASTLE>希望这事不会给她留下阴影
<27-3,CASTLE>I hope this doesn't destroy her.

771
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,450
<27-4,BECKETT>需要一段时间  然后某天  她会走出阴影
<27-4,BECKETT>It will for a little while. And then one day, she'll wake up

772
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,240
<27-4,BECKETT>将其变成生命中的小插曲
<27-4,BECKETT>And it'll just be a part of her life.

773
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,270
<27-4,BECKETT>谁知道呢  可能她会成为作家
<27-4,BECKETT>Who knows? Maybe she'll become a writer

774
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,420
<27-5,CASTLE>或者警察
<27-5,CASTLE>Or a cop.

775
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,710
<27-6,BECKETT>对了  你还没告诉我
<27-6,BECKETT>You know, you still haven't told me

776
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,960
<27-6,BECKETT>你为什么对谋杀着迷
<27-6,BECKETT>Where your fascination with murder came from.

777
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,600
<27-7,CASTLE>我5岁时  当时在海波汀避暑
<27-7,CASTLE>I was five years old. We were summering in the Haptains.

778
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,830
<27-7,CASTLE>我可以自由活动
<27-7,CASTLE>I was pretty much left to my own devices

779
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,590
<27-7,CASTLE>一天  我沿着沙滩走
<27-7,CASTLE>This one day, I was walking along the beach.

780
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,510
<27-7,CASTLE>走出几英里远
<27-7,CASTLE>I was miles from where I had started.

781
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,930
<27-7,CASTLE>正准备回去的时候
<27-7,CASTLE>I was just about to turn back

782
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,650
<27-7,CASTLE>看到什么东西被冲上岸来
<27-7,CASTLE>When I saw something had washed up on the beach.

783
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,600
<27-7,CASTLE>我以为是鲨鱼  海龟或海狮
<27-7,CASTLE>I thought, maybe it's a-a whale Or a turtle or a sea lion.

784
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,660
<27-7,CASTLE>我便跑过去看
<27-7,CASTLE>So I ran over to see what it was.

785
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,540
<27-8,BECKETT>是什么
<27-8,BECKETT>What was it?

786
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:59,640
<27-9,CASTLE>是个男孩  跟我一样大
<27-9,CASTLE>It was a boy... my age.

787
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,190
<27-9,CASTLE>是我们管家的儿子
<27-9,CASTLE>It was our housekeeper's son.

788
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,160
<27-9,CASTLE>肯定刚发生不久
<27-9,CASTLE>It must have just happened...

789
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,940
<27-9,CASTLE>因为海浪还没把血迹全冲干净
<27-9,CASTLE>'cause the tide hadn't washed away the blood.

790
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,970
<27-9,CASTLE>前一天  我们还一起玩捉迷藏
<27-9,CASTLE>We had just played hide and seek the day before.

791
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,440
<27-10,BECKETT>出什么事了
<27-10,BECKETT>What happened to him?

792
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,790
<27-11,CASTLE>一直没查出来
<27-11,CASTLE>They never found out.

793
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,020
<27-12,BECKETT>我很难过  卡塞尔
<27-12,BECKETT>I'm so sorry, Castle.

794
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,860
<27-13,BECKETT>-你杜撰的  -没错
<27-13,BECKETT>-  You made that up?  -  It's what I do!

795
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,050
<27-13,BECKETT>要知道  你演的很逼真
<27-13,BECKETT>You know what? you are so getting it for that one.

796
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,460
<27-13,BECKETT>晚会9点开始
<27-13,BECKETT>The party is at 9:00.

797
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,030
<27-13,BECKETT>我迫不及待想看看你穿什么来
<27-13,BECKETT>I cannot wait to see what you're wearing.

798
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,120
<28-1,CASTLE>你  你没装扮
<28-1,CASTLE>Hey. you're... you're not in your costume.

799
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,690
<28-2,ALEXIS>我不下去了  没心情参加派对
<28-2,ALEXIS>I'm gonna stay upstairs. Not really in a party mood.

800
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,910
<28-3,CASTLE>怎么了
<28-3,CASTLE>What's wrong?

801
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,960
<28-4,ALEXIS>佩吉很生我的气
<28-4,ALEXIS>Paige was so angry with me,

802
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,030
<28-4,ALEXIS>她弄坏了我们的科学作品
<28-4,ALEXIS>She****our science project.

803
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,310
<28-4,ALEXIS>她修不好了
<28-4,ALEXIS>She could't figure it

804
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,100
<28-4,ALEXIS>她说是失手弄坏的
<28-4,ALEXIS>She said it was an accident

805
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,500
<28-4,ALEXIS>我不知道  她是不是故意报复我
<28-4,ALEXIS>But I don't know if she did it purposly to get back at me.

806
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,980
<28-5,CASTLE>她那样做就太不对了
<28-5,CASTLE>Oh, that is so wrong on so many levels.

807
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,320
<28-6,ALEXIS>付出那么多心血后  怎么又给毁了呢
<28-6,ALEXIS>How could she take care of him the way we did and then just destroy him?

808
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,710
<28-6,ALEXIS>不知道  我觉得那是...
<28-6,ALEXIS>I don't know. I think that's...

809
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,670
<28-7,CASTLE>我写作的原因之一
<28-7,CASTLE>That's one reason why I write about it.

810
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:33,990
<28-7,CASTLE>有些人的行为让我无法理解
<28-7,CASTLE>The way some people behave just... bewilders me.

811
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,170
<28-7,CASTLE>但我要告诉你
<28-7,CASTLE>I'll tell you this, though.

812
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,080
<28-7,CASTLE>无论怎么样
<28-7,CASTLE>There is nothing you could do that would stop me

813
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,320
<28-7,CASTLE>我都会保护你或支持你
<28-7,CASTLE>From protecting you or supporting you.

814
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,320
<28-9,CASTLE>即使我的科学课得了良
<28-9,CASTLE>Even if I get a "D" in science?

815
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,780
<28-9,CASTLE>差也没关系
<28-9,CASTLE>Even if you get an "F"

816
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,670
<28-9,CASTLE>现在  赶快去换衣服
<28-9,CASTLE>Now... go get changed.

817
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,390
<28-9,CASTLE>妖魔鬼怪们马上就要来了
<28-9,CASTLE>The goblinand ghouls Shall be arriving soon.
