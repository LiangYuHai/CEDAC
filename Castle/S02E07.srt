<1-4,CASTLE>Who's dead?

28
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,800
<1-5,ALEXIS>海利·布鲁  高格网上都登了
<1-5,ALEXIS>Hayley Blue. The Gawker web site just posted it.

<1-6,CASTLE>你喜欢的乐队里的女孩
<1-6,CASTLE>Oh, the girl from the band you like.

<1-7,ALEXIS>网站上说在切尔西的小巷里发现她的尸体
<1-7,ALEXIS>They say they found her body in an alley in Chelsea.

31
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,280
<1-8,CASTLE>宝贝  那会不会是谣传
<1-8,CASTLE>Oh, angel, are you sure it's not just a rumor?

32
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,440
<1-8,CASTLE>依我看  八卦博客一般都是不实报料
<1-8,CASTLE>I mean, those gossip blogs, they don't really check facts.

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,870
<1-9,ALEXIS>上次那个消息就是真的
<1-9,ALEXIS>They were right when they said

<1-9,ALEXIS>Hayley was breaking up the band to go solo.

<2-1,PERLMUTTER>At least, that's my prelim.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,370

<2-4,BECKETT>- Are you sure it's her? - That's Hayley Blue.

43
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,600
<2-5,CASTLE>去年我带阿丽克西斯去看过她的表演  蓝色药丸
<2-5,CASTLE>I took Alexis to see her band, the blue pill, last year.

44
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,610
<2-5,CASTLE>出什么事了
<2-5,CASTLE>What happened?

45
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,280
<2-6,PERLMUTTER>看着像被人杀害后
<2-6,PERLMUTTER>Well, it looks like she was killed off-site,

46
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,610
<2-6,PERLMUTTER>弄到这里再布置好

<2-12,BECKETT>在循环播放
<2-12,BECKETT>It's on repeat.

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,960
<2-13,CASTLE>这是个线索  对吗
<2-13,CASTLE>Well, that's gotta be a message, right?

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,580
<2-14,BECKETT>好  让犯罪现场调查组来取证
<2-14,BECKETT>All right, have C.S.U. bag this,

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,480
<2-14,BECKETT>检查尸体  纤维  指纹  全部
<2-14,BECKETT>Check the body-- fibers, prints, the whole works.

56
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,370
<2-14,BECKETT>杀手完全可以把尸体丢进垃圾箱
<2-14,BECKETT>Guy could've tossed the body in a dumpster.

57
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,460
<2-14,BECKETT>而不用费劲挂在防火梯子上
<2-14,BECKETT>Instead he hangs her from a fire escape.

58
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,440
<2-14,BECKETT>应该是在传达某种信息
<2-14,BECKETT>He is sending a message.

59

<3-1,MONTGOMERY>你们回来的真是时候

<3-6,BECKETT>看起来不像  为什么
<3-6,BECKETT>Doesn't look like it. Why?

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,060
<3-6,BECKETT>她吸毒吗
<3-6,BECKETT>Did she have a drug problem?

<3-7,ALEXIS>She used to. She went to rehab a few months ago

<3-54,BECKETT>明星大腕都在这里戒毒
<3-54,BECKETT>It's where all the stars go to clean up.

132
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,840
<3-54,BECKETT>我猜  海利离开时
<3-54,BECKETT>I figured Hayley must have given them

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,500
<3-54,BECKETT>一定把自己的住址告诉他们了
<3-54,BECKETT>Her home address on her exit interview.

134
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,360
<3-54,BECKETT>海利如果要戒毒  就一定选这个中心
<3-54,BECKETT>If Hayley cleaned up. That's where she would've gone.

135
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,420
<4-1,BECKETT>布什夫人  康复中心透露
<4-1,BECKETT>Mrs. Busch, the rehab center said that

136
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,570
<4-1,BECKETT>你们夫妇支付了治疗费
<4-1,BECKETT>You and your husband payed for her treatment

137
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,500
<4-1,BECKETT>离开中心后  她搬去跟你们一起住了
<4-1,BECKETT>And that she moved in with you after she left the facility.

138
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,770
<4-2,BREE BUSCH>她和我们就像一家人
<4-2,BREE BUSCH>Yeah, she'd become like family.

139
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,330
<4-3,CASTLE>唱片制作人都出钱帮艺人戒毒吗
<4-3,CASTLE>Do all record producers pay for their artists to go to rehab?

140
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,120
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>不  多半是给他们毒品  假装没看见
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>No, most just score them drugs and then look the other way.

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,350
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>经纪人给艺人大麻  好让他们放松
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>Their manager gets 'em some pot so they can relax.

142
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,160
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>制作人给艺人毒品好让他们
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>The producer gets them some blow so they can--

143
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,060
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>继续开工
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>So they can work.

144
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,640
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>有的人给艺人海洛因
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>Then someone gets 'em heroin.

145
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,200
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>我们找到海利时  她已经上瘾了
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>By the time we got to Hayley, she was already hooked.

146
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,290
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>我们告诉她  如果能戒掉毒品
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>We told her our door was always open

147
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,470
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>会永远欢迎她
<4-4,IAN BUSCH>If she wanted to get clean.

148
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,730
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>她的水平远上乐队其他人之上
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>She was always better that band.

149
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,360
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>她是个天才
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>She was the talent.

150
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,340
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>最后当乐队解体后
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>Well, when they finally broke up,

151
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,250
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>她想戒毒  所以我们接受了她
<4-5,BREE BUSCH>She wanted off the drugs, so we took her in.

152
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,350
<4-6,IAN BUSCH>她做好了准备
<4-6,IAN BUSCH>She was ready.

153
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,030
<4-7,BREE BUSCH>她重新灌唱片  却死在歌迷手上
<4-7,BREE BUSCH>She is recording again. And to be killed by a fan.

154
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,460
<4-8,BECKETT>其实  我们尚不确定凶手就是弗兰克
<4-8,BECKETT>Actually, we don't know for sure that it was Franco.

155
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,460
<4-9,IAN BUSCH>-不确定  -不
<4-9,IAN BUSCH>- You don't? - No

156
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,470
<4-10,BECKETT>那是因为你没听到她在半夜三更
<4-10,BECKETT>You weren't there in the middle of the night

157
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,310
<4-11,IAN BUSCH>尖叫着惊醒过来
<4-11,IAN BUSCH>When she was waking up screaming,

158
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,820
<4-11,IAN BUSCH>害怕同样的事再发生
<4-11,IAN BUSCH>Terrified that something like this was gonna happen.

159
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,310
<4-12,BREE BUSCH>我们本想保护她
<4-12,BREE BUSCH>We were supposed to protect her.

160
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,300
<4-12,BREE BUSCH>本应该再加把劲把她找回来
<4-12,BREE BUSCH>We should've tried harder to find her.

161
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,370
<4-13,BECKETT>找回来
<4-13,BECKETT>To find her?

162
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,450
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>上周一  工作室有个研讨会  她没来
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>Last Monday, she didn't show up at the studio for a session.

163
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,200
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>我们回家时  她已经走了
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>When we got home, she was gone,

164
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>还带走了衣服  手表和珠宝
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>So were her clothes, her watch, her jewelry--

165
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,490
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>值钱的都拿走了  我们猜想
<4-14,IAN BUSCH>Anything she could sell. We figured--

166
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,700
<4-15,CASTLE>她的毒瘾又犯了
<4-15,CASTLE>She had relapsed.

167
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,670
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>我们给她打电话  但不在服务区
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>We tried calling her, but her cell phone was disconnected.

168
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,560
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>你知道  不说一声就走不像她的作风
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>It, you know, it wasn't like her to just disappear.

169
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,380
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>她肯定受到什么惊吓
<4-16,BREE BUSCH>Something spooked her.

170
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,400
<4-17,CASTLE>海利有亲人吗
<4-17,CASTLE>Did Hayley have any family?

171
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,200
<4-18,BREE BUSCH>有一个姐姐叫斯凯
<4-18,BREE BUSCH>Yeah. A sister. Sky.

172
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,880
<4-19,BECKETT>你们知道哪里能找到她吗
<4-19,BECKETT>Do you know where we could find her?

173
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,280
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>无论在哪里  总是离不开毒品
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>Wherever she is, she probably has a needle in her arm.

174
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,840
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>海利从康复中心回来
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>When Hayley got out of rehab,

175
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,870
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>总在说要去救斯凯
<4-20,IAN BUSCH>All she could talk about was saving Sky.

176
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,620
<4-21,BREE BUSCH>海利的行为  让斯凯不想被救
<4-21,BREE BUSCH>Not that Sky wanted saving after what Hayley did to her.

177
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,900
<4-22,BECKETT>海利做什么了
<4-22,BECKETT>What did Hayley do to her?

178
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,030
<4-23,BREE BUSCH>她成名了
<4-23,BREE BUSCH>She got famous.

179
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,650
<4-24,BECKETT>失陪

<5-1,ESPOSITO>从住处匆匆离开
<5-1,ESPOSITO>From the looks of his place, he left in a hurry.

<5-2,BECKETT>-知道他要去哪里吗  -他要离开此地
<5-2,BECKETT>- Any idea where he was going? - Yeah. Away.

<8-1,ESPOSITO>Apparently, he likes to hit women.

235
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,140
<8-1,ESPOSITO>瞧这家伙
<8-1,ESPOSITO>Look at this guy.

236
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,680
<8-2,CASTLE>如果我是个女人  我会反击
<8-2,CASTLE>If I was a woman, I'd just hit him back.

237
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,230
<8-2,CASTLE>你觉得他像凶手吗
<8-2,CASTLE>Does he look like a killer to you?

238
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,940
<8-3,BECKETT>对我来说所有人都像凶手  卡塞尔
<8-3,BECKETT>Everybody looks like a killer to me, Castle.

239
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,450
<8-3,BECKETT>工作需要
<8-3,BECKETT>Job requirement.

242
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,880
<8-5,BECKETT>刚刚收到第20分局
<8-5,BECKETT>Hey. so... I just took a report

243
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,050
<8-6,RYAN>接待人员发来的消息
<8-6,RYAN>From the receiving officer at the 20th precinct.

244
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,680
<8-6,RYAN>他在新闻里认出了海利
<8-6,RYAN>He recognized Hayley from the news.

245
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,970
<8-8,RYAN>-说什么了  -他说在警局见过海利
<8-8,RYAN>- And? - He says Hayley showed up at their door

246
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,610
<8-8,RYAN>就在失踪当天  她有份报告要交警局
<8-8,RYAN>To file a report the day she went missing.

247
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,730
<8-10,RYAN>-什么内容  -他不清楚
<8-10,RYAN>- About what?  - He doesn't know.

<8-10,RYAN>她要求跟警探说话
<8-10,RYAN>She asked to speak with a detective.

249
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,100
<8-10,RYAN>等接待人员找到警探的时候
<8-10,RYAN>By the time the receiving officer found one,

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,450
<8-10,RYAN>她却溜走了
<8-10,RYAN>She'd skipped out.

251
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,600
<8-11,ESPOSITO>主动找警察的唯一理由就是来报案
<8-11,ESPOSITO>There's only one reason you go to the cops--to report a crime.

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,340
<8-12,BECKETT>也可能是找警察帮忙  感到自己有危险
<8-12,BECKETT>Or to get help because you think you're in danger.

253
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,210
<9-1,ZACK>海利的事我们都听说了
<9-1,ZACK>We heard about what happened to Hayley.

<9-2,CASTLE>- Sucks, right?  - Can I get you a tissue?

<9-6,ZACK>-不是我杀的  -能肯定吗
<9-6,ZACK>- Well, I didn't kill her. - Are you sure about that?

258
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,300
<9-7,CASTLE>就没有情绪过激
<9-7,CASTLE>You sure you didn't get a little high,

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,660
<9-7,CASTLE>可能跟你的队友发生了点小摩擦
<9-7,CASTLE>Maybe pull a "hulk smash" on your band mate?

<9-10,ZACK>I paid with a credit card. Are we done?

268
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,350
<9-11,CASTLE>给花季少女们办派对
<9-11,CASTLE>Wow. Sweet 16 parties.

269
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,150
<9-11,CASTLE>海利在乐队时  你们不是为名流演出吗
<9-11,CASTLE>When Hayley was with the band, weren't you opening for pink?

270
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,590
<9-12,ZACK>你们到底想听什么
<9-12,ZACK>What do you guys want me to say?

271
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,990
<9-12,ZACK>她玩消失  还要单飞
<9-12,ZACK>Okay, she screwed all of us when she had her little meltdown

272
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,730
<9-12,ZACK>把我们整个乐队都毁了
<9-12,ZACK>And decided to go solo.

273
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,720
<9-12,ZACK>恨她吗  恨  宰了她吗  没有
<9-12,ZACK>Do I hate her? Des. Did I kill her? No.

274
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,140
<9-13,BECKETT>为什么起内讧
<9-13,BECKETT>What'd you guys fight about?

275
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,470
<9-14,ZACK>这个自私的婊子
<9-14,ZACK>Her being a selfish bitch.

276
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,220
<9-14,ZACK>自从她发觉
<9-14,ZACK>She found out

277
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,780
<9-14,ZACK>她是吸引观众的不可或缺的法宝
<9-14,ZACK>That we were holding auditions for her replacement.

278
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,420
<9-14,ZACK>就给我们下了最后通牒
<9-14,ZACK>And she had those d-bag producers send us

279
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,740
<9-15,CASTLE>-一封警"号"信  -或者说"警告信"
<9-15,CASTLE>- A cease and resist letter. - Or a cease and desist letter.

280
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,930
<9-16,ZACK>我们乐队以"蓝色药丸"而扬名
<9-16,ZACK>We made the reputation for the name "Blue Pill,"

281
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,380
<9-16,ZACK>不过所有权在她手上
<9-16,ZACK>But she owned it.

282
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,480
<9-16,ZACK>所以呢  她就玩消失  跑得无影无踪
<9-16,ZACK>So what? She has a meltdown and disappears off the map,

283
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,140
<9-16,ZACK>我们连自己乐队的名字都用不了
<9-16,ZACK>A-a-and we can't use our own damn name?

284
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,980
<9-17,CASTLE>-见鬼  现在连被捕都泡汤了  -瞧你这词儿选的
<9-17,CASTLE>- Hell, we can't even get arrested now. - Poor choice of words.

286
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,290
<9-17,CASTLE>好
<9-17,CASTLE>Okay.

287
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,290
<9-18,BECKETT>海利的姐姐马上到停尸房去认尸
<9-18,BECKETT>Hayley's sister is on her way to the morgue to identify the body.

288
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,480
<9-18,BECKETT>别出城
<9-18,BECKETT>Don't leave town.

289
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,130
<9-19,CASTLE>但洗澡请随意
<9-19,CASTLE>But feel free to bathe.

290
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,340
<10-2,PERLMUTTER>对  请现在就派保安来
<10-2,PERLMUTTER>Yeah, we need security down here right away.

<10-4,BECKETT>出什么事了
<10-4,BECKETT>What's going on in there?

<10-5,PERLMUTTER>对妹妹的死反应过激
<10-5,PERLMUTTER>Is having a very emotional reaction to her sister's death.

294
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,540
<10-6,SKY>你这个伪君子  看看谁先挂了

<11-19,BECKETT>等等  她又开始复吸了
<11-19,BECKETT>Wait a minute. she was using again?

341
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,130
<11-20,SKY>那天我见她之后  她跟托尼在一起
<11-20,SKY>Yeah, she was with Tony the day after I saw her.

342
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,880
<11-21,BECKETT>托尼是谁
<11-21,BECKETT>Who's Tony?

343
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,630
<11-22,SKY>我的毒品贩子
<11-22,SKY>My dealer.

344
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,530
<11-22,SKY>她正递给他一叠钱
<11-22,SKY>She was handing him a wad of cash.

345
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,000
<12-1,CASTLE>我在想  要是她又开始复吸了
<12-1,CASTLE>I was just thinking, if she was using again,

346
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,900
<12-1,CASTLE>就能解释  她为何要离开她的经纪人
<12-1,CASTLE>That would explain why she left her producers,

347
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,500
<12-1,CASTLE>但不能解释她为何被杀
<12-1,CASTLE>But not why she was killed,

348
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,140
<12-1,CASTLE>谁杀了她或为何去报警
<12-1,CASTLE>Who killed her or why she went to the police.

349
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,750
<12-2,CASTLE>我刚说的话没这么难懂吧
<12-2,CASTLE>What I just said was not confusing enough

350
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,370
<12-2,CASTLE>-看你像听懵了  -帕尔马特刚来电话
<12-2,CASTLE>- For your face to do what it's doing. - That was Perlmutter.

351
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,370
<12-3,BECKETT>刚从实验室拿到毒性检测报告
<12-3,BECKETT>The tox results just got back from the lab.

352
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,830
<12-3,BECKETT>海利体内未发现毒品痕迹
<12-3,BECKETT>There were no drugs in Hayley's System.

353
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,790
<12-3,BECKETT>她一点毒品没沾  神志完全清醒
<12-3,BECKETT>She was 100% clean and sober.

354
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,670
<12-4,CASTLE>那他为何会给那个毒品贩子托尼
<12-4,CASTLE>Then why was she giving a wad of cash

355
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,920
<12-4,CASTLE>那么一大叠钱
<12-4,CASTLE>To Tony the drug dealer?

356
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,110
<13-1,TONY>-她不是想买毒品  是想买枪  -买枪
<13-1,TONY>- She didn't want drugs. She wanted a gun. - A gun?

357
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,840
<13-2,CASTLE>还不要点22口径的枪
<13-2,CASTLE>Not a punk-ass .22 either.

358
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,080
<13-3,TONY>要点38口径的  她想找人拼命呢
<13-3,TONY>A .38. She wanted to put a hole in a brother.

359
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,740
<13-3,TONY>既然她都死了  我想我那会真做对了
<13-3,TONY>Seeing as she's dead, I say I did the right thing at the time.

360
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,290
<13-3,TONY>-那女的吓坏了  -怕什么
<13-3,TONY>- The girl was scared. - Of what?

361
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,720
<13-5,TONY>她没说  我也没问
<13-5,TONY>Didn't say, and I didn't ask.

362
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,020
<13-5,TONY>她就只想买枪
<13-5,TONY>She just wanted the gun.

363
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,670
<14-2,PERLMUTTER>-你确定吗  -打算教我怎么当法医
<14-2,PERLMUTTER>- Are you sure?  - You telling me how to do my job?

364
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,580
<14-3,BECKETT>不  帕尔马特  我可没这么想
<14-3,BECKETT>No, Perlmutter. I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job.

365
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,650
<14-4,PERLMUTTER>很好  该交待的都告诉你
<14-4,PERLMUTTER>Good, 'cause that's all you get.

366
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,400
<14-5,BECKETT>我只是...  喂  他甩我电话
<14-5,BECKETT>I just... hello? He just hung up on me.

367
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,180
<14-6,CASTLE>他只能跟死人打交道  总归是有原因的嘛
<14-6,CASTLE>There's a reason he hangs out with dead people.

368
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,810
<14-6,CASTLE>他说什么了
<14-6,CASTLE>So what did he say?

369
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,380
<14-7,BECKETT>他鉴定出  在海利脸上画出笑脸
<14-7,BECKETT>He identified the lipstick that was used

370
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,090
<14-7,BECKETT>所用的那支唇膏
<14-7,BECKETT>To paint a smile on Hayley's face

371
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,540
<14-7,BECKETT>是丹妮娜·博伦的天鹅绒触感系列唇膏  岩浆红色
<14-7,BECKETT>As Daniella Bolan's Velvet Kiss Lipstick--Lava red.

372
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,400
<14-8,CASTLE>那枪呢  他说那枪什么了吗
<14-8,CASTLE>Yes, but what about the gun? What'd he say about the gun?

373
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,180
<14-9,BECKETT>还以为你不会问呢
<14-9,BECKETT>Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

374
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,440
<14-9,BECKETT>他们在海利手上发现弹药残留
<14-9,BECKETT>They found gunpowder residue on Hayley's hands.

375
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,590
<14-10,CASTLE>就是说她不但买了枪  还用了
<14-10,CASTLE>So not only did she buy a gun, but she used it.

376
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,950
<14-10,CASTLE>那为什么我们没找到
<14-10,CASTLE>But why didn't we find it?

377
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,790
<14-11,BECKETT>因为我们发现的  不是她被害的现场
<14-11,BECKETT>That's because we didn't find her where she was killed.

378
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,050
<14-11,BECKETT>有人袭击了她  是她所害怕的那个人
<14-11,BECKETT>So someone attacked her, someone that she was afraid of.

379
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,130
<14-11,BECKETT>她想朝他开枪  然后争斗中
<14-11,BECKETT>She tries to shoot them, and in the struggle,

380
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,250
<14-11,BECKETT>袭击者扭断了她的脖子  把她拖到小巷里
<14-11,BECKETT>The assailant breaks her neck, drags her down an alleyway,

381
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,540
<14-11,BECKETT>倒吊起来  在她脸上画了个笑脸
<14-11,BECKETT>Hangs her upside down, paints a smile on her face,

382
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,240
<14-11,BECKETT>摆弄得就像她的音乐录影带里一样
<14-11,BECKETT>Which apparently was a lot like a music video

383
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,790
<14-11,BECKETT>这跟我们的凶手没有任何关系
<14-11,BECKETT>That has nothing to do with our murder.

384
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,470
<14-12,CASTLE>你这么说的时候
<14-12,CASTLE>You thought you sounded so smart

385
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,130
<14-12,CASTLE>-自我感觉非常良好  是吗  -好吧  神秘作家先生
<14-12,CASTLE>- When you started that sentence,didn't you? - Mr.Mystery Writer Man,

386
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,260
<14-14,CASTLE>-你的畅销秘诀又是什么  -我会让管家来想
<14-14,CASTLE>- What's your best-selling theory? - I'm gonna go with the butler.

387
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,770
<14-16,CASTLE>-管家  -没有灵感的时候  我们都这么干
<14-16,CASTLE>- The butler?  - That's who we always go with when we run out of ideas.

388
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,380
<14-17,BECKETT>-阿丽克西斯怎么样  -阿丽克西斯
<14-17,BECKETT>- How about Alexis? - Oh, Alexis.

389
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,350
<14-18,CASTLE>她很合适啊  跟这案子没有关系
<14-18,CASTLE>She's perfect-- she's peripheral to the case,

390
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,370
<14-18,CASTLE>我们不会怀疑她  她也没有犯罪动机
<14-18,CASTLE>We don't suspect her, she has no alibi.

391
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,490
<14-19,BECKETT>好吧  不如这样  你先回家
<14-19,BECKETT>Okay, I'll tell you what, why don't you go home

392
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,340
<14-19,BECKETT>盘问一下  等她交待后就打我电话
<14-19,BECKETT>Question her and if she breaks, call me.

393
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,880
<15-1,CASTLE>如果你杀了人  你会告诉我的  对吗
<15-1,CASTLE>If you killed someone, you would tell me, right?

394
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,790
<15-1,CASTLE>当然
<15-1,CASTLE>Of course.

395
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
<15-2,ALEXIS>得让你帮忙毁尸灭迹的啊
<15-2,ALEXIS>I'd need help hiding the body.

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,190
<15-3,CASTLE>不愧是我女儿
<15-3,CASTLE>Ah ha ha. That's my girl.

397
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,090
<15-5,CASTLE>-亲爱的  -收到我发的消息了吗
<15-5,CASTLE>- Hi, darling. - Did you get my texts?

398
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,010
<15-6,ALEXIS>对  你真的见到了"蓝色药丸"的其他成员
<15-6,ALEXIS>Yeah. Did you really meet the rest of the blue pill?

399
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,060
<15-7,CASTLE>是的  我只能说  距离产生美
<15-7,CASTLE>Yes, I did, and all I can say is, admire them from afar.

400
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,700
<15-8,MARTHA>-你在听什么  -海利最后一场演出
<15-8,MARTHA>- What are you listening to? - It's Hayley's last performance.

401
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,450
<15-8,MARTHA>她听了一晚上  没完没了
<15-8,MARTHA>Oy! She hasn't stopped listening to it all night.

402
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,880
<15-8,MARTHA>这场演出叫"门槛"
<15-8,MARTHA>It's called "Threshold."

403
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,700
<15-9,CASTLE>是吗  听起来不错
<15-9,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. It's, uh, it's pretty.

404
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
<15-9,CASTLE>虽然有点怪
<15-9,CASTLE>A little creepy, though.

405
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,260
<15-11,ALEXIS>-非常怪  -怎么会怪呢
<15-11,ALEXIS>- Very creepy. - How's it creepy?

406
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,060
<15-12,CASTLE>"死神越走越近"  简直就像《死神来了》
<15-12,CASTLE>"Death, she grows near"? It's kinda like "Final Destination,"

407
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,870
<15-13,ALEXIS>但在歌里  她说的死亡  并不真是死亡
<15-13,ALEXIS>But in song form. she doesn't mean "death" death.

408
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,840
<15-14,CASTLE>那还能是哪种死亡
<15-14,CASTLE>Well, what other kinds of death are there?

409
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,120
<15-15,ALEXIS>寓意的  隐喻的  象征意义的  精神上的
<15-15,ALEXIS>Allegorical, metaphoric, symbolic, spiritual,

410
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,670
<15-16,CASTLE>-感情上的  两性间的  -好了好了  够了
<15-16,CASTLE>- Emotional, sexual-- - Ah, o-okay, okay. That's quite enough.

411
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,300
<15-16,CASTLE>看来她学的知识过多了
<15-16,CASTLE>I think I'm paying far too much for her education.

412
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,030
<15-17,ALEXIS>我觉得这是有象征意义的  海利运用了各种
<15-17,ALEXIS>I think this one's symbolic. Hayley was into all sorts

413
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,840
<15-17,ALEXIS>新新人类的意象  命理学  占星术  塔罗牌
<15-17,ALEXIS>Of new age-y imagery--uh, numerology, astrology, tarot.

414
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,390
<15-17,ALEXIS>在塔罗牌里  死神卡并不象征着死亡
<15-17,ALEXIS>And in tarot, the death card doesn't symbolize dying.

415
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,550
<15-17,ALEXIS>而是象征着转变  变化
<15-17,ALEXIS>It symbolizes transformation, change.

416
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,890
<15-18,HAYLEY BLUE>听这个
<15-18,HAYLEY BLUE>Listen.

417
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,790
<15-19,ALEXIS>我们手中的牌  就好像她正在看牌
<15-19,ALEXIS>"The hands we're dealt," like she's having her cards read.

418
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,500
<15-19,ALEXIS>死神越走越近  意味着变化就要来临
<15-19,ALEXIS>"Death grows near" means change is coming.

419
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,660
<15-20,MARTHA>这让我想起跟莉莎·奥森在一起
<15-20,MARTHA>Oh, oh, that reminds me of sitting around with Lisa Olsen

420
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,220
<15-20,MARTHA>想要解读甲壳虫的歌词
<15-20,MARTHA>Trying to decode the Beatles' lyrics--

421
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,390
<15-20,MARTHA>还倒带回去  去确认
<15-20,MARTHA>Spinning the record backwards and to see if, uh,

422
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,970
<15-20,MARTHA>保罗是不是死了
<15-20,MARTHA>Paul was dead.

423
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,360
<15-21,CASTLE>简直就能忘了时间飞逝
<15-21,CASTLE>And who could forget the countless hours

424
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,210
<15-21,CASTLE>我研究过范·海伦乐队《谁上我的床》的歌词
<15-21,CASTLE>I spent pondering the lyrics to Van Halen's "Hot For Teacher"?

425
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,110
<15-22,CASTLE>就像在演一出戏
<15-22,CASTLE>Sounds like a drama is afoot.

426
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,830
<15-22,CASTLE>谁亲了谁  又是在哪个露天看台
<15-22,CASTLE>Who kissed whom at which bleachers?

427
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,120
<15-23,ALEXIS>这是"蓝色药丸"的官方网站
<15-23,ALEXIS>No, it's the official Blue Pill web site.

428
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,600
<15-23,ALEXIS>有一个新帖
<15-23,ALEXIS>There's a new thread

429
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,710

<15-23,ALEXIS>- Talking about the band getting back together. - What?

<15-25,ALEXIS>看这个
<15-25,ALEXIS>Look at this.

431
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,750
<15-26,CASTLE>斯凯·布鲁将取代海利  成为乐队主唱
<15-26,CASTLE>"Sky Blue is supposed to take Hayley's place as lead singer.

432
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,600
<15-26,CASTLE>这事已经谈成了
<15-26,CASTLE>"This is all but a done deal.

433
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,100
<15-26,CASTLE>听说他们马上开始彩排了
<15-26,CASTLE>"I heard they're starting rehearsals right away.

434

<15-26,CASTLE>-我的天  我的天  我的天  -看这个
<15-26,CASTLE>- O.M.G.! O.M.G.! O.M.G.! " - And look at this one.

435
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,610
<15-27,ALEXIS>来自约翰·麦克尼金斯经纪公司的消息称
<15-27,ALEXIS>"A source at John Mcginnis Management

436
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,240
<15-27,ALEXIS>此事已经得到证实
<15-27,ALEXIS>"Confirmed it when I called--

437

<15-27,ALEXIS>The Blue Pill is definitely getting back together."

438
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,320
<15-28,CASTLE>纪念海利·布鲁巡回演出
<15-28,CASTLE>"The Hayley Blue tribute tour.

439
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,920
<15-29,ALEXIS>我以为你说过海利不会让乐队
<15-29,ALEXIS>" I thought you said Hayley wouldn't let the band

440
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,130
<15-29,ALEXIS>-要回这个名字  -她是不会
<15-29,ALEXIS>- Have the name back. - She wouldn't.

441
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,050
<15-31,ALEXIS>-那这怎么说  -海利死了  斯凯是她唯一的亲人
<15-31,ALEXIS>- Then how can they use it? - Hayley is dead and Sky's her only family.

442
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,140
<15-32,CASTLE>如果这名字原本归海利  那么现在归斯凯了
<15-32,CASTLE>If Hayley owned the name, then it would go to Sky.

443
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,000
<15-33,ALEXIS>你不会认为斯凯杀了自己妹妹吧
<15-33,ALEXIS>You don't think Sky killed her own sister?

444
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,300
<15-34,CASTLE>斯凯只有100磅  还是瘾君子
<15-34,CASTLE>Sky is 100 pounds dripping wet.

445
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
<15-34,CASTLE>她唯一能折断的  是她自己的脖子
<15-34,CASTLE>The only neck she could break is her own.

<15-35,CASTLE>约翰·麦克尼金斯经纪公司经济公司  谁是约翰·麦克尼金斯
<15-35,CASTLE>"John Mcginnis Management." Who's John Mcginnis?

447
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,870
<15-36,ALEXIS>海利原来的经纪人  她戒毒之后就炒了他
<15-36,ALEXIS>Hayley's old manager. She fired him when she got clean.

448
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,260
<15-36,ALEXIS>她没直说他的名字
<15-36,ALEXIS>She didn't say his name,

449
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,930
<15-36,ALEXIS>在她上个月的唱片采访中
<15-36,ALEXIS>But in her interview in "Spin" last month,

450
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,080
<15-36,ALEXIS>她差不多暗指了  他就是那个
<15-36,ALEXIS>She pretty much implied that he's the one

451
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,940
<15-36,ALEXIS>引她吸毒成瘾的那人
<15-36,ALEXIS>That got her hooked to begin with.

452
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,350
<15-37,CASTLE>如果乐队真的再聚首  他获利最丰
<15-37,CASTLE>If the band got back together, he'd have the most to gain.

453
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,650
<15-38,MARTHA>在你看来  这人像凶手吗
<15-38,MARTHA>Now does that man look like a killer to you?

454
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,350
<15-38,MARTHA>在我眼里每个人都像凶手
<15-38,MARTHA>Everybody looks like a killer to me.

455
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,400
<15-39,CASTLE>工作需要
<15-39,CASTLE>It's a job requirement.

456
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,470
<15-40,ALEXIS>你就没这么说过斯凯
<15-40,ALEXIS>You didn't say that about Sky.

457
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,990
<15-41,CASTLE>让我先陶醉一会
<15-41,CASTLE>Just... let me have this moment.

458
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,870
<15-41,CASTLE>我跟你们说过了
<15-41,CASTLE>I told you--

459
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,060
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>周六晚上  我正在费城观察一支乐队
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>Sunday night, I was in Philly scouting a band.

460
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,920
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>投宿在汽车旅馆  看了付费节目
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>I hit a motel, I watched a little pay-per-view,

461
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,120
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>然后就睡了
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>And I went to bed,

462
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,200
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>这可能说明我的生活品味不高
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>Which may say something about my taste,

463
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,520
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>但不能证明我就是个罪犯
<16-1,JOHN MCGINNIS>But it does not make me a criminal.

464
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,550
<16-2,BECKETT>但你的犯罪记录可以
<16-2,BECKETT>But your rap sheet does.

465
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,130
<16-3,BECKETT>六项轻罪
<16-3,BECKETT>Six counts of misdemeanor possession,

466
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,180
<16-3,BECKETT>两项重罪  可能还会增加
<16-3,BECKETT>Two counts of felony possession with the intent to distribute.

467
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,300
<16-4,CASTLE>你干了些什么  麦克尼金斯
<16-4,CASTLE>What'd you do, Mcginnis,

468
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,540
<16-4,CASTLE>给他们些甜头
<16-4,CASTLE>Give 'em a little taste,

469
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,080
<16-4,CASTLE>让他们需要你  依靠你
<16-4,CASTLE>Make 'em need you, make 'em depend on you?

470
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,320
<16-4,CASTLE>想知道我做了什么
<16-4,CASTLE>You want to know what I do?

471
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,590
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>是我成就了她
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>I make things happen

472
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,630
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>当我遇到海利和她姐姐的时候
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>When I met Hayley and her sister,

473
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,670
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>她们还在东村的露天咖啡屋驻唱
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>They were playing open mikes at coffeehouses in the east village.

474
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,290
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>谁给她找的声乐教练
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>Who do you think got her a vocal coach?

475
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>谁给她请造型师
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>Who paid for her stylist?

476
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,360
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>我把一个三流  三流的麦莉·塞勒斯
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>I took a third-rate-- a third-rate--Miley Cyrus

477
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,560
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>变成了下一个格温·史蒂芬妮
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>And turned her into the next Gwen Stefani,

478
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,370
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>而当我要大赚一票的时候  她却离开了
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>And right before my payoff, she walks away.

479
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,970
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>我...
<16-5,JOHN MCGINNIS>I... I...

480
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,080
<16-6,CASTLE>但乐队仍旧属于她
<16-6,CASTLE>And since she owned the band name,

481
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,510
<16-6,CASTLE>你束手无策
<16-6,CASTLE>Your hands were tied.

482
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,740
<16-6,CASTLE>现在她死了
<16-6,CASTLE>But now that she's dead,

483
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,400
<16-6,CASTLE>现在你只需要找到斯凯来代替她
<16-6,CASTLE>All you needed to do was rope in Sky.

484
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,670
<16-6,CASTLE>听着
<16-6,CASTLE>Look...

485
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,660
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>我的看法是
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>The way I see it,

486
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,610
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>乐队重组的话  每个人都能赚一大笔
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>The band gets back together, everybody makes a lot of money,

487
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,220
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>大家都高兴
<16-7,JOHN MCGINNIS>Everybody's happy.

488
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,780
<16-8,BECKETT>除了海利  因为她已经死了
<16-8,BECKETT>Except for Hayley, because she's dead.

489
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,990
<16-9,JOHN MCGINNIS>当乐队重新进行巡演的时候
<16-9,JOHN MCGINNIS>Which will no doubt help us sell lots of tickets

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,150
<16-9,JOHN MCGINNIS>这也能帮我们卖很多票
<16-9,JOHN MCGINNIS>When the band goes back on tour.

491
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,710
<16-10,BECKETT>这就是你杀她的原因吗
<16-10,BECKETT>Is that why you killed her?

492
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,190
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>我知道自己的权利  我不想再说了
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>Now I know my rights here, and I'm done talking.

493
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,940
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>你认为自己有证据  那就逮捕我啊
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>You think you got a case? Arrest me.

494
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,930
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>我巴不得能提高点曝光率
<16-11,JOHN MCGINNIS>I would love to have that kind of publicity.

495
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,190
<17-1,CASTLE>我从来没像刚才那样深刻体会到
<17-1,CASTLE>I never fully appreciated the nuances of the word "skeevy"

496
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,260
<17-1,CASTLE>"Skeevy"的含义
<17-1,CASTLE>Until just now.

497
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,520
<17-2,BECKETT>嘿  莱恩  你找到麦克尼金斯
<17-2,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, did you get the phone records

498
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,290
<17-2,BECKETT>以及他经济公司的电话记录了吗
<17-2,BECKETT>For John Mcginnis and Mcginnis Management?

499
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,140
<17-3,RYAN>嗯  弄到了
<17-3,RYAN>Yeah, just got 'em.

500
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,590
<17-4,CASTLE>难道你真认为是他干的
<17-4,CASTLE>You don't think he did it?

501
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,610
<17-5,BECKETT>他向我挑衅  以为我不敢抓他
<17-5,BECKETT>He challenged me to arrest him.

502
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,930
<17-5,BECKETT>也许他很顽固
<17-5,BECKETT>He's probably screwed

503
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,350
<17-5,BECKETT>其实就会唬人而已
<17-5,BECKETT>And figures bluffing is his best bet.

504
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,540
<17-5,BECKETT>莱恩  比照一下通话记录和疑犯名单
<17-5,BECKETT>Ryan, let's cross-reference his calls with our hit list,

505
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,550
<17-5,BECKETT>看看他是否有和
<17-5,BECKETT>Find out if he was in contact with anyone

506
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,220
<17-5,BECKETT>海利比较亲近的人联系
<17-5,BECKETT>From Hayley's inner circle.

507
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,710
<17-6,CASTLE>可他当时在费城
<17-6,CASTLE>What about him being in Philadelphia?

508
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,110
<17-7,BECKETT>只要找到方法  你甚至能用电话杀人
<17-7,BECKETT>With the right connections, you can kill with a phone call.

509
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,730
<17-8,RYAN>有  这里
<17-8,RYAN>Yeah, right here.

510
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,080
<17-8,RYAN>在海利死前一天  麦克尼金斯给
<17-8,RYAN>Looks like the day before Hayley died, Mcginnis put in

511
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,150
<17-8,RYAN>吉他手扎克打了长达十分钟的电话
<17-8,RYAN>A 10-minute phone call to Zack, the guitarist.

512
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,940
<17-9,BECKETT>他有好几个月不参与乐队演出了
<17-9,BECKETT>He hasn't represented the band in months.

513
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,430
<17-10,CASTLE>他为什么要在海利死之前给扎克打电话呢
<17-10,CASTLE>Why would he call Zack the day before Hayley died?

514
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,100
<17-11,BECKETT>去查查就知道了
<17-11,BECKETT>Let's go find out.

515
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,490
<18-1,ZACK>怎么回事儿啊  你这神经病
<18-1,ZACK>What is your problem, you freak?!

516
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,030
<18-1,ZACK>你真是疯了
<18-1,ZACK>You are completely mental!

517
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,860
<18-2,SKY>你以为你是谁啊  你这个窝囊废
<18-2,SKY>Who the hell do you think you are, loser?!

518
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,700
<18-3,ZACK>你给我站住  我在和你说话呢
<18-3,ZACK>Don't you walk away from me. I'm talking to you!

519
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,110
<18-4,SKY>你给我走开  再碰我试试
<18-4,SKY>Get the hell away from me! You touch me again,

520
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,220
<18-4,SKY>我发誓  我要杀了你
<18-4,SKY>And I swear to god, I will kill you!

521
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,880
<18-5,BECKETT>嘿  嘿
<18-5,BECKETT>Hey! Hey!

522
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,650

<18-6,ZACK>Screw you, you stupid whore!

00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,150
<18-7,CASTLE>坐下  扎克
<18-7,CASTLE>Sit down, zack!

524
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,630
<18-8,SKY>哦  闭嘴
<18-8,SKY>Oh, stop!

525
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,140
<18-9,BECKETT>嘿  斯凯  好了没事儿了
<18-9,BECKETT>Hey, Sky. it's okay. Sky.

526
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,690
<18-10,SKY>放开我  不要管我
<18-10,SKY>No, don't! leave me alone.

527
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,410
<18-11,CASTLE>你对她做了些什么
<18-11,CASTLE>What did you do to her?

528
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,650
<18-12,ZACK>我什么都没做  是她攻击我
<18-12,ZACK>Nothing, man! She attacked me.

529
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,920
<18-12,ZACK>我们在排海利的一首歌
<18-12,ZACK>We were riffing on one of Hayley's songs.

530
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,950
<18-12,ZACK>前一秒她还在唱歌  下一秒
<18-12,ZACK>One minute she's singing along, the next minute,

531
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,920
<18-12,ZACK>就开始发疯了  说我是在抄袭海利
<18-12,ZACK>She goes postal, starts telling me I'm stealing from Hayley.

532
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,330
<18-12,ZACK>她疯了
<18-12,ZACK>She's crazy.

533
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,330
<18-13,CASTLE>现在情况对你很不利  扎克
<18-13,CASTLE>It doesn't look good, Zack.

534
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,910
<18-13,CASTLE>把一个打的鼻青脸肿  又杀了另一个
<18-13,CASTLE>Beating up one blue, killing another?

535
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,020
<18-14,ZACK>听着  我已经说过了
<18-14,ZACK>Look, I already told you gu--

536
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,400
<18-15,BECKETT>给我坐下  坐下
<18-15,BECKETT>Sit down! sit!

537
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,470
<18-15,BECKETT>现在解释
<18-15,BECKETT>Now talk.

538
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,670
<18-16,ZACK>我已经告诉你们了  我没有杀海利
<18-16,ZACK>I already told you guys, I didn't kill Hayley. okay?

539
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,180
<18-16,ZACK>我在生日演唱会上  忘了吗
<18-16,ZACK>I was at the birthday gig, remember?

540
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,180
<18-17,BECKETT>是的  在Gillespies' Sweet16号
<18-17,BECKETT>Right. The Gillespies' Sweet 16?

541
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,490
<18-17,BECKETT>你中间离开了一个半小时
<18-17,BECKETT>You took three half-hour breaks in between sets,

542
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
<18-17,BECKETT>在这期间没人看到过你
<18-17,BECKETT>During which no one remembers seeing you.

543
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,870
<18-17,BECKETT>你可以轻松溜走然后杀了海利
<18-17,BECKETT>You could've easily slipped away and killed Hayley.

544
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,350
<18-18,ZACK>没人看到我  因为我不想
<18-18,ZACK>Nobody saw me because I didn't want to spark up a pipe

545
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,780
<18-18,ZACK>在一群青少年中引起混乱
<18-18,ZACK>In front of a bunch of teenagers.

546
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,980
<18-19,CASTLE>你的细心周到还真是令人敬佩
<18-19,CASTLE>Well, your innate sense of decency is inspiring.

547
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,430
<18-20,BECKETT>你为什么在海利死的前一天
<18-20,BECKETT>Why did you talk to John Mcginnis

548
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,450
<18-20,BECKETT>和约翰·麦金尼斯通话
<18-20,BECKETT>The day before Hayley was killed?

549
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,880
<18-21,ZACK>他是我的经纪人  那也算犯罪吗
<18-21,ZACK>He's my manager. Is that a crime?

550
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,810
<18-22,BECKETT>是前经纪人  在海利解散了乐队之后
<18-22,BECKETT>Ex-manager. He let all of you guys go

551
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,220
<18-22,BECKETT>他也让你们都离开了
<18-22,BECKETT>After Hayley disbanded the group.

552
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:57,060
<18-22,BECKETT>他为什么还给你打电话  扎克
<18-22,BECKETT>So why did he call you, Zack?

553
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,030
<18-22,BECKETT>我来告诉你  你们都想摆脱海利
<18-22,BECKETT>I'll tell you why. You both needed to get rid of Hayley

554
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,770
<18-22,BECKETT>从而夺回乐队
<18-22,BECKETT>To get the band name back,

555
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,990
<18-22,BECKETT>他给你打电话  告诉你计划
<18-22,BECKETT>And he called with a plan.

556
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,400
<18-23,ZACK>好吧  没错  他是有个计划
<18-23,ZACK>Okay, look, fine, he had a plan.

557
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,800
<18-23,ZACK>但不是杀了海利  他想找到斯凯
<18-23,ZACK>But it wasn't to kill Hayley. He wanted to find Sky.

558
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,180
<18-24,BECKETT>为什么
<18-24,BECKETT>Why?

559
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,280
<18-25,ZACK>他听说斯凯和海利又开始来往了
<18-25,ZACK>He heard that Sky and Hayley were talking again.

560
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,240
<18-25,ZACK>他想我去贿赂她
<18-25,ZACK>He wanted me to grease her wheels a bit.

561
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,700
<18-26,CASTLE>什么  用你的无穷魅力吗
<18-26,CASTLE>Oh, what, with your vast array of charms?

562
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,760
<18-27,ZACK>麦克尼金斯让我给她毒品
<18-27,ZACK>Mcginnis wanted me to give her dope

563
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,210
<18-27,ZACK>让她去和海利谈谈
<18-27,ZACK>And have her talk to Hayley

564
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,980
<18-27,ZACK>然后拿回乐队名所有权
<18-27,ZACK>And get the band name back.

565
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,280
<18-27,ZACK>他知道只有通过斯凯才能接近海莉
<18-27,ZACK>He knew that the only way to get to Hayley was through Sky.

566
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,030
<18-27,ZACK>所以我就让她吸毒
<18-27,ZACK>So I got her wasted, okay?

567
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,630
<18-27,ZACK>吸得有点太多了
<18-27,ZACK>A little too wasted.

568
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,250
<18-27,ZACK>我就自己去找了海利
<18-27,ZACK>And I went to go see Hayley myself.

569
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,120
<18-28,BECKETT>你在海利被杀的那晚见到过她
<18-28,BECKETT>You saw Hayley the night that she was killed?

570
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,330
<18-28,BECKETT>你之前应该告诉我们的  扎克
<18-28,BECKETT>You should've told us that, Zack.

571
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,060
<18-29,ZACK>干嘛  让自己嫌疑更大吗
<18-29,ZACK>What, make me look even more guilty to you guys?

572
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,830
<18-29,ZACK>我才没那么傻  我看电视的
<18-29,ZACK>No. I watch TV.

573
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,740
<18-29,ZACK>我知道陪审团是怎么做事的
<18-29,ZACK>I know how the jury works.

574
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,740
<18-29,ZACK>这些小蛛丝马迹就会让你被定罪
<18-29,ZACK>These little things get you convicted

575
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,020
<18-30,CASTLE>对警察说谎也会
<18-30,CASTLE>So does lying to cops

576
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,760
<18-31,BECKETT>说下去  说完
<18-31,BECKETT>Keep going. Spill it.

577
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,470
<18-32,ZACK>她在一个咖啡屋
<18-32,ZACK>She was at a coffeehouse.

578
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,390
<18-32,ZACK>她又开始写歌
<18-32,ZACK>She was writing songs again.

579
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,410
<18-32,ZACK>之前都好好的直到她电话响了
<18-32,ZACK>E-everything was fine until her phone rang.

580
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,150
<18-33,BECKETT>发生了什么
<18-33,BECKETT>What happened?

581
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,680
<18-34,ZACK>她吓坏了
<18-34,ZACK>She freaked.

582
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,010
<18-34,ZACK>她按了"忽略"
<18-34,ZACK>She hit "ignore,"

583
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,170
<18-34,ZACK>但每次她挂断之后  电话又响
<18-34,ZACK>But every time she did, it just rang again.

584
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,860
<18-34,ZACK>电话每响一次  她变得更害怕
<18-34,ZACK>And every time it rang, she just flipped out even more.

585
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,260
<18-35,CASTLE>你知道那是谁吗
<18-35,CASTLE>You have any idea who it was?

586
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,640
<18-36,ZACK>知道  他们打了很多次
<18-36,ZACK>Yeah, because they called so many times,

587
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,080
<18-36,ZACK>我看到了来电显示
<18-36,ZACK>I saw the caller I.D.

588
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,660
<18-36,ZACK>我看到之后也吓了一跳
<18-36,ZACK>It scared me when I saw it, too.

589
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:20,230
<18-36,ZACK>上面显示是死神来电
<18-36,ZACK>It said it was Death calling.

590
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,450
<19-1,CASTLE>我以为她没有电话
<19-1,CASTLE>I thought she didn't have a phone?

591
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,470
<19-2,BECKETT>她也许不想留下任何痕迹  用付费电话
<19-2,BECKETT>She probably had a pay-as-you-go plan, paid cash,

592
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,230
<19-2,BECKETT>然后给电话公司留下错误的信息
<19-2,BECKETT>And gave the phone company false information.

593
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,310
<19-3,CASTLE>如果她想避开死神  并如斯凯所说避开
<19-3,CASTLE>Well, that makes sense if she was hiding from death

594
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,070
<19-3,CASTLE>通信网络的话  这样做就讲得通了
<19-3,CASTLE>And trying to stay off the grid like Sky said.

595
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,110
<19-4,BECKETT>那么  很明显
<19-4,BECKETT>Okay, so obviously,

596
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,680
<19-4,BECKETT>电话是人打来的
<19-4,BECKETT>There's a human being at the other end of the phone.

597
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,800
<19-4,BECKETT>而那个不知名的人跟踪了她
<19-4,BECKETT>And whoever it is probably tracked her down

598
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,960
<19-4,BECKETT>然后杀了她
<19-4,BECKETT>And then killed her.

599
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,220
<19-4,BECKETT>那么谁会比较有可能
<19-4,BECKETT>So who had the dubious distinction

600
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,060
<19-4,BECKETT>会被海利称为"死神"
<19-4,BECKETT>Of being known by Hayley as "death"?

601
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,930
<19-5,CASTLE>好  那首歌是怎么唱的
<19-5,CASTLE>Okay. well, how does the song go?

602
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,470
<19-5,CASTLE>"死神  她就在附近"
<19-5,CASTLE>"Death, she grows near."

603
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,000
<19-5,CASTLE>"她“  死神是个女人
<19-5,CASTLE>"she"--death is a woman.

604
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,160
<19-6,BECKETT>明白你的意思
<19-6,BECKETT>Okay, following you so far.

605
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,910
<19-7,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯说海利
<19-7,CASTLE>Okay, Alexis says that Hayley

606
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,080
<19-7,CASTLE>喜欢在她的歌里应用塔罗牌里的话
<19-7,CASTLE>Liked to draw from tarot cards in her writing.

607
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,000
<19-7,CASTLE>在塔罗牌里  死神并不代表死亡
<19-7,CASTLE>And in tarot cards, Death isn't death.

608
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,060
<19-7,CASTLE>死神表示改变
<19-7,CASTLE>Deah means change.

609
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,510
<19-8,BECKETT>那么她并不是在躲避死神
<19-8,BECKETT>Okay, so she wasn't hiding from Death.

610
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,450
<19-8,BECKETT>她在逃避改变
<19-8,BECKETT>She was hiding from change.

611
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,890
<19-9,CASTLE>她讨厌奥巴马
<19-9,CASTLE>She hated Obama.

612
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,920
<19-10,BECKETT>谁是改变的化身呢
<19-10,BECKETT>Who was the embodiment of change?

613
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,580
<19-10,BECKETT>什么样的女人代表了
<19-10,BECKETT>What woman represented

614
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,120
<19-10,BECKETT>海利生活中最大的改变呢
<19-10,BECKETT>the bigest change in Hayley's life?

615
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,880
<19-10,BECKETT>送她去戒毒的人
<19-10,BECKETT>The one who sent her to rehab.

616
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,870
<19-10,BECKETT>挽救了她人生的人
<19-10,BECKETT>The one who saved her life.

617
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,820
<19-11,CASTLE>布雷·布什
<19-11,CASTLE>Bree Busch?

618
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,300
<19-11,CASTLE>为什么她的制作人要害她
<19-11,CASTLE>Why would Hayley's producer want to hurt her?

619
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,380
<19-12,BECKETT>我不知道  但值得查一下
<19-12,BECKETT>I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

620
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,900
<19-13,CASTLE>是你在哭吗
<19-13,CASTLE>Are you crying?

621
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,660
<19-15,BECKETT>我在唱她的歌
<19-15,BECKETT>I was singing her words.

622
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,230
<19-16,SKY>我能听到她的声音
<19-16,SKY>I could hear her voice.

623
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,420
<19-16,SKY>我能感觉到她  就像她在这里
<19-16,SKY>I could feel her, like she was here.

624
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,600
<19-17,BECKETT>那是因为你妹妹很坚强
<19-17,BECKETT>That's because your sister was strong.

625
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,010
<19-17,BECKETT>你以为她又开始吸毒
<19-17,BECKETT>You thought that she was using again.

626
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,460
<19-17,BECKETT>但其实她没有  她已经戒掉了
<19-17,BECKETT>But she wasn't. She was clean.

627
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,930
<20-1,CASTLE>希望我们能做点什么
<20-1,CASTLE>I wish there was something we could do.

628
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,360
<20-1,CASTLE>我们不能把她送到戒毒所或做点别的吗
<20-1,CASTLE>Can't we send her to rehab or something?

629
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,920
<20-2,BECKETT>在她自己准备戒掉前  没人能帮她
<20-2,BECKETT>No one can help her until she's ready to get clean.

630
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,710
<20-3,RYAN>我弄到了对布雷·布什的调查执行令
<20-3,RYAN>So I called in the warrants you wanted on Bree Busch.

631
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,280
<20-3,RYAN>要一天时间才能拿到她的电话记录
<20-3,RYAN>Phone records are gonna take a day,

632
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,070
<20-3,RYAN>但信用卡记录显示  10点48分她买过东西
<20-3,RYAN>But her credit card puts her in the city at 10:48.

633
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,970
<20-3,RYAN>刚才我查看了一下谈话记录
<20-3,RYAN>Now I checked our interview notes.

634
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,650
<20-3,RYAN>她说10点她在布鲁克林的家里
<20-3,RYAN>She said she was at home in Brooklyn at 10:00.

635
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,200
<20-4,BECKETT>那么10点48分她又在哪里
<20-4,BECKETT>Where was she at 10:48?

636
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,880
<20-5,RYAN>在12大道和19大道之间的一个药店
<20-5,RYAN>At a pharmacy at 12th and 19th.

637
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,680
<20-6,CASTLE>-那儿离犯罪现场有三个街区  -是的
<20-6,CASTLE>- That's three blocks from the crime scene.  - Yeah.

638
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,740
<20-7,ESPOSITO>我在想她到底买了些什么
<20-7,ESPOSITO>Made me wonder what she was shopping for,

639
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,380
<20-7,ESPOSITO>然后我给那药店打了电话
<20-7,ESPOSITO>So I called the store.

640
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,880
<20-7,ESPOSITO>他们传真过来一张收据
<20-7,ESPOSITO>They faxed over a receipt.

641
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,500
<20-8,BECKETT>一瓶水  巧克力
<20-8,BECKETT>Bottle of water, energy bar...

642
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,130
<20-8,BECKETT>和达妮埃拉·博兰熔岩热吻红色天鹅绒唇膏
<20-8,BECKETT>And a tube of Daniella Bolan velvet kiss lava red lipstick.

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,700
<20-9,CASTLE>和海利脸上的那款唇膏是一样的
<20-9,CASTLE>That's the same lipstick used to paint a smile on Hayley's face.

644
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,100
<21-1,BREE BUSCH>好吧  是这样的
<21-1,BREE BUSCH>Okay, it's true.

645
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,460
<21-1,BREE BUSCH>她死的那晚我见过她
<21-1,BREE BUSCH>I saw her the night she died.

646
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,500
<21-2,BECKETT>之前你为什么不告诉我们这点
<21-2,BECKETT>Why didn't you tell us that before?

647
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:52,300
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>那天她给工作室打来电话
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>She had called the studio earlier that day.

648
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,630
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>是我的助手凯利接的电话
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>She spoke to my assistant Kelly, okay?

649
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,330
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>她说她要过来拿点东西
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>She said she wanted to come by and pick up some stuff

650
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,410
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>她把吉他和一些设备忘这儿了
<21-3,BREE BUSCH>She'd left behind-- a guitar and some pedals.

651
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,790
<21-4,BECKETT>那样你就得到了她的新号码
<21-4,BECKETT>That's how you got her new number.

652
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,420
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>我马上给她回了电话
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>I called her back immediately.

653
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,320
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>你知道  我一直给她打
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>You know, I kept calling.

654
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,860
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>她不接
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>She wouldn't pick up.

655
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,940
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>我给她发了无数条短信
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>I must have left half a dozen messages.

656
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,330
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>最后  我给她留了条信息说
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>So finally I-I, you know, left her a message saying,

657
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,680
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>"今晚过来  老地方"
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>"Come by tonight, you know."

658
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,240
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>"有人会把你的东西给你"
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>"Someone will be here to give you your stuff."

659
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,090
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>但我没告诉她是我  于是她就来了
<21-5,BREE BUSCH>And I didn't tell her it was gonna be me, so she showed.

660
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,350
<21-6,BECKETT>那是几点钟
<21-6,BECKETT>What time was that?

661
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,770
<21-6,BECKETT>哦  大概11点
<21-6,BECKETT>Oh, about 11:00.

662
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,320
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>我说  "除非你告诉我到底怎么回事"
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>Anyway, I-I said, "I'm not gonna give you your stuff

663
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,550
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>"否则我不会把东西给你"
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>"Unless you tell me what's going on,"

664
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,950
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>你知道吗
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>You know?

665
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,900
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>她甚至看都不看我  你得明白
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>She wouldn't even look at me. You have to understand, um,

666
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,440
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>我投了那么多钱到这张唱片里面
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>I had put so much money into this record,

667
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,730
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>如果她不完成的话  我就要失去工作室
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>If she didn't finish it, I was gonna lose the studio.

668
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,840
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>我得让她留下来  懂吗
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>So I had to get her to stay, right?

669
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,100
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>反正她也在吸毒
<21-7,BREE BUSCH>Mm. uh, she was using anyway.

670
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,860
<21-8,CASTLE>是你给了她毒品
<21-8,CASTLE>You offered her drugs.

671
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,130
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>一袋  我给了她一袋
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>A bag. I offered her a bag.

672
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,510
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>我说"还有更多"
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>I said, "there's plenty more where that came from."

673
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,900
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>我本该
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>Well, I-I would've, uh...

674
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,280
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>在她戒毒之后帮助她的
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>Gotten her help after she finished.

675
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,980
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>但我不想让她离开
<21-9,BREE BUSCH>I couldn't let her walk away.

676
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,830
<21-10,BECKETT>但问题就在这  布什太太
<21-10,BECKETT>Yeah. well, here's the thing, Mrs. Busch--

677
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,530
<21-10,BECKETT>海利死时是清白的  她没在吸毒
<21-10,BECKETT>Hayley was clean when she died. she wasn't using.

678
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,690
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>后来我才知道
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>Well, I know that now.

679
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,670
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>当时  她解开上衣
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>I mean, she-- she opened up her jacket

680
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,620
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>给我看了里面藏着的东西  是一把枪
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>And showed me what was tucked inside--a gun.

681
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,800
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>她有一把枪
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>I mean, she had a gun.

682
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,470
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>她说"我宁愿自杀"
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>And she said, "I would rather put a bullet in my brain

683
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,930
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>"也不要再吸毒"
<21-11,BREE BUSCH>"Than to be using again."

684
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,220
<21-12,BECKETT>让我重述一下整个过程
<21-12,BECKETT>Let me make sure I'm getting this right.

685
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,640
<21-12,BECKETT>你假装为她好  想诱惑她
<21-12,BECKETT>You lured Hayley here under false pretenses,

686
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,610
<21-12,BECKETT>而给她毒品  但却引起激烈争吵
<21-12,BECKETT>Offered her drugs, got into a heated argument,

687
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,410
<21-12,BECKETT>你想说她是活着走出去的吗
<21-12,BECKETT>And you're telling me that she walked out of that door alive?

688
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,640
<21-13,CASTLE>你什么时候换的这隔板上的镜板
<21-13,CASTLE>When did you replace the panel on this baffle?

689
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,320
<21-14,BREE BUSCH>我不记得有换过
<21-14,BREE BUSCH>I-I don't think it's ever been replaced.

690
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,370
<21-15,CASTLE>有换过  这块比其他的要新一些
<21-15,CASTLE>Yeah, it has. It's newer than the other ones.

691
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,830
<21-16,BREE BUSCH>你能小心一点吗
<21-16,BREE BUSCH>Could you be careful, please?

692
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,660
<21-16,BREE BUSCH>那些设备很贵的
<21-16,BREE BUSCH>That's expensive equipment.

693
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,350
<21-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干什么
<21-17,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

694
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,130
<21-18,CASTLE>很明显  我在这里找到了一个弹孔
<21-18,CASTLE>Apparently, I'm uncovering a bullet hole.

695
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,920
<21-19,BECKETT>从洞孔直径来看  是一把点38口径的枪
<21-19,BECKETT>Judging from the diameter of the hole, it's a .38.

696
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,850
<21-19,BECKETT>海利手上还有开枪后的痕迹
<21-19,BECKETT>That gunpowder residue on Hayley's hands?

697
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,600
<21-20,CASTLE>这就是开枪的地点
<21-20,CASTLE>This is where the gun was fired.

698
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,760
<22-1,BREE BUSCH>我不知道那儿怎么会有弹孔
<22-1,BREE BUSCH>I have no idea how that bullet hole got there.

699
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,540
<22-2,BECKETT>你和海利争吵
<22-2,BECKETT>You and Hayley fought.

700
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,470
<22-2,BECKETT>你知道如果她走了
<22-2,BECKETT>You knew that if she walked out that door,

701
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,760
<22-2,BECKETT>你就再也找不到她了
<22-2,BECKETT>You would never see her again.

702
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,860
<22-2,BECKETT>所以你从后面抓住了她
<22-2,BECKETT>And so you grabbed her from behind.

703
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,380
<22-2,BECKETT>她拿出了枪  你吓坏了
<22-2,BECKETT>She pulled out a gun. It scared you.

704
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,320
<22-2,BECKETT>你抓得更紧了  她开了一枪
<22-2,BECKETT>You held her tight. A shot went off.

705
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,770
<22-2,BECKETT>你依旧紧紧抓着她
<22-2,BECKETT>You held her tighter still,

706
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,220
<22-2,BECKETT>你不明白发生了什么
<22-2,BECKETT>And before you even knew what happened,

707
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,250
<22-2,BECKETT>她就停止了挣扎
<22-2,BECKETT>She stopped struggling.

708
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,340
<22-2,BECKETT>而你没意识到已经扭断了她的脖子
<22-2,BECKETT>You broke her neck without realizing it.

709
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,860
<22-3,BREE BUSCH>不是这样的
<22-3,BREE BUSCH>That's not what happened.

710
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,000
<22-3,BREE BUSCH>事实根本不是这样的
<22-3,BREE BUSCH>That's not what happened at all.

711
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,600
<22-4,BECKETT>如果这是个意外  是自卫不当的话
<22-4,BECKETT>If it was an accident, if it was an act of self-defense,

712
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,870
<22-4,BECKETT>你只要告诉我们事实
<22-4,BECKETT>You're gonna make this all easier on yourself

713
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,290
<22-4,BECKETT>事情就简单得多
<22-4,BECKETT>Just by telling us the truth.

714
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,130
<22-5,MONTGOMERY>她如果认罪将会被判5年
<22-5,MONTGOMERY>She's gonna do 20 years

715
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,130
<22-5,MONTGOMERY>不认就是20年
<22-5,MONTGOMERY>Instead of pleading out and doing five.

716
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,830
<22-6,CASTLE>因为内心愧疚还是律师差劲吗
<22-6,CASTLE>Guilty conscience or lousy lawyer?

717
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,750
<22-7,IAN BUSCH>求你了布雷  我不能让你蹲20年
<22-7,IAN BUSCH>Bree, please. I can't lose you for 20 years.

718
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,960
<22-8,BREE BUSCH>我不能说谎  我没有害死她
<22-8,BREE BUSCH>I can't lie. I didn't hurt her!

719
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,220
<22-8,BREE BUSCH>事实不是这样的
<22-8,BREE BUSCH>That's not what happened.

720
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,260
<22-9,MONTGOMERY>看来要靠律师了
<22-9,MONTGOMERY>I guess it's up to the lawyer now

721
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,250
<23-1,BECKETT>回家告诉阿丽克西斯这个消息
<23-1,BECKETT>You goin' home to tell Alexis the news?

722
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,890
<23-2,CASTLE>只是想出去走走
<23-2,CASTLE>Just thought I'd go for a walk.

723
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,550
<23-3,BECKETT>有哪里特别想去的吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Anyplace in particular?

724
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,580
<23-4,CASTLE>一想到她孤伶伶的我就很难受
<23-4,CASTLE>It kills me thinking about her out there alone.

725
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,780
<23-5,BECKETT>走吧  我来开车
<23-5,BECKETT>Come on. I'll drive.

<24-5,BECKETT>Can you hear me?

734
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,220
<24-5,BECKETT>你吸了多少
<24-5,BECKETT>How much did you take?

735
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,330
<24-6,SKY>麦克尼金斯给了我们应得的奖励
<24-6,SKY>Mcginnis gave us a signing bonus.

<24-6,SKY>他告诉了我们能便宜买到货的地方
<24-6,SKY>He told us a place we could fix for cheap.

<24-6,SKY>可我没办法去
<24-6,SKY>Mm. I couldn't do it.

738
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,970
<24-6,SKY>海利不希望我这么做
<24-6,SKY>No, Hayley didn't want me to.

739
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,180
<24-7,SKY>我现在清白了
<24-7,SKY>I c... I'm clean.

<24-7,SKY>She's gonna help me, right?

<24-7,SKY>Wherever she is...

742
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,430
<24-7,SKY>她都会帮我的  对吗
<24-7,SKY>She's looking out for me, right?

743
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,020
<24-8,BECKETT>她已经这么做了
<24-8,BECKETT>She's already doing it.

744
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,770
<24-9,CASTLE>来  我们带你离开这
<24-9,CASTLE>Come on. Let's get you out of here.

745
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,340
<25-1,ALEXIS>斯凯会没事的  对吗
<25-1,ALEXIS>Is Sky going to be okay?

746
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,770
<25-2,CASTLE>我认为她会的
<25-2,CASTLE>I think so.

747
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,310
<25-2,CASTLE>最难熬的时期过去了
<25-2,CASTLE>The worst part is over.

748
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,500
<25-2,CASTLE>现在她只需要过好剩下的日子
<25-2,CASTLE>Now she just has to figure out the rest of her life.

749
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,630
<25-3,ALEXIS>海利呢
<25-3,ALEXIS>And Hayley?

750
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,470
<25-3,ALEXIS>整件事难道只是个愚蠢的意外
<25-3,ALEXIS>The whole thing was just some stupid accident?

751
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,580
<25-3,ALEXIS>太没意义了
<25-3,ALEXIS>It's just so pointless.

752
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,210
<25-4,CASTLE>我知道
<25-4,CASTLE>I know.

753
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,490
<25-4,CASTLE>当我们失去一个喜欢的歌手时
<25-4,CASTLE>Sometimes when we lose an artist we like,

754
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,540
<25-4,CASTLE>就好比失去一个好朋友一样
<25-4,CASTLE>It's kinda like losing a friend.

755
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,150
<25-4,CASTLE>我记得约翰·列侬死的时候
<25-4,CASTLE>You know, I remember when John Lennon died...

756
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,990
<25-4,CASTLE>我躲在房间里一周没出来
<25-4,CASTLE>I didn't leave my room for a week.

757
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,120
<25-5,ALEXIS>她只有25岁
<25-5,ALEXIS>She was only 25.

758
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,760
<25-5,ALEXIS>我无法想象她没办法再写歌了
<25-5,ALEXIS>I can't help but think about all the songs she won't write

759
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,730
<25-5,ALEXIS>我们也听不到她的歌声了
<25-5,ALEXIS>That we won't get to hear now.

760
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,130
<25-5,ALEXIS>只因为制作人认为她又吸毒了
<25-5,ALEXIS>And all because a producer thought she was back on drugs...

761
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,930
<25-5,ALEXIS>她怎么会那样想
<25-5,ALEXIS>Why would she even think that?

762
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,320
<25-6,CASTLE>当我们关心的人
<25-6,CASTLE>You know, when people we care about

763
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,700
<25-6,CASTLE>突然背叛我们的时候
<25-6,CASTLE>Suddenly turn against us,

764
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,790
<25-6,CASTLE>我们会找各种理由去掩饰
<25-6,CASTLE>We can come up with all sorts of reasons to explain it.

765
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,270
<25-6,CASTLE>但谁知道真相是怎么回事呢
<25-6,CASTLE>Who knows what really happened?

766
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,620
<25-6,CASTLE>我说完了  你还不睡吗
<25-6,CASTLE>Well, that's it for me. You stayin' up?

767
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,010
<25-7,ALEXIS>可以吗  我只是想再多听一会
<25-7,ALEXIS>Is it okay? i just want to listen a little longer.

768
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,410
<25-8,CASTLE>当然可以
<25-8,CASTLE>Of course.

769
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,360
<25-9,ALEXIS>请你倾听  我解释给你听
<25-9,ALEXIS>"I can explain if you're listening."

770
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,400
<25-9,ALEXIS>请你倾听  我解释给你听
<25-9,ALEXIS>"I can explain if you're listening."

771
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,450
<25-11,ALEXIS>怎么了  爸爸
<25-11,ALEXIS>What, dad?

772
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,880
<25-12,CASTLE>这首歌是她死前一周写的
<25-12,CASTLE>She wrote that song a week before she died,

773
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,990
<25-12,CASTLE>在她离开制作人去找警察之后
<25-12,CASTLE>After she left her producers and went to the cops.

774
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,620
<25-12,CASTLE>可能她想告诉我们发生了什么
<25-12,CASTLE>Maybe she's trying to tell us what was going on.

775
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,470
<25-12,CASTLE>被锁沉默里  活生生的地狱中
<25-12,CASTLE>"Locked up in silence, a living hell."

776
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,300
<25-13,ALEXIS>戒毒所
<25-13,ALEXIS>Rehab?

777
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,770
<25-14,CASTLE>或者制作人家里
<25-14,CASTLE>Or her producers.

778
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,740
<25-15,ALEXIS>曾拯救我的  挚爱的你
<25-15,ALEXIS>"The loving hand that saved me."

779
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,970
<25-16,CASTLE>她的制作人  布雷和伊恩  等等
<25-16,CASTLE>Her producers Bree and Ian? Wait.

780
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,790
<25-17,CASTLE>她歌词里说"它的"黑暗还是"他的"
<25-17,CASTLE>What is she saying there, "its darkness" or "his darkness"?

781
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,800
<25-19,CASTLE>你越过了我的底线  你怎么能这样
<25-19,CASTLE>"You stepped across my threshold. How could you?"

782
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,510
<25-20,ALEXIS>天哪  爸爸
<25-20,ALEXIS>Oh, god, dad.

783
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,660
<25-20,ALEXIS>这和我想的是一个意思吗
<25-20,ALEXIS>Does that mean what I think it means?

784
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,020
<25-21,CASTLE>意思就是  我们抓错凶手了
<25-21,CASTLE>It means... We have the wrong killer.

785
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,550
<26-1,BECKETT>凶手的身份在歌词里面
<26-1,BECKETT>The identity of our killer is in the song?

786
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,000
<26-2,CASTLE>没错  你听
<26-2,CASTLE>It's right there. Listen.

787
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,720
<26-3,BECKETT>我知道  我听过
<26-3,BECKETT>I know. I already heard it.

788
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,250
<26-3,BECKETT>你认为如果海利知道谁想杀她
<26-3,BECKETT>Don't you think that if Hayley knew who was gonna kill her,

789
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,440
<26-3,BECKETT>她肯定会阻止这次谋杀的
<26-3,BECKETT>She would've tried to prevent the murder?

790
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,810
<26-3,BECKETT>现在为止每件事都不符合逻辑
<26-3,BECKETT>It never make sense up to now.

791
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,860
<26-4,CASTLE>要是真的一切顺利
<26-4,CASTLE>Why would she have to disappear

792
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,350
<26-4,CASTLE>她又何必要躲起来呢
<26-4,CASTLE>When everything seemed to be going so well?

793
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,470
<26-4,CASTLE>就在歌词里  她唱出来了
<26-4,CASTLE>It's in the words. She even says it.

794
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,190
<26-4,CASTLE>请你倾听  我给你解释
<26-4,CASTLE>"I can explain if you're listening."

795
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,150
<27-1,BREE BUSCH>就这样放我走了吗
<27-1,BREE BUSCH>Just like that, I'm free to go?

796
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,450
<27-1,BREE BUSCH>你可以走了
<27-1,BREE BUSCH>Just like that.

797
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,450
<27-2,BECKETT>你需要填些释放文件表格
<27-2,BECKETT>You need to sign a few release forms,

798
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,560
<27-2,BECKETT>如果你不介意的话
<27-2,BECKETT>If you don't mind.

799
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:44,950
<27-4,BREE BUSCH>非常感谢
<27-4,BREE BUSCH>Thank you so much.

800
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,940
<27-4,BREE BUSCH>你们找到真正的凶手了吗
<27-4,BREE BUSCH>Does this mean you found the real killer?

801
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,560
<27-5,BECKETT>我们马上去逮捕凶手
<27-5,BECKETT>We're about to make arrest,

802
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,490
<27-6,BREE BUSCH>太好了
<27-6,BREE BUSCH>That's great.

803
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
<27-7,CASTLE>你知道更奇妙的是
<27-7,CASTLE>You know what's even better is it

804
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,780
<27-7,CASTLE>是海利告诉我们谁是凶手
<27-7,CASTLE>was Hayley herself who led us to her killer.

805
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,760
<27-8,BREE BUSCH>她怎么做到的
<27-8,BREE BUSCH>How'd she do that?

806
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,930
<27-9,CASTLE>她最后一首歌
<27-9,CASTLE>Her last song.

807
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,850
<27-9,CASTLE>她被害那晚唱的那首
<27-9,CASTLE>The one that was playing the night she died.

808
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,190
<27-9,CASTLE>网上已经传开了  你们应该知道
<27-9,CASTLE>It's all over the web. You know the one.

809
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,620
<27-11,CASTLE>歌词提醒了我
<27-11,CASTLE>It's the lyrics that really get me.

810
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,450
<27-11,CASTLE>里面有许多隐含意思
<27-11,CASTLE>There's so many layers.

811
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,550
<27-11,CASTLE>听了很久我才明白
<27-11,CASTLE>It took me a few listens to get to the bottom of them.

812
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,720
<27-12,BECKETT>开始听的时候
<27-12,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. first time I heard it,

813
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,890
<27-12,BECKETT>我以为是关于戒毒所
<27-12,BECKETT>I thought it was about going into rehab.

814
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,420
<27-13,IAN BUSCH>确实是这样  走出黑暗的深渊
<27-13,IAN BUSCH>But it is. It's about coming from a dark place

815
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,220
<27-13,IAN BUSCH>重新勇敢面对生活
<27-13,IAN BUSCH>And having the courage to get on with your life.

816
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,620
<27-14,CASTLE>不同的黑暗  听
<27-14,CASTLE>Different dark place. Listen.

817
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,720
<27-14,CASTLE>这段里提到了
<27-14,CASTLE>This is the part that gives it away.

818
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,400
<27-15,HAYLEY BLUE>你越过了我的底线  你怎么能这样
<27-15,HAYLEY BLUE>"You stepped across my threshold. How could you?"

819
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,370
<27-16,BREE BUSCH>我不明白
<27-16,BREE BUSCH>I don't understand.

820
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,500
<27-17,CASTLE>有人超越了她的底线  她不愿意这样
<27-17,CASTLE>Somebody crossed over her threshold. She didn't want him to.

821
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,100
<27-18,BECKETT>有人威逼她做某些事
<27-18,BECKETT>Someone forced himself on her.

822
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,820
<27-19,IAN BUSCH>你们根据歌词推断出这么多东西
<27-19,IAN BUSCH>You're getting all that from a song?

823
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,220
<27-20,CASTLE>还有另外一些地方很明显
<27-20,CASTLE>Well, there's other places where it's more overt.

824
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,700
<27-20,CASTLE>但如果你听这些歌词
<27-20,CASTLE>But if you listen to the words,

825
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,750
<27-20,CASTLE>仔细分析  就能明白
<27-20,CASTLE>Analyze them, it's all there.

826
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:59,450
<27-20,CASTLE>父亲一样的形象  背叛
<27-20,CASTLE>Father figure, betrayal...

827
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,020
<27-20,CASTLE>性侵犯
<27-20,CASTLE>Violation.

828
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,580
<27-20,CASTLE>实在太可怕了
<27-20,CASTLE>It's truly awful.

829
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,710
<27-21,BREE BUSCH>为什么她什么都没说
<27-21,BREE BUSCH>Why didn't she say anything?

830
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:10,020
<27-21,BREE BUSCH>伊恩  她和你说过什么吗
<27-21,BREE BUSCH>Ian, did she ever say anything to you?

831
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,820
<27-22,IAN BUSCH>没有  她没有过
<27-22,IAN BUSCH>No. no, she didn't.

832
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,740
<27-23,BECKETT>你把海利被害那晚  和她争吵的事
<27-23,BECKETT>You told your husband about arguing with Hayley

833
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,210
<27-23,BECKETT>告诉了你丈夫  对吗
<27-23,BECKETT>The night she was killed, didn't you?

834
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,620
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>没错  我从工作室回家时  他正好在家
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>Yes. He was there when I got home from the studio.

835
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,920
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>我把整件事都告诉了他
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>I told him the whole thing.

836
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:25,220
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>我当时很烦躁 吃了安眠药就睡了
<27-24,BREE BUSCH>Uh, I was so upset, I took a sleeping pill to get some rest.

837
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,990
<27-25,CASTLE>就是那时你拿了她的手机
<27-25,CASTLE>That's when you borrowed your wife's cell phone

838
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,990
<27-25,CASTLE>还有她的新口红
<27-25,CASTLE>And her brand-new lipstick.

839
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,620
<27-25,CASTLE>很巧的是  我们查到了
<27-25,CASTLE>It's a good thing we'd subpoenaed

840
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,250
<27-25,CASTLE>你夫人的通话记录
<27-25,CASTLE>Your wife's phone records

841
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,850
<27-25,CASTLE>同时  我还神奇地联想到歌词的内容
<27-25,CASTLE>When I had this whole crazy lyric idea.

842
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,820
<27-25,CASTLE>否则  我们就不知道
<27-25,CASTLE>Otherwise, we might have missed out

843
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,690
<27-25,CASTLE>你给海利发的那些短信息了
<27-25,CASTLE>On those texts you sent Hayley.

844
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,690
<27-26,BREE BUSCH>什么短消息
<27-26,BREE BUSCH>What texts?

845
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,040
<27-27,BECKETT>短信是11:52从你的手机发送的
<27-27,BECKETT>Text from your phone at 11:52

846
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,820
<27-27,BECKETT>伊恩都告诉我了  我得和你谈谈
<27-27,BECKETT>"Ian told me the whole thing. We have to talk right away."

847
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,940
<27-27,BECKETT>工作室见
<27-27,BECKETT>"Meet me at the studio."

848
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,050
<27-28,BREE BUSCH>我从没发过这个
<27-28,BREE BUSCH>I never sent that text.

849
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,120
<27-29,BECKETT>11:54  很抱歉他对你做的一切
<27-29,BECKETT>11:54 "I'm so sorry for what he did to you."

850
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,990
<27-29,BECKETT>我要离开他  请来和我谈谈
<27-29,BECKETT>"I'm leaving him. Please come talk to me."

851
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,320
<27-29,BECKETT>最后11:56  来自海利的回复
<27-29,BECKETT>And finally at 11:56, a reply from hayley.

852
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,890
<27-29,BECKETT>工作室见
<27-29,BECKETT>"See you there."

853
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,950
<27-30,BREE BUSCH>你干了什么
<27-30,BREE BUSCH>What did you do?

854
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,380
<27-30,BREE BUSCH>挚爱的你  将我逼入绝境
<27-30,BREE BUSCH>"The loving hand that saved me held too tight."

855
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,550
<27-31,CASTLE>他假装是你
<27-31,CASTLE>He pretended to be you

856
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,230
<27-31,CASTLE>因为就是他威逼海利
<27-31,CASTLE>Because he was the one who forced himself on Hayley.

857
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,920
<27-31,CASTLE>他怕她把真相说出来
<27-31,CASTLE>He was afraid she was gonna talk,

858
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,650
<27-31,CASTLE>所以装成你
<27-31,CASTLE>So he pretended.

859
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,710
<27-31,CASTLE>当海利意识到
<27-31,CASTLE>By the time Hayley realized

860
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,880
<27-31,CASTLE>是伊恩在办公室等她时
<27-31,CASTLE>It was Ian waiting for her at the office,

861
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,610
<27-31,CASTLE>已经太迟了
<27-31,CASTLE>It was too late.

862
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,010
<27-32,BREE BUSCH>伊恩
<27-32,BREE BUSCH>Ian?

863
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,110
<27-32,BREE BUSCH>伊恩
<27-32,BREE BUSCH>Ian?!

864
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,250
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>我没有威逼海利
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>I didn't force myself on Hayley.

865
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,130
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>是她勾引的我  从她来的那天开始
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>She seduced me, from the time she moved in

866
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,000
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>对我说话的口气   触摸我的方式
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>The way she talked to me, the way she touched me.

867
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,150
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>现在我们为她做了一切
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>And now after all we'd done for her,

868
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,750
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>她却编造谎言来摧毁我们的婚姻
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>She was gonna make up this lie to destroy our marriage

869
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,310
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>毁坏我们的事业
<27-33,IAN BUSCH>And ruin our our business?

870
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,030
<27-34,CASTLE>-不可能  -所以你拧断了她的脖子
<27-34,CASTLE>- No. - So you snapped her neck.

871
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,180
<27-34,CASTLE>她的枪没起任何作用  对吗
<27-34,CASTLE>The gun didn't do her any good, did it?

872
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,550
<27-34,CASTLE>你比她强壮多了
<27-34,CASTLE>You were too strong,

873
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,410
<27-34,CASTLE>就像你侵犯她的那晚一样
<27-34,CASTLE>Just like the night when you assaulted her.

874
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,110
<27-34,CASTLE>是你杀了她
<27-34,CASTLE>You killed her.

875
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,780
<27-34,CASTLE>你差点就逃脱了
<27-34,CASTLE>And you almost gonna away with it.

876
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,000
<27-34,CASTLE>但海利还是开了口  不是吗
<27-34,CASTLE>But Hayley wouldn't shut up, would she?

877
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,850
<27-35,BECKETT>你很狡猾
<27-35,BECKETT>That was pretty smart,

878
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,110
<27-35,BECKETT>精心的布置犯罪现场
<27-35,BECKETT>Staging the crime scene like the stalker video,

879
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,210
<27-35,BECKETT>看起来像是别人干的
<27-35,BECKETT>Making it look like someone else did it.

880
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,080
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>她把你当父亲一样尊敬你
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>She loved you like a father.

881
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,910
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>她仰慕你的那种眼神
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>The way she looked up to you...

882
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,950
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>让我更加迷恋你
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>It made me love you more.

883
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,950
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>看着我
<27-36,BREE BUSCH>Look at me.

884
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,150
<27-37,IAN BUSCH>我想请个律师
<27-37,IAN BUSCH>I'd like a lawyer now.

885
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,110
<28-1,BECKETT>布雷知道了她丈夫
<28-1,BECKETT>Bree turned on her husband

886
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,190
<28-1,BECKETT>对海利做了什么之后哭个不停
<28-1,BECKETT>The moment she found out what he had done to Hayley.

887
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,950
<28-1,BECKETT>而且勿庸置疑  她提出了离婚
<28-1,BECKETT>Needless to say, she's filed for divorce.

888
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,630
<28-2,CASTLE>难怪海利不跟布雷说一声就逃走了
<28-2,CASTLE>No wonder Hayley couldn't tell Bree why she ran away.

889
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,920
<28-3,BECKETT>她找不到合适的对象
<28-3,BECKETT>You see, she didn't have anyone to talk to.

890
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,220
<28-3,BECKETT>所以她只能做一件事  写出来
<28-3,BECKETT>So she did the one thing that she could. She wrote about it.

891
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,370
<28-4,CASTLE>这让我想起  我写那本
<28-4,CASTLE>That kinda reminds me of when I wrote

892
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,840
<28-4,CASTLE>《屠杀将至》时的心情
<28-4,CASTLE>"When it comes to slaughter."

893
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,960
<28-4,CASTLE>我一直想要
<28-4,CASTLE>It was at a time in my life when I was just

894
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,480
<28-4,CASTLE>一种想要搞清楚  不重要了
<28-4,CASTLE>I was trying to work through... it's not important.

895
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,570
<28-5,MONTGOMERY>所以他认罪了
<28-5,MONTGOMERY>So is he pleading out?

896
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,580
<28-6,BECKETT>肯定的  帕尔马特在他外衣里
<28-6,BECKETT>Oh, he can try. Perlmutter ran his coat and found

897
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,700
<28-6,BECKETT>发现了和海利身上相同的火药残留
<28-6,BECKETT>The same gun powder residue that found in Hayley.

898
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,340
<28-6,BECKETT>估计要坐一段牢了
<28-6,BECKETT>He is going away for a long time.

899
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,210
<28-6,BECKETT>很好
<28-6,BECKETT>Good.

900
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,430
<28-7,MONTGOMERY>干得漂亮  你们俩都是
<28-7,MONTGOMERY>Nice job. Both of you.

901
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,850
<28-8,BECKETT>你准备怎么跟阿丽克西斯说
<28-8,BECKETT>So what are you gonna tell Alexis?

902
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,210
<28-9,CASTLE>像以往一样
<28-9,CASTLE>What I always tell her,

903
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,050
<28-9,CASTLE>实话实说
<28-9,CASTLE>The truth.

904
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,830
<29-1,SKY>海利·玛利亚·布鲁  我们爱你想你
<29-1,SKY>Hayley Maria Blue, we love and miss you.

905
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,840
<29-1,SKY>这首歌献给你
<29-1,SKY>The song's for you.
