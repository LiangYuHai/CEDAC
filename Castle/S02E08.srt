<2-15,ESPOSITO>The victim is Caleb Shimansky, an on-duty bike messenger.

78

80
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,090
<2-15,ESPOSITO>然后嫌犯偷走了他的包裹
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Then the suspect steals the messenger bag,

81
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,390
<2-15,ESPOSITO>跳上车  一溜烟跑了
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Jumps in his ride and jets off.

86
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,240
<2-19,BECKETT>我猜应该有很多证人
<2-19,BECKETT>I'm assuming we have plenty of witnesses.

87
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,440
<2-20,ESPOSITO>不少  有3人记下了嫌犯的车牌号
<2-20,ESPOSITO>Several. Three of them got the suspect's license plate number.

88
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,110
<2-21,CASTLE>这就像是戳穿了骗子的把戏
<2-21,CASTLE>Aw, man. It's like having a cheat code.

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,480
<2-21,CASTLE>有多个证人和车牌号
<2-21,CASTLE>You've got multiple witnesses and a license plate number?

94
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,530
<2-23,CASTLE>显然他想要的是那个包裹
<2-23,CASTLE>And obviously wanted what was ever in that messenger bag.

95
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,810
<2-24,RYAN>那包被害人要送的东西  包裹或是纸盒

<2-26,CASTLE>都重要到需要杀死快递员
<2-26,CASTLE>It was important enough to kill the messenger.

329
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,380
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>这十年来  你从没问过是谁联络他
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>Over ten years, you never asked who his contact was,

330
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,870
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>是谁接洽他  是谁付你钱吗
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>Who approached him, who was paying you?

331
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,380
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>你只是装作什么都不知道  收钱就好
<8-24,MONTGOMERY>You just conveniently never bothered to ask?

332
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,020
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>我问过  但布莱迪认为
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>I asked! But Brady felt that

333
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,670
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>我知道得越少就越安全
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>The less I knew, the safer I would be.

334
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,100
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>连那个包裹都没写回邮地址
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>Even the packages didn't have a return address.

335
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,280
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>上尉  我丈夫刚刚遇害
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>Look, Captain, my husband was just killed.

336
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,480
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>我已经知无不言
<8-25,VALERIE THOMPSON>I'm telling you all I know.

337
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,770
<9-1,BECKETT>好吧  我们目前所掌握的
<9-1,BECKETT>Okay, so what we know so far

338
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,210
<9-1,BECKETT>就是大约四个月前
<9-1,BECKETT>Is that about four months ago,

339
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,960
<9-1,BECKETT>给布莱迪的酬劳开始迟到
<9-1,BECKETT>The payments to Brady started arriving late,

340
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,120
<9-1,BECKETT>减少  甚至最后  停寄了
<9-1,BECKETT>Short and then finally, not at all.

341
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,340
<9-1,BECKETT>据他妻子所言  因此布莱迪决定
<9-1,BECKETT>And according to the wife, that's when Brady decided

342
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,950
<9-1,BECKETT>寄出他的保险单
<9-1,BECKETT>To messenger over his insurance policy.

343
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,910
<9-1,BECKETT>来证明自己的清白
<9-1,BECKETT>That was supposed to prove his innocence.

344
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,670
<9-2,ESPOSITO>不管是谁付钱给他
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Our patsy Brady had to be in communication

345
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,910
<9-2,ESPOSITO>布莱迪肯定一直在跟他联系
<9-2,ESPOSITO>With whoever was making payments.

346
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,790
<9-3,RYAN>监狱应该有布莱迪会客谈话的记录
<9-3,RYAN>Prison should have a record of everyone Brady talked to.

347
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,600
<9-4,MONTGOMERY>我们查过电话记录了  一无所获
<9-4,MONTGOMERY>We already checked his phone logs. There's nothing there.

348
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,580
<9-6,MONTGOMERY>-电邮呢  -马上去查
<9-6,MONTGOMERY>- How about email? - We're running it down.

349
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,340
<9-7,CASTLE>不管布莱迪说过什么  反正奏效了
<9-7,CASTLE>Well, whatever Brady said, it worked.

350
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,610
<9-7,CASTLE>他的酬劳又按时送达  直到一个月前  又停了
<9-7,CASTLE>Payments started up again, then a month ago, nothing.

351
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,110
<9-8,RYAN>没准布莱迪受够了这情况
<9-8,RYAN>Think maybe Brady got fed up with the situation?

352
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,330
<9-8,RYAN>他想反正对方
<9-8,RYAN>Figured if whoever he made the deal with

353
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,130
<9-8,RYAN>自己都没遵守  那他也不必坚持了
<9-8,RYAN>Wasn't holding up their end of the bargain, why was he?

354
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,420
<9-9,BECKETT>然后他联系了他姨妈萨利
<9-9,BECKETT>Then he calls up his Aunt Sally,

355
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,460
<9-9,BECKETT>叫她把能证明自己清白的证据
<9-9,BECKETT>Asks her to send the evidence that proves his innocence

356
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,570
<9-9,BECKETT>寄给负责逮捕他的警官
<9-9,BECKETT>To the arresting officer.

357
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,280
<9-10,CASTLE>有没可能有人在监听他的电话
<9-10,CASTLE>Is it possible someone was monitoring his calls?

358
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,550
<9-10,CASTLE>不管是谁杀了快递员
<9-10,CASTLE>I mean, whoever killed our bike messenger

359
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,230
<9-10,CASTLE>肯定是收到了包裹寄出的消息
<9-10,CASTLE>Had to have been tipped off the package was in motion.

360
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,130
<9-11,MONTGOMERY>唯一能监听电话的  就是监狱工作人员
<9-11,MONTGOMERY>The only people that monitor calls are prison staff.

361
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,600
<9-12,ESPOSITO>十年来  每月七千美金  那可就是百万美金
<9-12,ESPOSITO>$7,000 a month for 10 years is almost $1 million total.

362
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,560
<9-12,ESPOSITO>不管我们在查的是谁  很显然
<9-12,ESPOSITO>Whoever we're dealing with obviously has the means

363
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,810
<9-12,ESPOSITO>他有的是收买人的办法
<9-12,ESPOSITO>To buy somebody off.

364
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,120
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>查一下监狱的轮值表
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>Get the duty roster from the prison.

365
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,050
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>看布莱迪打电话时是谁当值
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>See who was working when Brady made his calls.

366
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,740
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>为他老婆孩子办好证人保护计划
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>Set up a protection detail for the wife and the kid.

367
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,160
<9-14,BECKETT>已经办好了  长官
<9-14,BECKETT>It's already done, sir.

368
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,110
<9-15,BECKETT>上尉  你有认罪口供和证据
<9-15,BECKETT>Captain, you had the confessions, the evidence.

369
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,060
<9-15,BECKETT>每个人都会做出相同的决定
<9-15,BECKETT>Anyone would've come to the same conclusion.

370
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,270
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>我不够努力  还以为可以结案了
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>I didn't push hard enough.  I knew this case was off.

371
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,860
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>每件事情都这么有条不紊
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>Everything just fell into place so perfectly.

372
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,080
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>看看现在什么情况
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>Now what have we got?

373
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,420
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>和凶手毫无关联的人无辜被害
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>An innocent bystander with no connection to the killer.

374
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,640
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>而且根本没有物证
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>And without physical evidence,

375
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,100
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>根本无法确定谁开的那辆车
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>There's no way of tracking who was driving that car.

376
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,880
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>想从狱中凶犯那找到突破口
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>And catching a break on a prison murder?

377
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,820
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>可没那么容易
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>That's a long shot,

378
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,070
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>尤其这事还牵涉到腐败案
<9-16,MONTGOMERY>Especially if you're dealing with a corrupt guard.

379
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,620
<9-17,BECKETT>但我们手中还有十年前那桩杀人案
<9-17,BECKETT>But we still have the original murder from ten years ago.

380
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,950
<9-17,BECKETT>一切事情从那里开始
<9-17,BECKETT>Everything started there.

381
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,520
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>刚出了两桩凶杀案  你却想去查
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>Two fresh bodies, and you want to look

382
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,930
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>十年前的老案子
<9-18,MONTGOMERY>At a murder 10years cold?

383
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,680
<9-19,CASTLE>就拿我写小说来说
<9-19,CASTLE>Uh... When I'm writing a story,

384
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,810
<9-19,CASTLE>万事总是开头难
<9-19,CASTLE>The beginning is always the hardest,

385
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,800
<9-19,CASTLE>但只要起了个好头
<9-19,CASTLE>But if you nail that,

386
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,310
<9-19,CASTLE>其他的自然就不在话下了
<9-19,CASTLE>The rest of it could just fall into place.

387
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,690
<9-20,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔  这不是你的小说
<9-20,MONTGOMERY>Castle, this is not one of your books.

388
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,000
<9-21,CASTLE>但这是个谜  所有的谜案都是一样的
<9-21,CASTLE>No, but it is a mystery, and all mysteries are the same--

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
<9-21,CASTLE>动机  机会  掩饰  良知
<9-21,CASTLE>Motive, opportunity, cover-up, conscience.

390
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,530
<9-21,CASTLE>今天的两起命案  是为了掩盖十年前的案子
<9-21,CASTLE>These murders today were to cover up one ten years ago.

391
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,520
<9-21,CASTLE>那线索就该从那查起
<9-21,CASTLE>That's where your leads are gonna be.

392
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,760
<9-21,CASTLE>上尉  你觉得呢
<9-21,CASTLE>Come on, Captain. What do you say?

393
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,820
<9-21,CASTLE>咱们就来小小缅怀下往事吧
<9-21,CASTLE>Let's take a little trip down memory lane.

394
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,270
<10-1,BECKETT>奥利维亚·德比西  20岁
<10-1,BECKETT>Olivia Debiasse, 20 years old.

395
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,730
<10-1,BECKETT>邻居发现她陈尸自家公寓
<10-1,BECKETT>Neighbors found her bludgeoned to death in her apartment.

396
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,040
<10-2,CASTLE>她公寓肯定少了什么
<10-2,CASTLE>Hmm. There were some things missing from her apartment.

397
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,890
<10-2,CASTLE>不论是谁杀了她
<10-2,CASTLE>Whoever killed her

398
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,220
<10-2,CASTLE>都想让这看起来是一起抢劫案
<10-2,CASTLE>Tried to make it look like a robbery gone wrong.

399
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,980
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>我们调查的那位勤杂工
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>There should be something in there

400
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,990
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>肯定跟这事多少有点关系
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>About a handyman that we looked at for it.

401
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,060
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>他有案底  而且就在那楼里工作
<10-3,MONTGOMERY>He had a criminal record, he worked in the building.

402
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,630
<10-4,CASTLE>是他干的话  我可真入错了行
<10-4,CASTLE>If it was him, I'm in the wrong line of work.

403
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,590
<10-4,CASTLE>勤杂工月收入7000块
<10-4,CASTLE>$7,000 a month for a handyman?

404
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,560
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>有证据指向布莱迪后  就排除了他
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>We moved off him once we moved on Brady.

405
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>后来接到了个匿名线报
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>An anonymous tip came in.

406
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>那会来说还真够及时的
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>Felt like a break at the time.

407
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,900
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>我们抓了他  审了大概
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>Yeah, brought him in, leaned on him for, what,

408
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,920
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>估计最多半小时  他就招了
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>Maybe a half-hour before he broke.

409
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,680
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>知道吗  很有趣的是
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>You know, it's funny.

410
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,560
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>我从未真正看过这些报告
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>I-I never actually even looked at some of these reports

411
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,550
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>因为检调单位送来的时候
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>Because once the canvassing detectives turned them in,

412
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,150
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>布莱迪早就被羁押了
<10-5,MONTGOMERY>We already had Brady in custody.

413
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,200
<10-6,BECKETT>上面说了 奥利维亚被害当晚
<10-6,BECKETT>Well, it says here that Olivia went to a party earlier

414
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,590
<10-7,MONTGOMERY>-先去参加了派对  -是在皮尔逊俱乐部
<10-7,MONTGOMERY>- The night she was killed.- It says here the Pierson Club.

415
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,300
<10-7,MONTGOMERY>皮尔逊俱乐部
<10-7,MONTGOMERY>The Pierson Club?

416
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,930
<10-8,CASTLE>那可是上流社会聚集地
<10-8,CASTLE>That's high society.

417
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,610
<10-8,CASTLE>那可是犯罪的温床
<10-8,CASTLE>That's crime de la crime.

418
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,950
<10-8,CASTLE>我的钱只够存银行  他们的钱足够买下银行
<10-8,CASTLE>My money goes in banks. Their money buys banks.

419
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,510
<10-9,BECKETT>长官  听听这个  一名女服务生说
<10-9,BECKETT>Sir, listen to this. A waitress gave a statement

420
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,070
<10-9,BECKETT>她看到奥利维亚在派对上和一名男子
<10-9,BECKETT>Saying that she saw Olivia having a heated argument

421
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,300
<10-9,BECKETT>发生了激烈争吵
<10-9,BECKETT>With a man at the party.

422
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,780
<10-10,CASTLE>-阴谋味浓了  -这里没提名字
<10-10,CASTLE>- The plot thickens.  - Mmhmm. There's no name,

423
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,070
<10-11,BECKETT>但根据她所描述的
<10-11,BECKETT>But according to the description she gave,

424
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:05,260
<10-11,BECKETT>他二十多岁  中等身材
<10-11,BECKETT>He was in his mid20s, medium build,

425
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,560
<10-11,BECKETT>身穿蓝色外衣  戴橙色条纹领带
<10-11,BECKETT>Wearing a blue blazer and an orange striped tie.

426
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,980
<10-12,CASTLE>我不知道你们怎么看
<10-12,CASTLE>Ooh, I don't know about you guys.

427
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,160
<10-12,CASTLE>我看就是个有钱的纨绔子弟在那泡妞
<10-12,CASTLE>But I am getting a delicious millionaire playboy vibe here.

428
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,190
<10-13,BECKETT>女服务生记得
<10-13,BECKETT>The waitress was under the impression

429
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,200
<10-13,BECKETT>他是跟奥利维亚一起来的
<10-13,BECKETT>That he arrived with Olivia.

430
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,300
<10-14,MONTGOMERY>奥利维亚最好的朋友是她的同事
<10-14,MONTGOMERY>Olivia's best friend was a gal that she worked with.

431
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,250
<10-14,MONTGOMERY>也许她知道奥利维亚当时跟谁在一起
<10-14,MONTGOMERY>Maybe she could tell us who Olivia hung out with.

432
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,690
<10-15,RYAN>帕穆特刚重新看了
<10-15,RYAN>Perlmutter just finished reviewing

433
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,850
<10-15,RYAN>奥利维亚当时的尸检报告
<10-15,RYAN>Olivia's autopsy report from back in the day.

434
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,790
<10-15,RYAN>他说有所发现
<10-15,RYAN>He says he found something.

435
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,830
<10-16,MONTGOMERY>你们去停尸房
<10-16,MONTGOMERY>You guys take the morgue.

436
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,280
<10-16,MONTGOMERY>-我跟进奥利维亚的朋友这边  -谢谢  长官
<10-16,MONTGOMERY>- I'll follow-up on Olivia's friend. - Thank you, sir.

437
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,840
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>我重新看了看德比西女士的资料
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>I've gone through Ms. Debiasse's files,

438
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,830
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>她的尸检报告实在乏善可陈
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>And her autopsy was fairly limited.

439
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,370
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>我猜是因为布莱迪认罪了
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>I assume, when Brady confessed,

440
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,190
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>法医就觉得没必要太过仔细
<11-1,PERLMUTTER>The M.E. decided not to be thorough.

441
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,430
<11-2,BECKETT>他漏了什么吗
<11-2,BECKETT>Did he miss something?

442
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,640
<11-4,CASTLE>-这很难说  -你直觉怎么认为
<11-4,CASTLE>- It's hard to say. - What does your gut tell you?

443
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,490
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>我直觉认为  我现在很饿  但是
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>My gut tells me I'm hungry, but I'm not

444
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,590
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>在打发你们俩之前  我是吃不上东西的
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>Gonna be able to eat until I'm done with the two of you,

445
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,760
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>所以我就痛快告诉你们
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>So why don't I just tell you

446
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,970
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>我训练有素的法医技能告诉我
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>What my keen M.E. Training tells me?

447
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,240
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>布莱迪说他是用棒球棒袭击奥利维亚
<11-5,PERLMUTTER>All right, Brady said he hit Olivia with a baseball bat.

448
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,260
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>但看看这里  从这些伤口
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>But look at these. When I look at these wounds

449
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,580
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>和她颅骨骨折的情况来看
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>And the skull fracture pattern,

450
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,220
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>我认为这绝不是球棒所伤
<11-6,PERLMUTTER>I'm just not seeing a baseball bat strike.

451
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,720
<11-7,BECKETT>布莱迪说谎说杀了人
<11-7,BECKETT>Brady lied about killing her.

452
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,490
<11-7,BECKETT>所以胡说行凶手法  也不稀奇
<11-7,BECKETT>He might have lied about what was used to do it.

453
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,890
<11-7,BECKETT>你能确定她是怎么死的吗
<11-7,BECKETT>Can you determine how she was killed?

454
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,090
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>我只能凭推测
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>It'd only be speculating.

455
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,280
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>要证实的话  得给她头骨照X光才成
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>To do it properly, I'd have to x-ray the skull

456
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,530
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>还得检查她的遗骸
<11-8,PERLMUTTER>And examine the remains.

457
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,840
<11-9,CASTLE>你想掘出她的遗体
<11-9,CASTLE>You want to exhume the body?

458
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,600
<11-10,PERLMUTTER>这是唯一的办法
<11-10,PERLMUTTER>The only way to do it right.

459
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,300
<11-10,PERLMUTTER>再说  谁知道还能不能有其他发现
<11-10,PERLMUTTER>Plus, who knows what else I might find?

460
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,300
<11-11,BECKETT>奥利维亚由母亲养大  母亲也已过世
<11-11,BECKETT>Olivia was raised by a single mom who's deceased as well.

461
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,570
<11-11,BECKETT>我找找她的亲戚  看能帮上什么
<11-11,BECKETT>So let me call the next of kin and see what I can do.

462
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,200
<11-12,BECKETT>抱歉
<11-12,BECKETT>Excuse me.

464
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,730
<11-13,CASTLE>你确定在这吃东西卫生吗
<11-13,CASTLE>You sure it's sanitary to be eating here?

465
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,560
<11-14,PERLMUTTER>你知道我们这用什么消毒剂吗
<11-14,PERLMUTTER>You know the strength of the disinfectants we use here?

466
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,190
<11-14,PERLMUTTER>全市就数这房间最干净
<11-14,PERLMUTTER>This is the cleanest room in the city.

467
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,500
<11-15,CASTLE>-我吃不下去  -爱心便当哦
<11-15,CASTLE>- I couldn't.  - Homemade.

468
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,690
<11-17,CASTLE>-我咽不下  -有进展了
<11-17,CASTLE>- I couldn't. - Caught a break.

469
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,560
<11-18,BECKETT>上尉找死者朋友谈过了
<11-18,BECKETT>The Captain talked to the friend.

470
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,630
<11-19,CASTLE>-她记得奥利维亚和谁一起吗  -杰夫·迪伦翰
<11-19,CASTLE>- Does she remember who Olivia was with? - Jeff Dilahunt

471
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,180
<11-20,BECKETT>法律咨询公司的合伙人
<11-20,BECKETT>Who's had his fair share of run-ins with the law.

472
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,180
<11-20,BECKETT>而且他的信托基金价值数百万美金
<11-20,BECKETT>And he has a trust fund worth millions.

473
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,630
<11-21,CASTLE>每月支付七千美金是绰绰有余
<11-21,CASTLE>Enough to pay $7,000 a month.

474
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,360
<11-21,CASTLE>-答对了  -太好了
<11-21,CASTLE>- Bingo.  - Boo-yah.

475
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,050
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>我和奥利维亚是在夜店认识的
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>Uh, I met Olivia at a nightclub.

476
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,480
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>她来城里才不久
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>She hadn't been in town long,

477
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,060
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>但感觉参加派对已是如鱼得水
<12-1,JEFF DILAHUNT>But, uh, she seemed like a real party girl.

478
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,590
<12-2,BECKETT>你们俩当时在恋爱吗
<12-2,BECKETT>Were the two of you dating?

479
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,910
<12-3,JEFF DILAHUNT>没  我们只是朋友
<12-3,JEFF DILAHUNT>Uh, no. Just friends.

480
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,660
<12-3,JEFF DILAHUNT>-怎么  男女就不能只当朋友吗  -拜托
<12-3,JEFF DILAHUNT>- What, can't a guy and a girl just be friends? - Please.

481
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,260
<12-5,JEFF DILAHUNT>你们俩在一起了吗
<12-5,JEFF DILAHUNT>Are you two together?

482
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,820
<12-7,BECKETT>-还没  -绝对没有
<12-7,BECKETT>- Not yet.  - Absolutely not.

483
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,670
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>和她的事没什么大不了
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>Look, it was, uh, no big deal.

484
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,810
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>我偶然提起我的一位校友
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>I happened to mention that a school friend of mine

485
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,560
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>要在皮尔逊俱乐部办个家族聚会
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>Was having a family reunion here at the Pierson Club

486
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,080
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>邀请我去参加
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>And asked me to stop by.

487
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,380
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>奥利维亚很想去  我就带上了她
<12-8,JEFF DILAHUNT>Olivia really wanted to come. So I took her.

488
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,800
<12-9,CASTLE>谁会想去参加别人的家族聚会
<12-9,CASTLE>Who would want to go to someone else's family reunion?

489
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,070
<12-10,JEFF DILAHUNT>我想这得看是哪个家族了
<12-10,JEFF DILAHUNT>Well, I suppose that all depends on the family.

490
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,970
<12-10,JEFF DILAHUNT>那次可是威尔士利家族的聚会
<12-10,JEFF DILAHUNT>In this case, it happened to be the Wellesleys.

491
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,790
<12-11,BECKETT>就是那个威尔士利家族
<12-11,BECKETT>The w-- the "Wellesleys" Wellesleys?

492
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,690
<12-11,BECKETT>那个财大势大的威尔士利家族
<12-11,BECKETT>The rich and powerful Wellesleys?

493
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,330
<12-11,BECKETT>保守党的那个  纽约威尔士利家族
<12-11,BECKETT>The conservative, New York Wellesleys?

494
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,110
<12-12,BECKETT>那不是某个参议员家族吗
<12-12,BECKETT>Wasn't that one of our senators?

495
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,640
<12-13,CASTLE>是的  卡斯帕·威尔士利参议员
<12-13,CASTLE>Yeah, he was. Senator Casper Wellesley. Oh.

496
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,680
<12-13,CASTLE>九十年代初期去世  他的孩子今年
<12-13,CASTLE>He died in the early '90s. His kid's running for his seat

497
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,310
<12-14,JEFF DILAHUNT>-再次参加了竞选  -我跟你说
<12-14,JEFF DILAHUNT>- Again this year. - Well, I'll tell you what,

498
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,860
<12-14,JEFF DILAHUNT>下次我接到邀请时  会带你一起去
<12-14,JEFF DILAHUNT>Next time I'm invited, I'll take you.

499
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,060
<12-15,BECKETT>迪伦翰先生  她被害当晚10点到凌晨2点
<12-15,BECKETT>Mr. Dilahunt, where were you between 10:00 P.M. and 2:00 A.M.

500
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,210
<12-15,BECKETT>你在哪里
<12-15,BECKETT>The night that she was killed?

501
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,040
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>我和几个威尔士利家族的表亲
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>Okay, well, a couple of, uh, Wellesley cousins and I

502
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,510
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>从派对溜走去泡吧了
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>Bailed early and went clubbing.

503
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,610
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>我想当时我可能
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>I believe there may have been

504
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,830
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>喝多了点玻利维亚的什么烈酒
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>Bolivian marching powder involved.

505
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,040
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>我们因公共场合醉酒而被捕
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>We got picked up for public intoxication.

506
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,660
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>我父亲让他们放弃了起诉  不过
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>My father got the charges dropped, but, uh,

507
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,820
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>被捕记录还是没有撤销
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>There's still a record of our arrest.

508
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,590
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>你们要是找不到  我家还有装裱好的复印件
<12-16,JEFF DILAHUNT>If you can't find it, I have a framed copy at home

509
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,440
<12-17,BECKETT>当晚你和奥利维亚发生了争执吗
<12-17,BECKETT>Did you have an argument with Olivia that night

510
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,470
<12-17,BECKETT>-或见她和谁发生过争执  -都没有
<12-17,BECKETT>- Or see anyone else who did?  - No.

511
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,820
<12-19,BECKETT>有位女服务生看到奥利维亚跟一位
<12-19,BECKETT>A witness saw Olivia having it out

512
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,060
<12-19,BECKETT>穿蓝夹克  戴橙色条纹领带的男子发生争执
<12-19,BECKETT>With a man in a blue blazer and an orange striped tie.

513

<12-19,BECKETT>你想想  这个人会是谁
<12-19,BECKETT>Do you remember anyone who fit that description?

<12-21,JEFF DILAHUNT>The, uh, blazers are standard,

517
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,630

<12-22,CASTLE>Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

520
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,620
<12-23,BECKETT>对  我们的嫌疑人多了去了
<12-23,BECKETT>Yep. We got a hell of a lot of suspects.

<13-2,MONTGOMERY>局里破案率下降了3%  他们大为不爽
<13-2,MONTGOMERY>And they get upset when our closure rate drops 3%.

526
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,680
<13-2,MONTGOMERY>除非天降奇迹才可能有转机
<13-2,MONTGOMERY>You ask me, we're working miracles to do what we're doing.

527
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,960
<13-3,RYAN>有更紧要的话  我们稍后再谈
<13-3,RYAN>Sir, we can do this later if you have a higher priority.

528
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,800
<13-4,MONTGOMERY>永远别让工作妨碍了正事
<13-4,MONTGOMERY>Never let the job get in the way of the job.

529
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,330
<13-4,MONTGOMERY>有什么进展
<13-4,MONTGOMERY>Where were we?

530
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,740
<13-5,ESPOSITO>布莱迪和他的联系人
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Well, Brady and his contact communicated through

531
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,490
<13-5,ESPOSITO>通过假邮箱帐号联系
<13-5,ESPOSITO>A dummy email account.

532
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,810
<13-5,ESPOSITO>我们想追踪邮件地址  但一无所获
<13-5,ESPOSITO>We tried to trace the address, but it was a dead end.

533
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,080
<13-6,MONTGOMERY>狱警那边有什么进展
<13-6,MONTGOMERY>Where are we with reviewing the guards?

534
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,810
<13-7,RYAN>一无所获  监狱长拒绝提供值班表
<13-7,RYAN>No where. The warden refuses to provide the duty roster.

535
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,530
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他说假设他的属下有问题
<13-8,ESPOSITO>He said that he was offended

536
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,210
<13-8,ESPOSITO>是我们对他的冒犯
<13-8,ESPOSITO>We assume that one of his men was dirty.

537
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,820
<13-8,ESPOSITO>他想要自己内部解决
<13-8,ESPOSITO>He wants to handle it in house.

538
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,370
<13-9,MONTGOMERY>是吗  我可不接受
<13-9,MONTGOMERY>Yeah? Well, that doesn't work for me.

539
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,290
<14-1,BECKETT>有没有谁像是在派对上
<14-1,BECKETT>Do any of these men look like the one

540
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,480
<14-1,BECKETT>同奥利维亚争吵的人
<14-1,BECKETT>That you saw arguing with Olivia the night of the party?

541
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,160
<14-2,EDWINA>十年前我只是个傻乎乎的服务生
<14-2,EDWINA>Look, it was a stupid waitress job ten years ago.

542
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,330
<14-2,EDWINA>你还记得十年前你在干什么吗
<14-2,EDWINA>Do you remember what you were doing ten years ago?

543
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,300
<14-3,CASTLE>你还记得一些细节吗
<14-3,CASTLE>Can you recall any details?

544
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,310
<14-3,CASTLE>他是否戴眼镜  有没有纹身
<14-3,CASTLE>Was he wearing glasses? Did he have a tattoo?

545
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,280
<14-4,EDWINA>我只知道当时  那个男人在吼那个女孩
<14-4,EDWINA>All I know is that the man was yelling at the girl.

546
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,260
<14-4,EDWINA>他非常恼怒  把酒都给洒了
<14-4,EDWINA>He got so riled up, he spilled his wine.

547
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,500
<14-4,EDWINA>最后是我清理了地毯上的污渍
<14-4,EDWINA>And I ended up cleaning it off the carpet.

548
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,130
<14-5,CASTLE>有洒到他自己身上吗
<14-5,CASTLE>Did he spill any on himself?

549
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,680
<14-6,EDWINA>我不知道  可能有
<14-6,EDWINA>I don't know. Maybe.

550
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,850
<14-6,EDWINA>他
<14-6,EDWINA>Him!

551
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,600
<15-1,BECKETT>特伦特·威尔士利吗
<15-1,BECKETT>Trent Wellesley?

552
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,760
<15-1,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<15-1,BECKETT>I'm detective Kate Beckett

553
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,780
<15-1,BECKETT>纽约警局的
<15-1,BECKETT>NYPD.

554
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,870
<15-1,BECKETT>我需要和你谈谈
<15-1,BECKETT>I need to have a word.

555
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,800
<15-2,TRENT WELLESLEY>是  我的老朋友杰夫说我可能受到询问
<15-2,TRENT WELLESLEY>Yes. My old friend Jeff said I might be hearing from you.

556
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,890
<15-3,LENANNE WELLESLEY>警察  他们是警察吗
<15-3,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Police? Are they the police?

557
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,360
<15-4,TRENT WELLESLEY>是的  祖母
<15-4,TRENT WELLESLEY>Yes, grandmother.

558
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,370
<15-5,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我的戒指被偷了
<15-5,LENANNE WELLESLEY>My ring was stolen.

559
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,570
<15-6,TRENT WELLESLEY>他们不是为你的事来的  祖母
<15-6,TRENT WELLESLEY>Oh, oh, they're not here for you, grandmother.

560
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,640
<15-7,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我的戒指被偷了  那个很贵
<15-7,LENANNE WELLESLEY>My ring was stolen. It's expensive

561
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,350
<15-8,FRANK DAVIS>特伦特  你们可能得到别的地方去说
<15-8,FRANK DAVIS>Trent, perhaps you should take this conversation elsewhere

562
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,160
<15-9,TRENT WELLESLEY>我明白  弗兰克  她有时候有点迷糊
<15-9,TRENT WELLESLEY>Of course, Frank. She gets a little confused sometimes

563
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,540
<15-9,TRENT WELLESLEY>好了
<15-9,TRENT WELLESLEY>Okay.

564
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
<15-10,TRENT WELLESLEY>我们快点把事情解决吧
<15-10,TRENT WELLESLEY>Let's get this over with.

565
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,320
<15-11,CASTLE>-是我  -你什么
<15-11,CASTLE>- It was me.  - It was you, what?

566
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,310
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>那晚和杰夫带来的女孩
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>I was the one who had the argument with the girl that

567
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,010
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>争吵的就是我
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>Jeff brought to the reunion that night,

568
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,530
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>那个被杀的女孩
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>The girl  who was killed.

569
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,440
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>我对她的行为举止不满  就让她离开
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>I didn't care for her behavior, so I asked her to leave.

570
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>她那样的女孩混迹于
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>Girls like that hang around

571
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,440
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>像我这样的家庭是有目的的
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>Families like mine for a reason.

572
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,770
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>她们图谋不轨
<15-12,TRENT WELLESLEY>They want something.

573
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:34,310
<15-13,BECKETT>杰夫是把她作为女伴带过来的
<15-13,BECKETT>Jeff brought her as his plus one.

574
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,110
<15-14,TRENT WELLESLEY>不过那时候他已经离开了  而她却还在
<15-14,TRENT WELLESLEY>But he had left by then, and she stayed.

575
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,480
<15-14,TRENT WELLESLEY>她试图和我的几个家人搭讪
<15-14,TRENT WELLESLEY>She tried to chat up more than one of my relatives.

576
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,710
<15-15,CASTLE>有没有比较特别的
<15-15,CASTLE>Any other in particular?

577
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,440
<15-16,TRENT WELLESLEY>你找错人了
<15-16,TRENT WELLESLEY>You're barking up the wrong tree.

578
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,580
<15-16,TRENT WELLESLEY>我们家族的人和她的死没有任何关系
<15-16,TRENT WELLESLEY>No one in my family had anything to do with what happened to her.

579
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,830
<15-17,BECKETT>有人花了近一百万美元来掩盖真凶
<15-17,BECKETT>Someone paid almost $1 million to cover up her murder.

580
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,410
<15-17,BECKETT>因此你们家族每个人都有嫌疑  包括你
<15-17,BECKETT>That makes everyone in your family a suspect, including you.

581
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,610
<15-18,TRENT WELLESLEY>相信我  如果我有那么多钱来挥霍的话
<15-18,TRENT WELLESLEY>Trust me, if I had that kind of money to throw around,

582
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,520
<15-18,TRENT WELLESLEY>我也不会在这巴结老太太了
<15-18,TRENT WELLESLEY>I wouldn't be here sucking up to the old lady.

583
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
<15-19,CASTLE>不错的辩解
<15-19,CASTLE>Nice.

584
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,020
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>你们认为我很有钱是因为我姓威尔士利
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>You think I'm rich because my last name is Wellesley

585
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,930
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>但在年幼时我父亲就过世了
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>But my dad died when I was a kid.

586
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,230
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>我和母亲很大程度上
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>Mom and me had to

587
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,560
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>是靠亲戚的救济生活
<15-20,TRENT WELLESLEY>Pretty much survive off the handouts of relatives.

588
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,240
<15-21,CASTLE>我想找个工作应该不难吧
<15-21,CASTLE>Well, I suppose getting a job would be out of the question

589
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,190
<15-22,BECKETT>你在保护谁
<15-22,BECKETT>Who are you protecting?

590
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,770
<15-22,BECKETT>你已经承认是和她争执过
<15-22,BECKETT>You already admitted to arguing with her.

591
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,740
<15-23,CASTLE>这样可不好
<15-23,CASTLE>It really does not look good.

592
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,040
<15-23,CASTLE>你们得明白
<15-23,CASTLE>You have to understand...

593
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,780
<15-24,TRENT WELLESLEY>他就像是我唯一的父亲
<15-24,TRENT WELLESLEY>He's like the only father I have.

594
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,950
<15-25,BECKETT>-你指谁  特伦特  -我叔叔温斯顿
<15-25,BECKETT>- Who are you talking about, Trent?  - My uncle Winston.

595
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,650
<15-26,TRENT WELLESLEY>他刚遭遇了痛苦的分手
<15-26,TRENT WELLESLEY>He had just been through a bad break-up.

596
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,000
<15-26,TRENT WELLESLEY>他是那种很容易被利用的人
<15-26,TRENT WELLESLEY>He's the kind of person that people try to take advantage of?

597
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,400
<15-27,CASTLE>比如谁
<15-27,CASTLE>People like who,

598
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,450
<15-27,CASTLE>奥利维亚或想从他那儿得到救济的穷亲戚
<15-27,CASTLE>Olivia or poor relations looking for a handout?

599
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,750
<15-28,TRENT WELLESLEY>我以前就看到过她和他在一起
<15-28,TRENT WELLESLEY>I'd seen her with him before.

600
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,450
<16-1,WINSTON WELLESLEY>没错  那个女孩的遭遇的确很惨
<16-1,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Yes, it was terrible, what happened to that poor girl.

601
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,760
<16-2,BECKETT>能告诉我们你和她
<16-2,BECKETT>Could you tell us about the kind of relationship

602
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,140
<16-2,BECKETT>是什么关系吗  威尔士利先生
<16-2,BECKETT>You had with her, Mr. Wellesley?

603
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,350
<16-2,BECKETT>在家庭聚会上那次是你们第一次见面吗
<16-2,BECKETT>Was the reunion the first time that you two met?

604
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,040
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>事实上  我第一次见她
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Actually, I believe I met Olivia

605
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,770
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>是在几周前的鸡尾酒会上
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>At a cocktail party a few weeks before that.

606
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,560
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>是在现代美术馆吗  我想不起来了
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Was it MOMA? I don't recall.

607
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,300
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>反正  我很中意她
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Anyway, I took a shine to her.

608
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,280
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>有魅力  有抱负
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Charming, ambitious,

609
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,870
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>外表着装不怎样  但我可以指点一下她
<16-3,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Rough around the edges, but I felt I could mentor her.

610
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,060
<16-4,CASTLE>"指点"是什么意思
<16-4,CASTLE>And by "mentor" you mean?

611
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,090
<16-5,WINSTON WELLESLEY>你在暗示什么
<16-5,WINSTON WELLESLEY>What are you suggesting?

612
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,370
<16-6,BECKETT>你侄子特伦特说
<16-6,BECKETT>Your nephew Trent said

613
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:09,360
<16-6,BECKETT>看到她整晚一直和你调情
<16-6,BECKETT>That he saw her hitting on you the whole night.

614
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,150
<16-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>那是特伦特的说法
<16-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Well, that's Trent for you.

615
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:13,540
<16-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>他总是很小心地保护这个家族
<16-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>He's always been very protective of the family.

616
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,500
<16-8,BECKETT>她被害那晚
<16-8,BECKETT>Where were you between 10:00 pm and 2:00 am

617
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,200
<16-8,BECKETT>十点到凌晨两点你在哪里
<16-8,BECKETT>On the night she was murdered?

618
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,550
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>你真的是在问我吗
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Are you seriously asking me,

619
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,080
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>问温斯顿·威尔士利要不在场证明
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Winston Wellesley, for an alibi?

620
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,370
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>看来是了
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Oh. Apparently you are.

621
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,020
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>好吧  我在家
<16-9,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Fine. I was home.

622
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,480
<16-10,BECKETT>有人能证明吗
<16-10,BECKETT>Can anyone corroborate that?

623
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,000
<16-11,WINSTON WELLESLEY>-有啊  上帝  -威尔士利先生
<16-11,WINSTON WELLESLEY>- Yes. God.  - Mr. Wellesley,

624
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,820
<16-12,BARTENDER>你的车已经准备好了
<16-12,BARTENDER>Your car is ready.

625
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,920
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>和你们的谈话很愉快
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>As delightful as this conversation has been,

626
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,380
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>但我必须走了
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I must take my leave.

627
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,070
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我得去竞选总部见我弟弟
<16-13,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I have to meet my brother at his campaign headquarters.

628
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,660
<16-14,CASTLE>没错  布莱克·威尔士利
<16-14,CASTLE>Ah, yes, Blake Wellesley,

629
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,780
<16-14,CASTLE>又一次竞选议员了
<16-14,CASTLE>Running for senate again.

630
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,450
<16-15,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我们会很感激你们的支持
<16-15,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Mm-hmm. And we'd appreciate your support.

631
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,360
<16-15,WINSTON WELLESLEY>别忘了投票
<16-15,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Don't forget to vote.

632
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,840
<16-16,CASTLE>我敢肯定他和奥利维亚有一腿
<16-16,CASTLE>I have no doubt he was having an affair with Olivia.

633
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,700
<16-16,CASTLE>但他为什么要杀她呢
<16-16,CASTLE>But why would he kill her?

634
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,000
<16-17,BECKETT>可能因为她和别人在一起而感到伤心
<16-17,BECKETT>Do you think maybe he was upset that she came with someone else?

635
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,480
<16-18,CASTLE>嫉妒  金钱  谋杀
<16-18,CASTLE>Mm, jealousy, money, murder

636
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,230
<16-18,CASTLE>有比这更好的情节吗
<16-18,CASTLE>Does it get any better than this

637
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,270
<17-1,SARA>你想挖出我侄女的尸体
<17-1,SARA>You want to exhume my niece's body?

638
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,370
<17-2,BECKETT>我们认为有关键证据
<17-2,BECKETT>We believe that there was evidence

639
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,430
<17-2,BECKETT>在验尸的时候被忽略了
<17-2,BECKETT>Overlooked during the autopsy that could lead to her killer.

640
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,870
<17-3,SARA>但你们告诉我已经抓到凶手了
<17-3,SARA>Well, you told me you caught the man.

641
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,380
<17-3,SARA>事情已经结束了
<17-3,SARA>You told me it was over.

642
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,270
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>我以为是  但杀害奥利维亚的那个人
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>I thought it was, but whoever killed Olivia.

643
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,170
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>又杀了两个人
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>Just murdered two more people.

644
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,040
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>你的侄女应该得到公正  他们也是
<17-4,MONTGOMERY>Your niece deserves justice, and so do they.

645
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,430
<17-5,SARA>她是一个那么特别的孩子
<17-5,SARA>She was such a special girl.

646
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,520
<17-5,SARA>当她妈妈的癌症恶化的时候
<17-5,SARA>She quit school...

647
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,540
<17-5,SARA>她为了照顾她而辍学
<17-5,SARA>To take care of her mother when the cancer got bad.

648
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,560
<17-6,CASTLE>这很有说服力
<17-6,CASTLE>That says a lot about her.

649
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,090
<17-6,CASTLE>她妈妈死后
<17-6,CASTLE>After her mother passed,

650
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,770
<17-7,SARA>她必须离开那个伤心之地
<17-7,SARA>It was like she had to get away.

651
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,130
<17-7,SARA>当她去了城市  我真替她高兴
<17-7,SARA>When she moved to the city, I was just so happy for her.

652
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,770
<17-7,SARA>你会  把她按原样重新下葬的吧
<17-7,SARA>You'll... Bury her back the way she was?

653
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,860
<17-8,MONTGOMERY>当然
<17-8,MONTGOMERY>Of course.

654
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,960
<17-9,SARA>至少还为她举办了像样的葬礼
<17-9,SARA>At least she had the funeral she deserved.

655
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,760
<17-9,SARA>多亏了威尔士利先生
<17-9,SARA>Thank god for Mr. Wellesley.

656
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,160
<17-10,BECKETT>威尔士利先生
<17-10,BECKETT>Mr. Wellesley?

657
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,440
<17-11,SARA>所有一切都是他付的钱
<17-11,SARA>The man who paid for everything.

658
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,190
<17-12,CASTLE>是哪个威尔士利先生
<17-12,CASTLE>Which Mr. Wellesley was that?

659
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,050
<17-13,SARA>温斯顿·威尔士利
<17-13,SARA>Winston Wellesley

660
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,780
<18-1,CASTLE>出钱为她举行葬礼
<18-1,CASTLE>Paid for her funeral?

661
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,690
<18-1,CASTLE>-是否是良心的谴责  -是
<18-1,CASTLE>- Can anyone say "guilty conscience"?  - Yeah.

662
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:14,670
<18-2,BECKETT>埃斯波西托
<18-2,BECKETT>Hey, Esposito

663
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,360
<18-2,BECKETT>调查一下温斯顿·威尔士利的不在场证明
<18-2,BECKETT>Run down Winston Wellesley's alibi.

664
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,410
<18-2,BECKETT>问问看门人  司机以及周围所有人
<18-2,BECKETT>Talk to doormen, chauffeurs, the whole gamut.

665
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,340
<18-3,ESPOSITO>我会尽力
<18-3,ESPOSITO>I'll see what I can do.

666
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,070
<18-4,BECKETT>谢谢
<18-4,BECKETT>Thank you.

667
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,970
<18-5,RYAN>这是监狱值班表
<18-5,RYAN>The prison duty roster.

668
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,890
<18-5,RYAN>该怎么查呢  长官
<18-5,RYAN>How'd you pull it off, sir?

669
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,860
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>他们让我当领导
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>They didn't make me captain

670
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,420
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>不只因为我适合坐在办公桌后面
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>Just because I look good behind a desk.

671
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,730
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>差值班表上的所有警卫人员
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>Run all the guards on that roster.

672
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,510
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>看有无不同寻常之处
<18-6,MONTGOMERY>Look for anything out of the ordinary.

673
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,690
<18-7,BECKETT>长官  我马上给公墓打电话
<18-7,BECKETT>Sir, I'm gonna call the cemetery.

674
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,360
<18-7,BECKETT>安排明天的开坟
<18-7,BECKETT>To make arrangements to exhume the body tomorrow.

675
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,410
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>我搞不懂的是
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>You know what I don't get?

676
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,090
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>不管是谁在背后操作
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>Whoever is behind this

677
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,240
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>他为什么不再付钱给布莱迪
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>Why'd he stop paying Brady?

678
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,810
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>威尔士利家族多的是钱
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>These Wellesleys have plenty of money.

679
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,040
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>如果继续付钱的话  布莱迪绝不会
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>If the money hadn't stopped, Brady never would've set off

680
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,810
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>采取行动  进而引发这一切
<18-8,MONTGOMERY>This triggering domino that started all this.

681
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,400
<18-9,CASTLE>我来给你解答  告诉你个秘密
<18-9,CASTLE>Let me let you in on a little secret.

682
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,200
<18-9,CASTLE>富人如何继续富有
<18-9,CASTLE>You know how rich people stay rich?

683
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
<18-9,CASTLE>他们很吝啬
<18-9,CASTLE>They are cheap.

684
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,110
<18-9,CASTLE>既然可以杀了布莱迪省钱
<18-9,CASTLE>Why pay for Brady for the rest of his life

685
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,750
<18-9,CASTLE>为何还要一辈子付钱给他
<18-9,CASTLE>When you can kill him for a fraction of the price?

686
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,640
<18-10,BECKETT>那他为何要等十年呢
<18-10,BECKETT>But then why would he wait ten years?

687
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,290
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>事情有变  肯定发生了什么
<18-11,MONTGOMERY>Something changed. Something must have happened.

688
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,240
<18-12,BECKETT>没错
<18-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

<18-13,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Captain Montgomery. Blake Wellesley.

690
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,640
<18-13,BLAKE WELLESLEY>很抱歉打扰你  能不能占用一点时间谈谈
<18-13,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Hate to bother you, but do you have a minute to chat?

691
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,710
<19-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>我代表我们全家向你们保证
<19-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>I speak for the entire Wellesley family

<19-2,CASTLE>但是  你继续啊  "但是"来了
<19-2,CASTLE>But? You can tell. There's a "but" coming.

694
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,850
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>不是"但是"  是"然而"
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Not a "but" a "however"

695
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,950
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>正如我说的  我们会配合  然而
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Like I said, we'll cooperate, however

696
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,550
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>我们希望不要再搞突然访问
<19-3,BLAKE WELLESLEY>We request that these unannounced interviews come to a stop

697
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,200
<19-4,BECKETT>进入正题了
<19-4,BECKETT>Here we go.

698
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,550
<19-5,MONTGOMERY>贝克特 让我们先听他说完
<19-5,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, let's hear him out.

699
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,410
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>我很抱歉这次
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>I apologize if I'm coming off

700

<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>和他们一样突然造访  警官
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Like one of those guys, detective.

701
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,410
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>只是突然造访有点让人难堪
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>It's just that these impromptu visits are a bit awkward.

702
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,680
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>我侄子特伦特
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>My nephew Trent

703
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,150
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>说你们找他谈话  当时他来看我母亲
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Said you spoke to him when he visited my mother.

704
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,150
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>母亲变得很困惑  很伤心
<19-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Mother became very confused, very upset.

705
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,750

<19-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>长官  我可以马上给你们局长打电话
<19-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Captain, I can get the commissioner on the phone in under a minute.

717
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,970
<19-13,MONTGOMERY>请便  替我向他问好
<19-13,MONTGOMERY>Well, tell him I said hi.

<19-13,MONTGOMERY>我愿意开专道迎接他
<19-13,MONTGOMERY>And I really could use a raise.

719
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,420
<19-13,MONTGOMERY>我们已无必要再谈
<19-13,MONTGOMERY>I think we're done here

720

<19-15,MONTGOMERY>不管你们在做什么  继续做
<19-15,MONTGOMERY>Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.

722
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,450
<19-15,MONTGOMERY>他们想耍花招
<19-15,MONTGOMERY>They're circling the wagons.

723

<19-16,CASTLE>你太牛了
<19-16,CASTLE>Awesome.

<20-1,MARTHA>"Accept." no.

727
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,660
<20-2,CASTLE>母亲  别犹豫了
<20-2,CASTLE>Oh, mother, come on.

728
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,960
<20-2,CASTLE>接受他的邀请吧
<20-2,CASTLE>Accept the man's friend request already.

729
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,230
<20-3,MARTHA>用那张旧照片真是个很糟糕的主意
<20-3,MARTHA>Using that old photo was a horrible idea.

730
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,650
<20-3,MARTHA>你为什么不阻止我
<20-3,MARTHA>Why didn't you stop me?

731
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,900
<20-4,CASTLE>我何时有权阻止你做任何事情
<20-4,CASTLE>Since when have I had the power to stop you from doing anything

732
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
<20-5,MARTHA>如果查特期待的是八十年代的玛莎
<20-5,MARTHA>What will Chet think if he expects 1980s-Martha,

733
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,500
<20-5,MARTHA>结果看到的却是现在的我  他会怎么想
<20-5,MARTHA>And... Pfft... Present-day Martha shows up?

734
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,320
<20-6,CASTLE>若你告诉别人我的话  我绝对不承认
<20-6,CASTLE>You tell anyone I said this and I'll deny it,

735
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,810
<20-6,CASTLE>现在我只说一次
<20-6,CASTLE>And I'm only gonna say it once.

736
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,670
<20-6,CASTLE>八十年代的玛莎很美
<20-6,CASTLE>1980s-Martha was pretty great.

737
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:02,310
<20-6,CASTLE>但现在的玛莎照样很迷人
<20-6,CASTLE>But present-day Martha...is pretty spectacular, too.

738
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,800
<20-7,MARTHA>-你刚点"接受"了吗  -是啊
<20-7,MARTHA>- Did you just accept that?  - Yeah

739
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,330
<20-9,MARTHA>-那赶紧收回  -抱歉  不能收回
<20-9,MARTHA>- Well, take it back.  - I'm sorry. I cannot

740
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,080
<20-10,CASTLE>-我  天哪  -既然已经接受了
<20-10,CASTLE>- I--oh, god.  - No, but since it's done,

741
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,750
<20-12,CASTLE>为何不去浏览一下查特的主页
<20-12,CASTLE>Why don't you take a visit to Chet's page

742
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,240
<20-12,CASTLE>看看他现在是什么样子
<20-12,CASTLE>And see what he looks like nowadays?

743
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,470
<20-13,MARTHA>是这样吗  按那个
<20-13,MARTHA>Uh, just like this? Press that?

744
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,960
<20-14,MARTHA>天  那就是查特
<20-14,MARTHA>Ooh, good l-- well, that's Chet.

745
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,580
<20-14,MARTHA>但是  那是什么时候的照片
<20-14,MARTHA>But... How old is that photo?

746
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,460
<20-15,CASTLE>看来你们彼此彼此  妈妈
<20-15,CASTLE>Turnabout is fair play, mother.

747
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,300
<20-16,MARTHA>查特·帕拉本  你在想些什么
<20-16,MARTHA>Chet Palaburn. What are you thinking, man?

748
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,690
<21-1,PERLMUTTER>一小时前工作人员把棺材送来了
<21-1,PERLMUTTER>City workers Brought the coffin in an hour ago.

749
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,790
<21-2,CASTLE>好家伙  买这口棺材温斯顿可花费不少
<21-2,CASTLE>Boy, Winston didn't spare any pennies with this box of wood.

750
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,880
<21-2,CASTLE>-这是本特利灵柩  -你提前买好啦
<21-2,CASTLE>- This is the Bentley of caskets.  - Shopping ahead?

751
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,670
<21-3,BECKETT>调查过  德里克·斯道姆在《暴风预警》中
<21-3,BECKETT>Research. Derrick Storm, in "Storm Warning,"

752
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,810
<21-4,CASTLE>发现了杀人凶器
<21-4,CASTLE>Finds a murder weapon.

753
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,530
<21-4,CASTLE>在凶手现身的一年前就被藏在棺材内
<21-4,CASTLE>Buried in a coffin a year before the murder occurs.

754
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,500
<21-4,CASTLE>我在说给谁听呢  你知道这个
<21-4,CASTLE>Who am I talking to? You know this.

755
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,540
<21-4,CASTLE>回到非小说正题
<21-4,CASTLE>Uh, back in the nonfiction section,

756
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,040
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>这里有一口埋藏了十年的真棺材
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>We have a real casket that's been sealed for ten years,

757
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,970
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>所以尸体可能已经严重腐烂
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>So there's gonna be some serious decomposition.

758
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,090
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>当我撬开它的时候
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>When I crack this open,

759
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,300
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>会有很强烈的尸臭味  做好准备
<21-5,PERLMUTTER>Expect the foulest of foul stenches.

760
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,110
<21-6,PERLMUTTER>-准备好了吗  -好了
<21-6,PERLMUTTER>- Set?  - Ok.

761
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,120
<21-9,PERLMUTTER>尸体不见了吗
<21-9,PERLMUTTER>Is the body missing,

762
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,890
<21-10,CASTLE>还是你刚表演了令人惊叹的魔术
<21-10,CASTLE>Or did you just pull off an awesome magic trick?

763
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,470
<21-10,CASTLE>你真了不起  长官
<21-10,CASTLE>You are amazing, Sir.

764
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,820
<22-1,PERLMUTTER>没有  没发现指纹
<22-1,PERLMUTTER>Nope, no prints.

765
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,440
<22-1,PERLMUTTER>移走尸体的人很小心
<22-1,PERLMUTTER>Whoever removed Olivia's remains was careful.

766
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:42,370
<22-2,CASTLE>这些人怎么会抢先我们一步
<22-2,CASTLE>How do these people manage to stay one step ahead of us?

767
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,790
<22-3,BECKETT>奥利维亚的姑姑说举行的是开放式葬礼
<22-3,BECKETT>Olivia's aunt said it was an open-casket funeral.

768
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,200
<22-3,BECKETT>那么她的尸体曾在这里
<22-3,BECKETT>So her body must have been in here at one point.

769
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,110
<22-4,CASTLE>殡葬公司肯定在葬礼和下葬的空隙
<22-4,CASTLE>The mortuary company must have switched out the bodies

770
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,480
<22-4,CASTLE>把尸体移走了
<22-4,CASTLE>Between the funeral and the burial.

771
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,980
<22-5,BECKETT>也许  但那个公司已经关门了
<22-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but the company is out of bussiness

772
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,500
<22-5,BECKETT>我们无从查找
<22-5,BECKETT>So there's no way of finding out.

773
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,950
<22-6,CASTLE>肯定是温斯顿出钱把尸体给处理了
<22-6,CASTLE>Winston had to have paid to get rid of the body

774
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,300
<22-6,CASTLE>以防布莱迪某天向警方澄清
<22-6,CASTLE>Just in case Brady ever wanted to come clean with the police.

775
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,190
<22-7,BECKETT>应该是这样
<22-7,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Looks like that.

776
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,910
<22-8,CASTLE>这家伙准备了全套应急方案
<22-8,CASTLE>This guy's got contingency plans for his contingency plans

777
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,780
<22-8,CASTLE>我们像在和超级恶棍斗智斗勇
<22-8,CASTLE>It feels like we're battling a super villain.

778
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,920
<22-9,PERLMUTTER>不好意思两位
<22-9,PERLMUTTER>Uh, excuse me, Dynamic Duo.

779
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,190
<22-10,PERLMUTTER>我该怎么处理这个呢
<22-10,PERLMUTTER>What am I doing with this?

780
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,980
<22-11,CASTLE>得看情况了
<22-11,CASTLE>Well, it depends

781
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,180
<22-11,CASTLE>最近二手棺木行情如何
<22-11,CASTLE>What can you get for a secondhand casket these days?

782
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,560
<22-12,BECKETT>我给奥利维亚的家人打电话
<22-12,BECKETT>I'll call Olivia's family

783
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,430
<22-12,BECKETT>看他们打算怎么办
<22-12,BECKETT>And find out what they want to do.

784
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,040
<22-13,CASTLE>说真的
<22-13,CASTLE>Seriously, though?

785
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,440
<22-13,CASTLE>我在想一副九成新的棺材你可以卖多少
<22-13,CASTLE>I wonder what you could get for a slightly used coffin.

786
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,070
<22-13,CASTLE>那个可是最高档的
<22-13,CASTLE>That thing is top of the line.

787
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,770
<22-13,CASTLE>-你检查过抽屉吗  -什么抽屉
<22-13,CASTLE>- Did you check the drawer?  - What drawer?

788
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,150
<22-15,CASTLE>高档棺木通常
<22-15,CASTLE>High-end coffins often have

789
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,540
<22-15,CASTLE>在里面的某个地方藏有抽屉
<22-15,CASTLE>A small drawer hidden somewhere in the lid.

790
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,320
<22-15,CASTLE>以供家人放纪念品
<22-15,CASTLE>That way families can place mementos in there

791
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,310
<22-15,CASTLE>或变态凶手隐藏证据
<22-15,CASTLE>Or psychotic killers can hide evidence.

792
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,620
<22-16,BECKETT>谢谢  对不起
<22-16,BECKETT>Thank you. Sorry.

793
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,400
<22-17,BECKETT>没什么可疑的
<22-17,BECKETT>Nothing suspicious.

794
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
<22-17,BECKETT>只是些家庭照片
<22-17,BECKETT>It's just a bunch of family photographs.

795
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,450
<22-18,CASTLE>胸章上写了什么
<22-18,CASTLE>What does that button say?

796
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,920
<22-19,BECKETT>像是政治胸章
<22-19,BECKETT>Looks like a political button.

797
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,090
<22-20,CASTLE>埃德娜·德比西  是奥利维亚的母亲吗
<22-20,CASTLE>"Edna Debiasse." Is Edna Debiasse Olivia's mother?

798
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,890
<22-20,CASTLE>把你的放大镜借给我
<22-20,CASTLE>Let me borrow your magnifying glass.

799
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,560
<22-21,BECKETT>我没有放大镜
<22-21,BECKETT>I don't have a magnifying glass.

800
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,290
<22-22,CASTLE>那不是办案的必备装备吗
<22-22,CASTLE>Isn't that standard issue for detectives?

801
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,220
<22-23,BECKETT>从福尔摩斯开始就不是
<22-23,BECKETT>No, not since Sherlock Holmes.

802
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,610
<22-24,PERLMUTTER>你可以用我的
<22-24,PERLMUTTER>You can use mine.

803
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,100
<22-26,BECKETT>卡斯帕·威尔士利  78年参议院

<22-27,CASTLE>线索都指向威尔士利
<22-27,CASTLE>All roads lead to Wellesley.

806
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,490
<23-1,BECKETT>你在看色情电影吗
<23-1,BECKETT>Are you looking at porn?

807
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,010
<23-2,CASTLE>看色情电影我会用莱恩的电脑
<23-2,CASTLE>I use Ryan's computer for that.

808
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,300
<23-2,CASTLE>我在搜索一个期刊数据库
<23-2,CASTLE>I've been searching a periodical database.

809
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,790
<23-2,CASTLE>看我发现了什么  这篇文章
<23-2,CASTLE>Look what I found. In this article,

<23-3,BECKETT>温斯顿一定认识她
<23-3,BECKETT>She and Winston had to have crossed paths.

815
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,570
<23-4,CASTLE>没错  那温斯顿为何隐瞒此事
<23-4,CASTLE>Exactly. Now why would Winston keep that from us?

<23-4,CASTLE>从布莱迪待的监狱里拿来的花名册

<24-7,MONTGOMERY>继续找  我来处理这个
<24-7,MONTGOMERY>Keep pushing on that. I'll push on this.

827
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,560
<25-1,BECKETT>威尔士利先生  我们想知道真相
<25-1,BECKETT>Mr. Wellesley, we are going to find out the truth.

828
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,220
<25-1,BECKETT>而我们能查出多少真相
<25-1,BECKETT>And the amount of dust that we kick up doing

829
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,500
<25-1,BECKETT>全取决于你的配合
<25-1,BECKETT>That is entirely up to you.

830
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,800
<25-2,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我好像想起来了  我认识她
<25-2,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I do seem to recall, uh, making her acquaintance.

831
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,100
<25-3,BECKETT>你又隐瞒了真相
<25-3,BECKETT>You're telling us half-truths again.

832
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,210
<25-3,BECKETT>我们已经知道你为奥利维亚付了丧葬费
<25-3,BECKETT>We already know that you paid for Olivia's funeral.

833
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,250
<25-3,BECKETT>还知道你认识她母亲
<25-3,BECKETT>We know that you knew her mom.

834
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,950
<25-3,BECKETT>要不你开始说实话
<25-3,BECKETT>Either you start telling me the truth,

835
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,290
<25-3,BECKETT>要不等我给媒体漏点口风
<25-3,BECKETT>Or you're gonna spend the last few weeks

836
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,890
<25-3,BECKETT>你弟弟竞选的最后几周
<25-3,BECKETT>Of your brother's campaign issuing denials

837
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,680
<25-3,BECKETT>你就忙着拒绝各大媒体的采访吧
<25-3,BECKETT>After I release what I know to the press.

838
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,330
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>好  我认识她母亲
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Fine. I knew her mother.

839
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,030
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>她母亲去世后
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>After her mother passed, Olivia set about

840
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,150
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>奥利维亚打算解开身世之谜
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>To unravel the mystery of her origins.

841
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,870
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>奥利维亚很聪明
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Olivia was clever.

842
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,310
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>她根据手上的线索
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>She put together the clues,

843
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,600
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>发现她父亲是威尔士利家族的成员
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Found out her father was a Wellesley--

844
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,420
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>威尔士利成员
<25-4,WINSTON WELLESLEY>A Wellesley

845
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,150
<25-5,BECKETT>然后呢
<25-5,BECKETT>And?

846
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,840
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>其实我就是奥利维亚的父亲
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Actually, the truth is, I'm Olivia's father.

847
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,720
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我知道很不可思议  十年前
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I know. I had the same look on my face

848
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,280
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>她告诉我的时候  我的表情和你一样
<25-6,WINSTON WELLESLEY>When Olivia told me ten years ago.

849
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,490
<25-7,CASTLE>奥利维亚的母亲没有告诉你吗
<25-7,CASTLE>And Olivia's mother didn't tell you?

850
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,700
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>她也没有告诉奥利维亚
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Mnh-mnh. Didn't tell Olivia either.

851
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,420
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>在我即将告诉大家真相时
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I was just on the verge of telling everyone when she...

852
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,740
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>她却意外惨死了
<25-8,WINSTON WELLESLEY>When she was tragically killed.

853
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,340
<25-9,BECKETT>亲父弑女  真是个悲剧
<25-9,BECKETT>It is a tragedy when a father kills

854
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,520
<25-9,BECKETT>不是吗
<25-9,BECKETT>His daughter, isn't it?

855
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,310
<25-10,WINSTON WELLESLEY>什么
<25-10,WINSTON WELLESLEY>What?

856
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,600
<25-11,BECKETT>奥利维亚的尸体失踪跟你有什么关系
<25-11,BECKETT>What do you know about Olivia's missing body?

857
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,980
<25-12,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我不知道  太变态了
<25-12,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Nothing. That's obscene.

858
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,580
<25-12,WINSTON WELLESLEY>谁会做那种事
<25-12,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Who would do something like that?

859
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,950
<25-13,CASTLE>你  这样就没人知道
<25-13,CASTLE>You, so no one would ever find out the truth

860
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,840
<25-13,CASTLE>她的真实身份了
<25-13,CASTLE>Of who she really was.

861
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,520
<25-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我没杀她
<25-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>I didn't kill her,

862
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,780
<25-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我也没有把她的尸体藏起来
<25-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>And I certainly didn't hide her body.

863
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,720
<25-15,CASTLE>还有  她已经去世十年
<25-15,CASTLE>Yet, ten years after her death,

864
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,200
<25-15,CASTLE>你却还在隐瞒她的存在
<25-15,CASTLE>You're still trying to hide her existence.

865
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,030
<25-16,WINSTON WELLESLEY>你们得理解  我要保护我的家族
<25-16,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Well, you have to understand. I have a family to protect.

866
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,030
<25-17,CASTLE>奥利维亚就是你的家人
<25-17,CASTLE>Olivia was family.

867
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,080
<26-1,CASTLE>温斯顿·威尔士利  你就是凶手
<26-1,CASTLE>Winston Wellesley, you did it.

868
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,840
<26-2,BECKETT>可能是他  但我们没有证据
<26-2,BECKETT>He might have, but we don't have the evidence to prove it.

869
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,660
<26-3,ESPOSITO>因为不是他干的
<26-3,ESPOSITO>That's because he didn't.

870
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,260
<26-3,ESPOSITO>我们找到了温斯顿的不在场证明
<26-3,ESPOSITO>We were able to verify Winston's alibi.

871
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,440
<26-4,BECKETT>他真的独自在家吗
<26-4,BECKETT>He really was home alone?

872
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,800
<26-5,RYAN>他在家  但不是独自
<26-5,RYAN>Oh, he was home, but he wasn't alone.

873
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,870
<26-5,RYAN>温斯顿那晚有爱人相伴
<26-5,RYAN>Winston had some romantic company that night.

874
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,950
<26-6,BECKETT>如果他有不在场证明
<26-6,BECKETT>Well, then if he had an alibi,

875
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,310
<26-6,BECKETT>为什么一开始他不说呢
<26-6,BECKETT>Why didn't he just say so from the start?

876
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,220
<26-7,ESPOSITO>也许因为他的情人是
<26-7,ESPOSITO>Maybe because of who his romantic company was.

877
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,930
<26-8,RYAN>斯坦利·詹金斯
<26-8,RYAN>Stanley Jenkins.

878
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,350
<26-9,CASTLE>斯坦利现在是男女通用的名字了吗
<26-9,CASTLE>Is Stanley a unisex name now

879
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,230
<26-9,CASTLE>还是说温斯顿
<26-9,CASTLE>Or is Winston--

880
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,460
<26-10,RYAN>同性恋  没错  他是同性恋
<26-10,RYAN>Gay? Uh, yeah. He's gay.

881
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,650
<26-11,BECKETT>他对我们撒谎  他在保护谁
<26-11,BECKETT>He lied to us. Who is he protecting?

882
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,820
<26-12,CASTLE>他已经告诉我们了
<26-12,CASTLE>Well, he said it himself.

883
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,360
<26-12,CASTLE>家族
<26-12,CASTLE>Family.

884
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,850
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>你应该清楚这个年轻女子
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>You have to understand that this young woman--

885
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,440
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>奥利维亚  我不认识她
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Olivia-- I hardly knew her.

886
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,580
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>也许在派对上我和她握过手
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Maybe I shook her hand at the party,

887
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,340
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>但也仅此而已
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>But that's all.

888
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,440
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>现在你说她母亲三十年前和我
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>And now you're telling me her mother and I worked

889
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,350
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>同为竞选工作吗
<27-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>The same campaign 30 years ago?

890
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,060
<27-2,BECKETT>你和你哥哥78年7月和8月
<27-2,BECKETT>You and your brother were in Ithaca

891
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,350
<27-2,BECKETT>都在伊萨卡岛竞选总部
<27-2,BECKETT>July and August of '78.

892
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,350
<27-2,BECKETT>奥利维亚出生于79年5月
<27-2,BECKETT>Olivia was born May, '79.

893
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,620
<27-2,BECKETT>正是九个月之后
<27-2,BECKETT>That's 9 months later.

894
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,590
<27-3,CASTLE>你哥哥自己说是她父亲
<27-3,CASTLE>Your brother claimed paternity,

895
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:51,030
<27-3,CASTLE>但我们都知道那是不可能的
<27-3,CASTLE>But I think we all know that's highly unlikely.

896
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:53,910
<27-4,BLAKE WELLESLEY>温斯顿  这到底是怎么回事
<27-4,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Winston, what the hell is going on here?

897
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,960
<27-5,WINSTON WELLESLEY>布莱克  是时候请律师了
<27-5,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Blake, it's time to get the lawyers involved.

898
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,940
<27-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>这件事你知道什么  温斯顿
<27-6,BLAKE WELLESLEY>What did you know about this, Winston?

899
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,300
<27-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>此时此地不适合说话
<27-7,WINSTON WELLESLEY>This is not the time or the place.

900
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,050
<27-8,BLAKE WELLESLEY>那年夏天之后我再没见过埃德娜
<27-8,BLAKE WELLESLEY>I never saw Edna after that summer.

901
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,970
<27-8,BLAKE WELLESLEY>她从来没告诉过我
<27-8,BLAKE WELLESLEY>She never told me anything.

902
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,630
<27-9,BECKETT>那么你承认和她上过床吗
<27-9,BECKETT>So you admit to sleeping with her?

903
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,210
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>她一定是不想惹麻烦
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>She must have not wanted to rock the boat,

904
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,350
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>不想让我父亲深陷丑闻
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Hurt my father's campaign

905
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,150
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>影响我父亲的选举
<27-10,BLAKE WELLESLEY>With a scandal involving his son.

906
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,080
<27-11,WINSTON WELLESLEY>布莱克  你说的已经够多了
<27-11,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Blake, you've said enough.

907
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,650
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>我刚知道自己有个女儿
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>I just found out I had a daughter I never knew about,

908
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,710
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>一个十年前被谋杀
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>A daughter who was murdered

909
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,050
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>凶手却仍逍遥法外的女儿
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>And whose killer apparently is still at large.

910
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,100
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>你为什么跟警察说
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Why did you tell the police

911
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,860
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>自己是她父亲  为什么
<27-12,BLAKE WELLESLEY>You were her father? Why?

912
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,770
<27-13,CASTLE>事实上问题是
<27-13,CASTLE>Actually the question is

913
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,080
<27-13,CASTLE>他为何十年前这么告诉奥利维亚
<27-13,CASTLE>Why did he tell Olivia that ten years ago?

914
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,030
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>你必须理解  布莱克
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>You have to understand, Blake.

915
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,530
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>这事发生在第一次参议员选举期间
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>This was during the first senate run.

916
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,220
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>这样的丑闻会让选举失利
<27-14,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Scandal would've killed the campaign.

917
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,600
<27-15,BLAKE WELLESLEY>但最后我还是输掉了选举
<27-15,BLAKE WELLESLEY>I lost the damn election anyway.

918
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,090
<27-15,BLAKE WELLESLEY>你无权不让我知道就做决定
<27-15,BLAKE WELLESLEY>You had no right to make that decision without me.

919
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,220
<27-16,WINSTON WELLESLEY>我们只是为了你着想
<27-16,WINSTON WELLESLEY>We were only looking out for your best interests.

920
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,810
<27-17,BECKETT>我们  温斯顿  我们是指谁
<27-17,BECKETT>We? Winston, who is "we"?

921
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,120
<28-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>妈妈  你还记得奥利维亚
<28-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Mother, do you remember Olivia--

922
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,310
<28-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>奥利维亚·德比西吗
<28-1,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Olivia Debiasse?

923
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,490
<28-2,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我当然记得  我记得很清楚
<28-2,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Of course I do. I have my mind.

924
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,860
<28-3,BECKETT>威尔士利夫人  我们要
<28-3,BECKETT>Mrs. Wellesley, we need to a--

925
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,400
<28-3,BECKETT>你是谁
<28-3,BECKETT>Who are you?

926
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,740
<28-4,LENANNE WELLESLEY>布莱克  她可不是奥利维亚
<28-4,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Blake, that's not Olivia.

927
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,660
<28-5,BLAKE WELLESLEY>妈妈  她是个警探
<28-5,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Yes, mother. This is a police Detective,

<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>-正在调查  -好
<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>- Investigating-- - Oh, yes.

00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,820
<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我的戒指不见了
<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>My ring was stolen.

930
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,080
<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>它很贵的
<28-6,LENANNE WELLESLEY>It was very expensive.

931
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,230
<28-7,BECKETT>好  夫人  但处理这件事之前
<28-7,BECKETT>Yes, ma'am. Uh, but before we can deal with that,

932
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,700
<28-7,BECKETT>我们要问您几个
<28-7,BECKETT>We need to ask you a few questions

933
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,460
<28-7,BECKETT>关于奥利维亚·德比西的问题
<28-7,BECKETT>About Olivia Debiasse.

934
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,750
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>奥利维亚到我这里  说来找父亲
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Olivia came to me looking for a father,

935
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,930
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>所以我告诉她是温斯顿
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>So I gave her Winston.

936
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,640
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>有个孩子能让他变得有点男人味
<28-8,LENANNE WELLESLEY>A child would go a long way to butch up his image.

937
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,350
<28-9,BLAKE WELLESLEY>但她是我的女儿  妈妈
<28-9,BLAKE WELLESLEY>But she was my daughter, mother.

938
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,220
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>你太出众了
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>You were too special.

00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,030
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>你将会成为参议员
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>You're going to be a senator,

940
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,060
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>甚至可能当上总统
<28-10,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Maybe even president someday.

941
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,530
<28-11,CASTLE>威尔士利夫人  奥利维亚被谋杀那天
<28-11,CASTLE>Mrs. Wellesley, what happened to Olivia

942
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,900
<28-11,CASTLE>究竟发生了什么
<28-11,CASTLE>The night of her murder?

943
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,020
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>这么多问题都是关于...
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Ooh! So many questions about--

944
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,000
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我不关心这些问题
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>I don't care for questions.

945
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,620
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>奥利维亚也质问过我
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Olivia questioned me.

946
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,930
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>粗鲁的女孩
<28-12,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Ugh! The gall of that girl.

947
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,590
<28-13,FRANK DAVIS>威尔士利先生  你母亲有病
<28-13,FRANK DAVIS>Mr. Wellesley, your mother is ill.

948
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,690
<28-13,FRANK DAVIS>她不能承受压力
<28-13,FRANK DAVIS>She can't handle the stress--

949
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,110
<28-14,LENANNE WELLESLEY>闭嘴  弗兰克  我什么都不怕
<28-14,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Oh, shut it, Frank. I can handle anything.

950
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,220
<28-15,FRANK DAVIS>她焦虑的话会很危险
<28-15,FRANK DAVIS>It's dangerous for her to get this riled up.

951
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,520
<28-15,FRANK DAVIS>我到车上给她拿药
<28-15,FRANK DAVIS>I'm getting her medication from the car.

952
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,920
<28-16,LENANNE WELLESLEY>为了找回我丢的戒指  还要做什么吗
<28-16,LENANNE WELLESLEY>What does any of this have to do with my stolen ring?

953
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,670
<28-17,WINSTON WELLESLEY>妈妈  你当晚去奥利维亚的公寓了吗
<28-17,WINSTON WELLESLEY>Mother... Did you go to Olivia's apartment that night?

954
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,700
<28-18,LENANNE WELLESLEY>她跟我作对  一定要阻止她
<28-18,LENANNE WELLESLEY>She crossed me, had to be stopped.

955
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,600
<28-19,BLAKE WELLESLEY>你做了什么  妈妈
<28-19,BLAKE WELLESLEY>What did you do, mother?

956
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,770
<28-19,BLAKE WELLESLEY>威尔士利夫人
<28-19,BLAKE WELLESLEY>Mrs. Wellesley...

957
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,650
<28-20,BECKETT>是你杀死了奥利维亚·德比西吗
<28-20,BECKETT>Did you kill Olivia Debiasse?

958
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,450
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>杀死她  我为什么要杀死她
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>Kill her? Why would I kill her?

959
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,630
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>没有
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>N-no.

960
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,480
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>我说"处理好这件事"
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>I... Said "take care of it,"

961
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,040
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>接着事情就安排妥当了
<28-21,LENANNE WELLESLEY>And it was taken care of.

962
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,580
<28-22,BECKETT>你让谁去处理这件事
<28-22,BECKETT>And who did you ask to take care of it?

963
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,520
<29-1,MONTGOMERY>是弗兰克·戴维斯吗
<29-1,MONTGOMERY>Well, well, well, if it isn't Frank Davis.

964
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,690
<29-2,FRANK DAVIS>对不起  朋友  你认错人了
<29-2,FRANK DAVIS>Sorry, pal. Got the wrong guy.

965
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,150
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>我可不这么想
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>I don't think so, pal.

966
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,330
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>我花了些时间
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>I just spent the better part of a day

967
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,950
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>审问一个叫帕特森的看守
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>Sweating a guard named Patterson,

968
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,820
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>他在布莱迪·汤姆逊遇害的监狱工作
<29-3,MONTGOMERY>Who works at the prison where Brady Thompson was killed.

969
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,300
<29-4,FRANK DAVIS>我不认识什么布莱迪·汤姆逊
<29-4,FRANK DAVIS>I don't know any Brady Thompson

970
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,820
<29-4,FRANK DAVIS>也不认识帕特森
<29-4,FRANK DAVIS>And I don't know any Patterson.

971
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,610
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>有意思  因为他认识你
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>That's funny, 'cause he knows you.

972
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,690
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>他说你贿赂他监听
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>Said that you paid him to monitor

973
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,640
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>布莱迪·汤姆逊寄包裹的电话
<29-5,MONTGOMERY>Brady Thompson's calls about a package.

974
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,840
<29-6,ESPOSITO>不  别想跑
<29-6,ESPOSITO>No. No, no, no.

975
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,940
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>说你付钱  让他找个被判无期的囚犯
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>Said that you paid him to have a lifer

976
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,240
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>把刀插进布莱迪·汤姆逊后背
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>Put a shiv in Brady Thompson's back.

977
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,970
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>现在你说我有没有抓错人
<29-7,MONTGOMERY>Now you tell me how I got the wrong guy.

978
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,730
<29-8,MONTGOMERY>手铐
<29-8,MONTGOMERY>Cuffs.

979
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,040
<30-1,CASTLE>弗兰克是家族杀手吗
<30-1,CASTLE>So Frank was the family hit man?

980
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,340
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>更像是位家族帮手
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>More like the family fixer.

981
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,430
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>他为威尔士利重新当选参议员
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>He cleaned up all types of dirt

982
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,670
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>扫清障碍
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>For senator Wellesley back in the day.

983
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,010
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>他知道下葬尸体的地方
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>He knows where all the bodies are buried.

984
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,070
<30-3,CASTLE>也知道要挖出哪个
<30-3,CASTLE>And which ones needed to be dug up.

985
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,350
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>按威尔士利夫人的命令
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>And then after he got rid of Olivia

986
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:22,590
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>摆脱奥利维亚后
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>On Mrs. Wellesley's orders,

987
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,280
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>他联系所有生活潦倒的朋友
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>He called around to all his low-life connections

988
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,090
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>直到找到愿意解决问题的家伙
<30-4,MONTGOMERY>Until he found someone desperate enough to cut a deal.

989
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,620
<30-5,CASTLE>为什么十年后
<30-5,CASTLE>Then why, after ten years,

990
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,620
<30-5,CASTLE>不再为布莱迪蹲监狱付钱了
<30-5,CASTLE>Would he suddenly stop paying Brady to do his jail time?

991
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,260
<30-6,MONTGOMERY>威尔士利夫人生病后
<30-6,MONTGOMERY>When Mrs. Wellesley lost her faculties,

992
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,840
<30-6,MONTGOMERY>布莱克负责管理家族事物
<30-6,MONTGOMERY>Blake was granted power of attorney.

993
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,030
<30-7,BECKETT>弗兰克拿不到钱继续付款
<30-7,BECKETT>Frank couldn't get the money to make the payments anymore.

994
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,360
<30-8,CASTLE>所以他停止付款  打算让布莱迪消失
<30-8,CASTLE>So he stopped, figuring Brady would just disappear?

995
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,680
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>当他发现布莱迪有证据
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>And when he found out Brady had evidence

996
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,270
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>证明自己无辜的时候  弗兰克慌了
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>To prove his innocence, Frank panicked.

997
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,920
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>他偷了威尔士利夫人的戒指抵押
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>He stole Mrs. Wellesley's ring and hocked it

998
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,070
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>换钱来让布莱迪彻底闭嘴
<30-9,MONTGOMERY>To finance his plan to shut Brady up permanently.

999
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,830
<30-10,BECKETT>顺便说一下  看看分局完成的指标
<30-10,BECKETT>By the way, took a look at the precinct's numbers.

1000
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:48,460
<30-10,BECKETT>破获三起案子
<30-10,BECKETT>Three closed cases

1001
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,760
<30-10,BECKETT>让我们刚好达到要求的破案率
<30-10,BECKETT>Puts us just over the mandated case closure rate,

1002
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,130
<30-10,BECKETT>正赶上应付明天的检查
<30-10,BECKETT>Right in time for the review tomorrow.

1003
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,820
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>你知道比那更好的是什么吗
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>You know what's even better than that?

1004
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,510
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>十年后  我能打电话给奥利维亚的姑姑
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>After ten years, I can call Olivia's aunt

1005
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,220
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>告诉她终于抓到了真凶
<30-11,MONTGOMERY>And tell her that we really got the guy, finally.

1006
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,760
<30-12,CASTLE>你也去告诉快递员的姐姐结果
<30-12,CASTLE>And you get to give the messenger's sister some closure, too.

1007
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,660
<30-14,CASTLE>虽然我不知道  怎么说才能宽慰死者家属
<30-14,CASTLE>Though I don't suppose having answers makes it any easier.

1008
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,930
<30-15,BECKETT>有办法  及时说就好
<30-15,BECKETT>It does... In time.

1009
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,740
<31-1,ALEXIS>难以置信
<31-1,ALEXIS>I can't believe

1010
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,060
<31-1,ALEXIS>为了满足一个女人保护家族名誉的需要
<31-1,ALEXIS>How many lives were ruined over one woman's need

1011
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,690
<31-1,ALEXIS>毁了多少生命
<31-1,ALEXIS>To protect her family's reputation.

1012
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,550
<31-2,CASTLE>你永远不会有这种烦恼的
<31-2,CASTLE>You will never have this problem.

1013
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,650
<31-2,CASTLE>因为有你我和你奶奶
<31-2,CASTLE>Between grams and myself,

1014
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,720
<31-2,CASTLE>我们的家族名誉已经毁了
<31-2,CASTLE>Our family reputation's already in ruins.

1015
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
<31-3,ALEXIS>我真幸运
<31-3,ALEXIS>Mm, lucky me.

1016
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,450
<31-5,ALEXIS>布莱迪的儿子会怎么样呢
<31-5,ALEXIS>What's gonna happen to Brady's son?

1017
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,220
<31-6,CASTLE>乌云过后  阳光灿烂
<31-6,CASTLE>Well, there's a silver lining there.

1018
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,590
<31-6,CASTLE>当布莱克·威尔士利知道
<31-6,CASTLE>When Blake Wellesley found out

1019
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,060
<31-6,CASTLE>布莱迪为什么出卖自由
<31-6,CASTLE>Why Brady sold his freedom...

1020
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,760
<31-8,CASTLE>他承诺向纽约儿童慈善团体捐款两千万
<31-8,CASTLE>He pledged $20 million to a local kids' charity..

1021
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,510
<31-8,CASTLE>他们同意照顾布莱迪的儿子
<31-8,CASTLE>Who agreed to handle Brady's son's care.

1022
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,240
<31-9,ALEXIS>太好了
<31-9,ALEXIS>Oh, that's so sweet.

1023
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,570
<31-11,ALEXIS>看起来真不错  奶奶  热辣约会吗
<31-11,ALEXIS>Lookin' good, Grams. Hot date?

1024
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,760
<31-12,MARTHA>和查特·帕拉本共进晚餐并还要共舞几曲
