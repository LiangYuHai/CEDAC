00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,770
<6-5,JOHN KNOX>-我可没杀那人  -真的吗
<6-5,JOHN KNOX>- I didn't kill the guy. - Really?

124
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,829
<6-6,BECKETT>你的记录上可清清楚楚写着了
<6-6,BECKETT>Because it says here that you have quite a history

125
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,058
<6-6,BECKETT>好几次试图谋杀  过去两年三次谋杀未遂
<6-6,BECKETT>Of trying to kill people-- three in the last two years,

126
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:01,318
<6-6,BECKETT>没准我还少算了
<6-6,BECKETT>Or am I missing any?

127
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,471
<6-7,JOHN KNOX>我可从没被定过罪
<6-7,JOHN KNOX>I was never convicted of anything.

128
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,416
<6-8,BECKETT>这可不算是否认
<6-8,BECKETT>That's not exactly a denial.

129
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,228
<6-9,CASTLE>你常锻炼吗
<6-9,CASTLE>Do you work out?

130
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:09,733
<6-9,CASTLE>仰卧推举  硬举之类的
<6-9,CASTLE>You know, bench press, dead lift?

131
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,522
<6-9,CASTLE>要把个人从屋顶扔下
<6-9,CASTLE>It must take a lot of upper body strength

132
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:12,900
<6-9,CASTLE>对上肢力量要求可不低
<6-9,CASTLE>To throw a guy off a roof.

133
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:14,986
<6-10,JOHN KNOX>这人是谁
<6-10,JOHN KNOX>Who is this guy?

134
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,667
<6-11,BECKETT>你跟巴克利为何争执
<6-11,BECKETT>What did you and Buckley fight about?

135
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:19,393
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>那是因为他想控告我人身攻击
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>Look, he had it out for me because he put me on trial

136
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:22,774
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>把我送进监狱  我从未做过  他也确实败诉了
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>For an assault I didn't commit and he lost.

137
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:24,062
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>他不能像条汉子那么勇敢接受
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>And rather than being a man about it,

138
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,889
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>反而觉得吓唬我
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>He decided to rattle my cage,

139
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,672
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>能证明他是个真正的男子汉
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>To show me who was the alpha male.

140
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,911
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>真是有够烦人  还很幼稚
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>So, yeah, it was annoying and childish,

141
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,755
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>绝不至于杀人  何况他还是检察官
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>But not something you kill a guy over, especially a D.A.

142
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:38,591
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>我或许是犯了事  但我可不蠢
<6-12,JOHN KNOX>Now I may be a criminal,  but I'm not...stupid.

143
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,482
<6-13,BECKETT>巴克利凶案发生时  你有不在场证明吗
<6-13,BECKETT>Do you have an alibi for Buckley's murder?

144
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,429
<6-14,JOHN KNOX>我不知道  他什么时候被害的
<6-14,JOHN KNOX>I don't know. What time was he killed?

145
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:46,431
<6-15,BECKETT>-晚上九点半  -在瘾君子匿名互诫会
<6-15,BECKETT>- 9:30 p.m. - I was at an A.A. meeting.

146
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,170
<6-17,BECKETT>匿名的  真有意思
<6-17,BECKETT>Anonymous? That's cute.

147
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,447
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>你们不相信我
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>You don't believe me?

148
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,019
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>也许你们会信我的担保人
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>Well, then maybe you'll believe my sponsor...

149
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,897
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>丹尼尔·米勒牧师
<6-18,JOHN KNOX>Reverend Daniel Miller.

150
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,759
<6-19,CASTLE>你刚说牧师
<6-19,CASTLE>Did you say "reverend"?

151
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,180
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>诺克斯那边查得如何
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>So where are we with Knox?

152
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,779
<7-2,RYAN>不在场证明没疑点
<7-2,RYAN>The alibi looks solid.

153
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,755
<7-2,RYAN>卡塞尔和贝克特
<7-2,RYAN>Castle and Beckett are interviewing

154
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:09,185
<7-2,RYAN>-正找那牧师谈话呢  -法医那边如何
<7-2,RYAN>- The good reverend right now. - What about forensics?

155
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:11,930
<7-3,MONTGOMERY>没进展  不过我有所发现
<7-3,MONTGOMERY>Looks like a bust, but I did  find something interesting.

156
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,517
<7-4,RYAN>查了巴克利的地铁卡刷卡记录
<7-4,RYAN>When checked into Buckley's metro card history.

157
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:17,080
<7-4,RYAN>整个月他每天只刷两次卡
<7-4,RYAN>His card only made two swipes a day for the whole month--

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,130
<7-4,RYAN>早上六点在他公寓附近地铁站刷卡
<7-4,RYAN>6:00 a.m. At the subway by his apartment,

159
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,539
<7-4,RYAN>晚上八点在他办公室这
<7-4,RYAN>8:00 p.m. By his office.

160
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,101
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>巴克利的生活只剩工作  尤其是离婚之后
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>Buckley lived for the job, especially after the divorce.

161
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,660
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>也许是想借工作来逃避烦恼吧
<7-5,MONTGOMERY>Probably trying to lose himself in the work.

162
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,748
<7-6,RYAN>他被害那天  行为异常
<7-6,RYAN>On the day he was killed, Buckley did something unusual.

163
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:29,397
<7-6,RYAN>他去了西区77大街
<7-6,RYAN>He made an extra trip up to west 77th street

164
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:30,156
<7-6,RYAN>然后才去上班
<7-6,RYAN>Before he went to work.

165
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,694
<7-6,RYAN>他秘书不知道原因
<7-6,RYAN>His secretary has no idea why.

166
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,583
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>看看我们能否有发现
<7-7,MONTGOMERY>See if you can find out.

167
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:36,016
<7-8,ESPOSITO>队长  看来有人在跟踪巴克利
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Yo, cap. Looks like somebody was following our boy Buckley.

168
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,633
<7-8,ESPOSITO>他公寓的门卫说  有这么个人
<7-8,ESPOSITO>The doorman in his apartment said that a guy

169
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,445
<7-8,ESPOSITO>两天前过来想找巴克利谈谈
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Came in there two days ago demanding to talk to Buckley,

170
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:41,607
<7-8,ESPOSITO>不接受拒绝  一定要见
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Wouldn't take no for an answer.

171
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,540
<7-8,ESPOSITO>门卫几乎是把他丢出去的
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Doorman practically had to throw the guy out.

172
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,623
<7-8,ESPOSITO>就在巴克利被害当天早上
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Then on the morning of Buckley's murder,

173
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,903
<7-8,ESPOSITO>门卫发誓说  又见到了那家伙
<7-8,ESPOSITO>The doorman swears that he saw the same guy

174
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,017
<7-8,ESPOSITO>在那幢大楼外出现
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Hanging around outside the building.

175
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:52,308
<7-8,ESPOSITO>我从安保录像中截取了张照片
<7-8,ESPOSITO>I snagged a photo off the video surveillance.

176
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,660
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>先从罪犯照片里开始查
<7-9,MONTGOMERY>Start looking through  some mug shot books.

177
00:06:58,706 --> 00:06:59,830
<7-10,BECKETT>谢谢您  牧师
<7-10,BECKETT>Thank you, reverend.

178
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,411
<7-11,CASTLE>-很高兴见到您  -谢谢
<7-11,CASTLE>- Pleasure meeting you. - Thanks.

179
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:03,799
<7-12,BECKETT>是关于案子的
<7-12,BECKETT>Is this for our case?

180
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,794
<7-13,ESPOSITO>是  这人试图闯入巴克利的公寓
<7-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the guy who tried to hassle Buckley at his building.

181
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,631
<7-14,CASTLE>等等  我认识这人
<7-14,CASTLE>Wait a second. I know this guy.

182
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,005
<7-14,CASTLE>没错  在我的“海角惊魂”名单里
<7-14,CASTLE>Yes. My "Cape Fear" file.

183
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:16,368
<7-15,CASTLE>就在这里  就在...这里
<7-15,CASTLE>Right here. Right... Here.

184
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:19,654
<7-15,CASTLE>他叫诺曼·杰赛普
<7-15,CASTLE>His name is Norman Jessup.

185
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,226
<7-15,CASTLE>四年前  巴克利负责
<7-15,CASTLE>Buckley got him four years ago

186
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,267
<7-15,CASTLE>他的银行劫案  有保安中枪
<7-15,CASTLE>On a bank robbery where a guard got shot.

187
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,555
<7-15,CASTLE>看到没  我说过我的档案能破这案子
<7-15,CASTLE>See? I told you this file would solve this case.

188
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:28,430
<7-16,ESPOSITO>记录上说他两周前出狱了
<7-16,ESPOSITO>It says here he got out two weeks ago

189
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,813
<7-16,ESPOSITO>法院受理了他的上诉
<7-16,ESPOSITO>When his conviction was overturned

190
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,927
<7-16,ESPOSITO>并且为他翻案了
<7-16,ESPOSITO>By the appellate court on a technicality.

191
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,444
<7-17,BECKETT>听上去杰赛普只该庆祝
<7-17,BECKETT>That sounds like a reason for Jessup

192
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:35,338
<7-17,BECKETT>而不是去杀了巴克利
<7-17,BECKETT>To celebrate not to kill Buckley.

193
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:39,227
<7-18,ESPOSITO>除非巴克利已经准备好再次上诉
<7-18,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except Buckley already filed an intent to retry.

194
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:42,431
<7-18,ESPOSITO>他胜诉的话  杰赛普将再次入狱两年
<7-18,ESPOSITO>Jessup was looking at another two years in jail if Buckley won.

195
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:44,489
<7-19,RYAN>这倒可能会让杰赛普抓狂
<7-19,RYAN>Well, that might have  made Jessup a little mad.

196
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:45,452
<7-20,CASTLE>没错  然后就是
<7-20,CASTLE>Right, and then it's all...

197
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:48,421
<7-20,CASTLE>你给我出来  出来  不管你躲在哪
<7-20,CASTLE>"Come out, come out wherever you are."

198
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:50,843
<7-21,RYAN>就这样  你心目中的狄尼洛[出演教父二]
<7-21,RYAN>Really? That's your De Niro?

199
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:53,151
<7-22,BECKETT>查查他现在的住址  列份相关人员清单
<7-22,BECKETT>Get a current address and a list of known associates.

200
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:55,102
<7-22,BECKETT>我想看看杰赛普怎么说
<7-22,BECKETT>I'd like to hear what Jessup has to say.

201
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,308
<8-1,JESSUP>等等  你全搞错了
<8-1,JESSUP>Wait. Wait. You got it all wrong.

202
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:02,203
<8-2,BECKETT>得了  警察  散开
<8-2,BECKETT>Hey! Come on! Police! Break it up!

203
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,427
<8-5,CASTLE>你不打算做点什么
<8-5,CASTLE>Are you gonna do something?

204
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,366
<8-6,BECKETT>在酒吧劝架  肯定会遭殃
<8-6,BECKETT>Breaking up a bar fight is a sure way to get hit.

205
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:09,081
<8-6,BECKETT>别担心  马上就好
<8-6,BECKETT>Don't worry. It'll be over in a minute.

206
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,819
<8-7,CASTLE>我也在酒吧打过架
<8-7,CASTLE>You know, I was in a bar fight once.

207
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,581
<8-8,BECKETT>真的  谁赢了
<8-8,BECKETT>Really? Who won?

208
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:14,756
<8-9,BECKETT>让我猜猜
<8-9,BECKETT>Ow! Ah! Oh, let me guess.

209
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:16,980
<8-10,BECKETT>肯定不是你
<8-10,BECKETT>Not you.

210
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,394
<8-11,BECKETT>杰赛普先生  想找茬吗
<8-11,BECKETT>You want to fight, Mr. Jessup?

211
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:22,536
<8-11,BECKETT>先想办法搞定你的谋杀指控吧
<8-11,BECKETT>You can fight a murder charge.

213
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:31,302
<9-1,JESSUP>抱歉  伙计
<9-1,JESSUP>Yo, I'm sorry, man.

214
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,261
<9-1,JESSUP>我不是有意
<9-1,JESSUP>I didn't mean to embarrass you

215
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,494
<9-1,JESSUP>让你在女友面前难堪的
<9-1,JESSUP>In front of your girlfriend there.

216
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:36,283
<9-2,BECKETT>我可不是他女友  我是凶案组的探长
<9-2,BECKETT>I am not his girlfriend. I am a homicide detective.

217
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,975
<9-2,BECKETT>还有  你该更把这当回事
<9-2,BECKETT>And you should be taking this a little bit more seriously.

218
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:41,620
<9-3,JESSUP>酒吧的那人  是他挑起的  好吗
<9-3,JESSUP>Hey, that guy in that bar, he started this whole thing, okay?

219
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,715
<9-3,JESSUP>他以为我是在勾搭他女友
<9-3,JESSUP>He thought I was hitting on his girlfriend,

220
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,527
<9-3,JESSUP>我可没有勾搭他女友
<9-3,JESSUP>And I was not hitting on his girlfriend.

221
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:45,838
<9-3,JESSUP>真是个天大的误会
<9-3,JESSUP>It was just a big misunderstanding.

222
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,830
<9-4,BECKETT>对  就像那起银行劫案一样
<9-4,BECKETT>Right. Just like the bank robbery.

223
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:50,248
<9-5,JESSUP>正是  我根本不知道
<9-5,JESSUP>Exactly. I had no idea my buddies

224
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,340
<9-5,JESSUP>我朋友打算抢劫那银行  一点都不知道
<9-5,JESSUP>Were gonna rob that bank--  no idea at all.

225
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,234
<9-5,JESSUP>他们说自己车坏了  要我载他们一程
<9-5,JESSUP>They said their car broke down and they needed a ride.

226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,245
<9-5,JESSUP>我就让他们搭车了
<9-5,JESSUP>And I gave them a ride.

227
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,190
<9-6,CASTLE>这种说话没让巴克利采信
<9-6,CASTLE>And that argument didn't sway Buckley?

228
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,344
<9-7,JESSUP>你能信吗
<9-7,JESSUP>Can you believe it?

229
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,482
<9-7,JESSUP>他告诉我的律师  那个保安中枪了
<9-7,JESSUP>He told my lawyer that the guard got shot,

230
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:02,747
<9-7,JESSUP>因此  在法律上
<9-7,JESSUP>And therefore, in the eyes of the law,

231
00:09:02,747 --> 00:09:05,415
<9-7,JESSUP>我跟枪杀他的那人  一样负有责任
<9-7,JESSUP>I was just as responsible as the guy who shot him.

232
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,127
<9-7,JESSUP>那肯定让你十分恼火
<9-7,JESSUP>That must have made you angry.

233
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:08,657
<9-8,BECKETT>你怎么看巴克利
<9-8,BECKETT>How'd you feel about the fact that Buckley

234
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,319
<9-8,BECKETT>打算上诉你的案子  并让你服完
<9-8,BECKETT>Was gonna retry your case and try to make you serve

235
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,682
<9-8,BECKETT>最后两年刑
<9-8,BECKETT>The final two years of your sentence?

236
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:14,336
<9-9,JESSUP>说真的吗  探长  我会哭得像个婴儿
<9-9,JESSUP>Honestly, lady? I cried like a baby.

237
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,194
<9-10,BECKETT>蹲监狱不好受  我不想回去
<9-10,BECKETT>Prison is not fun, okay? I did not want to go back.

238
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:19,680
<9-11,JESSUP>我想如果能和巴克利先生谈谈
<9-11,JESSUP>I figured if I could just talk to Mr. Buckley,

239
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,843
<9-11,JESSUP>就可以告诉他我从哪儿来的
<9-11,JESSUP>I could let him know where I'm coming from.

240
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:23,911
<9-12,BECKETT>所以你去了巴克利的公寓
<9-12,BECKETT>Which is what you were doing at Buckley's building.

241
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,285
<9-13,JESSUP>慢着慢着  我是跟着他几天了
<9-13,JESSUP>Whoa. Whoa. I followed the man around for a few days, okay?

242
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,271
<9-13,JESSUP>只为等自己有勇气去和他谈
<9-13,JESSUP>Just so I could get my courage up to talk to him.

243
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:31,275
<9-14,BECKETT>你跟踪巴克利
<9-14,BECKETT>You were stalking Buckley?

244
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:33,432
<9-15,JESSUP>跟踪是一个非常难听的词
<9-15,JESSUP>Stalking is a pretty damn ugly word.

245
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:34,643
<9-15,JESSUP>不要说是跟踪  好吗
<9-15,JESSUP>Let's not use stalking, okay?

246
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:35,939
<9-15,JESSUP>我只是想弄清他的底细
<9-15,JESSUP>I was just trying to feel the guy out.

247
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,941
<9-15,JESSUP>明白我的意思吗  试着说服他
<9-15,JESSUP>You know what I mean? Trying to convince him, you know?

248
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:38,874
<9-15,JESSUP>以防你们没注意到
<9-15,JESSUP>In case you guys haven't noticed,

249
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,845
<9-15,JESSUP>我是个比较擅长运用文字的人
<9-15,JESSUP>I'm somewhat of a wordsmith, you know?

250
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:44,593
<9-15,JESSUP>一个真正的大师  精通于
<9-15,JESSUP>A real master of, you know, of, uh...

251
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:45,427
<9-16,CASTLE>文字
<9-16,CASTLE>Words?

252
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:48,612
<9-17,BECKETT>昨晚九点到十点你在哪里
<9-17,BECKETT>Where were you between 9:00  and 10:00 last night?

253
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,979
<9-18,JESSUP>就坐在你们刚抓我的酒吧
<9-18,JESSUP>I was sitting in the bar you guys just dragged me out of.

254
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:53,303
<9-19,BECKETT>好了  我们会进一步调查你得证词
<9-19,BECKETT>Okay. Well, we're gonna check into your alibi.

255
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,052
<9-19,BECKETT>在这期间  你会继续被监禁
<9-19,BECKETT>In the meantime, you're going back into holding

256
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,604
<9-19,BECKETT>直到我们有空处理打架的事
<9-19,BECKETT>Until we can process you for assault.

257
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:59,393
<9-20,JESSUP>怎么这样  我说了我很抱歉
<9-20,JESSUP>Oh, oh, come on! I said I was sorry.

258
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,150
<9-21,CASTLE>等等  巴克利的神秘之旅
<9-21,CASTLE>Wait. Buckley's mystery trip.

259
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,192
<9-21,CASTLE>昨天早上  你跟着巴克利去住宅区了吗
<9-21,CASTLE>Were you following Buckley uptown yesterday morning?

260
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:05,440
<9-22,JESSUP>是的  我跟着他
<9-22,JESSUP>Yeah, yeah, I was.

261
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,829
<9-23,BECKETT>-他去哪儿了  -他在某栋豪华大楼外
<9-23,BECKETT>- Where did he go? - He met some Asian dude

262
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:10,337
<9-24,JESSUP>见了一个亚洲人
<9-24,JESSUP>Outside this real fancy apartment building.

263
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,214
<9-24,JESSUP>然后他们就吵起来了
<9-24,JESSUP>Then they started to argue with each other

264
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,927
<9-24,JESSUP>你们认为可能是那个人杀了他
<9-24,JESSUP>You think maybe that's the guy who killed him?

265
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,843
<9-25,CASTLE>如果再看到那栋楼  能认出来吗
<9-25,CASTLE>Would you recognize the building if you saw it again?

266
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:19,973
<9-26,JESSUP>当然  那边我很熟
<9-26,JESSUP>Oh, yeah. I get around.

267
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,449
<9-27,CASTLE>去一趟吧
<9-27,CASTLE>Road trip.

268
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,941
<10-1,JESSUP>你们介意我把这玩意取下来吗
<10-1,JESSUP>Hey, you guys mind if I take these things off?

269
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,517
<10-1,JESSUP>我感觉很老套
<10-1,JESSUP>I'm starting to feel like a stereotype

270
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,262
<10-1,JESSUP>坐在警车后面兜风  还戴着这玩意儿
<10-1,JESSUP>Riding around in the back of a police car wearing 'em.

271
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,748
<10-2,BECKETT>可以  需要钥匙吗
<10-2,BECKETT>Sure. Do you want my key?

272
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,323
<10-3,JESSUP>免了  我会弄  谢谢
<10-3,JESSUP>No. I got it. Thanks.

273
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,155
<10-4,CASTLE>你怎么弄开的
<10-4,CASTLE>How did you do that?

274
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,084
<10-5,JESSUP>我很会开锁
<10-5,JESSUP>I've always been good with locks.

275
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,561
<10-5,JESSUP>当我还在牢里的时候  我就想
<10-5,JESSUP>When I was in the joint, I was thinking,

276
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:50,461
<10-5,JESSUP>我怎样才能利用这个  并从中获利呢
<10-5,JESSUP>How can I take this and make it more productive, you know?

277
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,497
<10-5,JESSUP>所以我就申请了锁匠学校
<10-5,JESSUP>So I been applying to locksmith schools.

278
00:10:52,497 --> 00:10:53,584
<10-5,JESSUP>但  你知道  他们不接收我
<10-5,JESSUP>But, you know, they won't let me in

279
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,287
<10-5,JESSUP>就因为我是犯人  能相信吗
<10-5,JESSUP>On account that I'm a felon. Can you believe that?

280
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:57,920
<10-6,BECKETT>一个犯人想当锁匠
<10-6,BECKETT>A felon who wants to be a locksmith.

281
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,673
<10-6,BECKETT>没法不令人怀疑
<10-6,BECKETT>What could possibly go wrong there?

282
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,218
<10-7,JESSUP>可以别想得这么卑鄙吗
<10-7,JESSUP>You don't have to be mean about it.

283
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,303
<11-1,JESSUP>如果想当锁匠的话  就听好了
<11-1,JESSUP>If you're gonna be a locksmith, you gotta listen.

284
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,229
<11-1,JESSUP>左手到右边  右手在上面
<11-1,JESSUP>Left to right, right over left.

285
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,674
<11-2,CASTLE>我觉得我越弄越紧了
<11-2,CASTLE>I think I made it tighter.

286
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:16,083
<11-3,BECKETT>杰赛普  看到那楼了吗
<11-3,BECKETT>Jessup, do you see the building?

<11-10,BECKETT>I don't know. It's probably no big deal.

298
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,621
<11-11,CASTLE>当你对你父亲隐瞒小秘密的时候
<11-11,CASTLE>When you kept secrets from your father,

299
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,116
<11-11,CASTLE>那不是什么大事吗
<11-11,CASTLE>Was it not a big deal?

300
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,341
<11-12,BECKETT>知道吗  我不会问的
<11-12,BECKETT>You know, I'm not even gonna ask.

301
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,944
<11-13,JESSUP>就是右手边的那楼
<11-13,JESSUP>That's the building on the right-hand side.

302

<12-1,BECKETT>Apartment 801? Okay. Thanks.

306
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:03,939
<12-2,BECKETT>原来
<12-2,BECKETT>So it turns out

307
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:06,780
<12-2,BECKETT>这栋楼里唯一的亚裔房客是保罗·周
<12-2,BECKETT>That the building's only Asian tenant is Paul Chou,

308
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,649
<12-2,BECKETT>而他正是巴克利前妻的哥哥
<12-2,BECKETT>Who just happens to be Buckley's ex-brother-in-law.

309
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,258
<12-3,CASTLE>那可能不是《海角惊魂》了
<12-3,CASTLE>Oh, well, maybe it's not "Cape Fear" then.

310
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:13,515
<12-3,CASTLE>而可能是《家仇》
<12-3,CASTLE>Maybe it's "Family Feud."

311
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:15,024
<12-3,CASTLE>可能离婚让巴克利很同甘苦
<12-3,CASTLE>Maybe Buckley's bitter divorce

312
00:12:15,024 --> 00:12:18,059
<12-3,CASTLE>带来了很多不愉快  从而引起了打斗
<12-3,CASTLE>Caused enough hard feelings that things turned violent?

313
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,848
<12-3,CASTLE>我不明白  我已经几个月没见杰克了
<12-3,CASTLE>I don't understand. I haven't seen Jack in months

314
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,045
<13-1,PAUL CHO>自从他和我妹妹离婚之后就没见过了
<13-1,PAUL CHO>Not since he divorced my sister.

315
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,448
<13-1,PAUL CHO>是吗
<13-1,PAUL CHO>Really?

316
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,840
<13-2,BECKETT>可惜我有目击证人
<13-2,BECKETT>Because I have an eyewitness

317
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,967
<13-2,BECKETT>昨天早上他看到你们争吵
<13-2,BECKETT>Who saw the two of you arguing yesterday morning.

318
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,542
<13-2,BECKETT>那也就意味着你对我说谎
<13-2,BECKETT>So that means you're lying to me.

319
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,184
<13-3,CASTLE>她讨厌别人说谎
<13-3,CASTLE>She hates being lied to.

320
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:40,056
<13-4,PAUL CHO>我不知道你在说什么
<13-4,PAUL CHO>I don't know what you're talking about.

321
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,688
<13-5,BECKETT>那好  我们到警察局去
<13-5,BECKETT>Great. Let's go down to the precinct.

322
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:42,693
<13-5,BECKETT>我会安排你戴手铐走一趟
<13-5,BECKETT>I'll arrange a perp walk,

323
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,847
<13-5,BECKETT>你可以尽情表演给那些记者们看
<13-5,BECKETT>And you can put on a show for the cameras.

324
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,671
<13-6,CASTLE>享受你的嫌犯之旅
<13-6,CASTLE>Love a good perp walk.

325
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,530
<13-7,PAUL CHO>等等  等等
<13-7,PAUL CHO>Wait, wait, wait, wait.

326
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,168
<13-8,PAUL CHO>前天晚上
<13-8,PAUL CHO>The night before last,

327
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,878
<13-8,PAUL CHO>我被个戴滑雪面具的人袭击了
<13-8,PAUL CHO>I was attacked by a man in a ski mask.

328
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,193
<13-8,PAUL CHO>他警告我  让我叫巴克利远离丹东
<13-8,PAUL CHO>He warned me to tell Buckley to back off Danton

329
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:02,043
<13-8,PAUL CHO>-否则他就毁了我  -谁是丹东
<13-8,PAUL CHO>- Or he would ruin me. - Who's Danton?

330
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,229
<13-10,PAUL CHO>我不知道  但杰克肯定知道
<13-10,PAUL CHO>I don't know, but Jack definitely knew him.

331
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,950
<13-10,PAUL CHO>他说他不会轻易放过自己的
<13-10,PAUL CHO>He said he wasn't gonna let him get away with this.

332
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,311
<13-10,PAUL CHO>那就是我们吵架的原因
<13-10,PAUL CHO>That's why we were fighting.

333
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:11,383
<13-10,PAUL CHO>我告诉杰克至少听一次劝
<13-10,PAUL CHO>I told Jack to listen for once in his life.

334
00:13:11,702 --> 00:13:14,021
<13-10,PAUL CHO>-他得保护我  -为什么
<13-10,PAUL CHO>- He had to protect me.  - From what?

335
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:17,492
<13-12,PAUL CHO>-那不关你的事  -但嫌犯之旅是
<13-12,PAUL CHO>- That's none of your business. - Perp walk it is.

336
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,814
<13-13,BECKETT>好吧  好吧
<13-13,BECKETT>All right, all right.

337
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,791
<13-13,BECKETT>我有
<13-13,BECKETT>I have a...

338
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,141
<13-14,PAUL CHO>对女孩
<13-14,PAUL CHO>Slight fondness...

339
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,504
<13-14,PAUL CHO>略微有些偏爱
<13-14,PAUL CHO>For girls.

340
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:31,643
<13-15,CASTLE>年轻女孩
<13-15,CASTLE>Young girls?

341
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,710
<13-15,CASTLE>胖女孩
<13-15,CASTLE>Fat girls?

342
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,619
<13-15,CASTLE>学生妹
<13-15,CASTLE>Schoolgirls?

343
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:42,663
<13-16,PAUL CHO>应召女郎
<13-16,PAUL CHO>Call girls.

344
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,315
<13-17,BECKETT>还有别人知道你这爱好吗
<13-17,BECKETT>Oh. Who else knows about this fondness?

345
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,364
<13-18,PAUL CHO>只有那些女孩们
<13-18,PAUL CHO>Just the girls.

346
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:51,419
<13-19,CASTLE>事实上  女孩们  还有拉皮条的
<13-19,CASTLE>Actually, the girls...and their pimp.

347
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,376
<13-20,BECKETT>可能就是那个叫丹东的
<13-20,BECKETT>Whose name is probably Danton.

348
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,001
<13-21,PAUL CHO>好吧  没错  但我没有撒谎
<13-21,PAUL CHO>O-okay, fine. But I wasn't really lying.

349
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,322
<13-21,PAUL CHO>我从没见过丹东
<13-21,PAUL CHO>I-I've actually never met Danton.

350
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:02,493
<13-21,PAUL CHO>我从一个朋友那里拿到的电话
<13-21,PAUL CHO>Uh, I got the phone number for the agency from a friend.

351
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:05,714
<13-21,PAUL CHO>我打了电话  他们派个女孩来
<13-21,PAUL CHO>I call it, and then send over a girl.

352
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:10,922
<13-22,CASTLE>那么巴克利在调查丹东的应召生意
<13-22,CASTLE>So Buckley is investigating Danton's call girl ring.

353
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,109
<13-22,CASTLE>当丹东发现
<13-22,CASTLE>When Danton discovers

354
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,408
<13-22,CASTLE>巴克利的大舅子是个客户
<13-22,CASTLE>That Buckley's brother-in-law is a client,

355
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:16,370
<13-22,CASTLE>他发出警告  别管闲事否则伤害他家人
<13-22,CASTLE>He sends a message--back off or your family gets hurt.

356
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,903
<13-23,BECKETT>然后巴克利没有退步  丹东就杀了他
<13-23,BECKETT>And then when Buckley doesn't back down, Danton kills him.

357
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,963
<13-24,CASTLE>那我们怎样找到丹东呢
<13-24,CASTLE>So how do we find Danton?

358
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,502
<13-25,BECKETT>找个应召女郎来问问
<13-25,BECKETT>We talk to one of the call girls.

359
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:30,515
<13-26,BECKETT>打那个电话  让他们派个女孩来
<13-26,BECKETT>Call that number and tell him to bring one of his girls over.

360
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,833
<13-27,CASTLE>告诉她穿性感一点
<13-27,CASTLE>And tell her to wear something sexy.

361
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:36,311
<13-27,CASTLE>我们理所当然该享受这次询问的
<13-27,CASTLE>No reason we can't enjoy this interview.

362
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:44,550
<13-28,SCARLETT PRICE>保罗  等不及要见我了
<13-28,SCARLETT PRICE>Hey, Paul. Couldn't wait to see me, huh?

363
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,115
<13-29,BECKETT>事实上  是我要见你
<13-29,BECKETT>Actually, I'm the one who asked for the date.

364
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,121
<13-30,CASTLE>这不是巴克利办公室的女孩吗
<13-30,CASTLE>Isn't that the girl from Buckley's office?

365
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,535
<13-30,CASTLE>她之前看起来是这样吗
<13-30,CASTLE>Did she look like that before?

366
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,661
<14-1,CASTLE>一个应召女郎怎么又
<14-1,CASTLE>So how exactly does a call girl

367
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:09,102
<14-1,CASTLE>为超级检察官杰克·巴克利工作
<14-1,CASTLE>End up working for Jack Buckley, super D.A.?

368
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:10,705
<14-2,SCARLETT PRICE>我被逮捕了吗
<14-2,SCARLETT PRICE>Am I under arrest?

369
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,163
<14-3,BECKETT>如果你不好好回答问题的话  就逮捕你
<14-3,BECKETT>You will be if you don't answer the question.

370
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,683
<14-4,SCARLETT PRICE>杰克曾是我的客人
<14-4,SCARLETT PRICE>Jack was a client.

371
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,411
<14-5,BECKETT>抱歉  斯嘉丽  我不相信这一点
<14-5,BECKETT>I-I'm sorry, Scarlett. I don't believe that.

372
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,517
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>大概一年前我就开始见他了
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>I started seeing him about a year ago.

373
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,347
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>自他离婚就从未和任何人在一起
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>He hadn't been with anyone since his divorce.

374
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:28,554
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>他很孤独  你明白吗
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>He was just lonely, you know?

375
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,924
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>我们在一起的时候  大多是在聊天
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>We'd spend most of his dates talking.

376
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,392
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>他带我到高级餐厅
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>He'd take me to fancy restaurants...

377
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,583
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>尽管我告诉他没必要这样
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>Even though I told him he didn't have to.

378
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,419
<14-7,BECKETT>但我觉得他是想尽量弄得
<14-7,BECKETT>But I think he wanted to make it feel

379
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,269
<14-5,BECKETT>正常一点
<14-5,BECKETT>As normal as possible.

380
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,228
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>然后有一天  他看见
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>Then one night, he saw...

381
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:47,397
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>我包里有本法律书
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>A law book in my bag.

382
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,558
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>我告诉他我做这行
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>I told him I was only working as an escort

383
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:54,392
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>是为了供自己读法律学校
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>To pay my way through law school.

384
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:57,536
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>几个月后  他说他的办公室
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>A few months later, he said he had an internship

385
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,526
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>需要一个实习生
<14-6,SCARLETT PRICE>Opening up in his office.

386
00:16:00,968 --> 00:16:02,657
<14-7,BECKETT>问我是否感兴趣
<14-7,BECKETT>Would I be interested?

387
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,095
<14-7,BECKETT>他想帮你脱离这一行
<14-7,BECKETT>He wanted to help you escape the life?

388
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,631
<14-9,SCARLETT PRICE>丹东是谁
<14-9,SCARLETT PRICE>Who's Danton?

389
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:11,516
<14-10,BECKETT>-不知道  -别对我们撒谎  斯嘉丽
<14-10,BECKETT>- I don't know. - Don't lie to us, Scarlett.

390
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,872
<14-10,BECKETT>我没有
<14-10,BECKETT>I'm not.

391
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,954
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>我知道他是管事的  但我从未见过他
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>I-I know he runs the business, but I've never met him.

392
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,105
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>我不是站街女
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>It's not like I'm a streetwalker

393
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:22,843
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>而他也没戴着软呢帽  穿长皮大衣
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>And he's in a fedora and a long fur coat.

394
00:16:22,843 --> 00:16:27,583
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>他控制整个流程  来掩盖他的身份
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>He's organized the entire operation to protect his identity.

395
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,110
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>女孩们都是独立签约
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>The girls are independent contractors.

396
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,057
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>客人们按号码来编排
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>The clients are all given numbers

397
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,132
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>因此我们不知道他们的姓
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>So we don't know their last names.

398
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:37,123
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>他们用信用卡付费
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>They pay the business by credit card.

399
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:41,884
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>我们的钱直接转到银行卡里
<14-11,SCARLETT PRICE>And our fees get deposited directly into our bank accounts.

400
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,343
<14-12,CASTLE>在女孩们和管理人之间
<14-12,CASTLE>Creating the perfect firewall

401
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:44,784
<14-12,CASTLE>形成完美的防火墙
<14-12,CASTLE>Between the girls and the management.

402
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,396
<14-13,BECKETT>因此当我们抓到你们
<14-13,BECKETT>So then when we arrest you

403
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:47,874
<14-13,BECKETT>你们也无法供出丹东
<14-13,BECKETT>You can't give up Danton.

404
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,207
<14-14,SCARLETT PRICE>因为我不知道他是谁
<14-14,SCARLETT PRICE>Because I don't know who he is.

405
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:58,648
<15-1,MONTGOMERY>我无法相信杰· 巴克利会嫖娼
<15-1,MONTGOMERY>I can't believe Jack Buckley was seeing prostitutes.

406
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,998
<15-2,BECKETT>是啊  但是他一天工作14小时
<15-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he worked 14 hours a day,

407
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,681
<15-2,BECKETT>没有社交生活
<15-2,BECKETT>Didn't have a social life.

408
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,401
<15-2,BECKETT>可能他只是需要陪伴
<15-2,BECKETT>Maybe he just wanted a little easy company.

409
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:07,620
<15-3,CASTLE>但事情还是有点疑问
<15-3,CASTLE>Well, the math just doesn't add up, though.

410
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,435
<15-3,CASTLE>巴克利被警告远离丹东
<15-3,CASTLE>Buckley was warned to back off Danton.

411
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:11,784
<15-3,CASTLE>为什么巴克利会调查
<15-3,CASTLE>Why would Buckley be investigating

412
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:13,933
<15-3,CASTLE>他在享受的应召服务呢
<15-3,CASTLE>A call girl service he was using?

413
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:15,741
<15-4,BECKETT>可能丹东试图敲诈巴克利
<15-4,BECKETT>Maybe Danton tried to blackmail Buckley

414
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:16,886
<15-4,BECKETT>却引火烧身了
<15-4,BECKETT>And it backfired.

415
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,941
<15-5,CASTLE>然后丹东就通过恐吓他大舅子
<15-5,CASTLE>So then Danton tried to scare Buckley

416
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,470
<15-5,CASTLE>来吓吓他
<15-5,CASTLE>By threatening his brother-in-law.

417
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,341
<15-5,CASTLE>然而没起作用  丹东就杀了巴克利
<15-5,CASTLE>And then when that didn't work, Danton killed Buckley.

418
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,593
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>没错  先尽全力查找
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>All right. Let's find out everything we can

419
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:26,621
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>丹东是何许人也
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>About this Danton character.

420
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:27,958
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>让莱恩和埃斯波西托明天早上
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>Have Ryan and Esposito reach out to

421
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,678
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>查查那家应召公司
<15-6,MONTGOMERY>Vice in the morning.

422
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,713
<15-7,BECKETT>是  长官
<15-7,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

423
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,950
<15-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我需要你签署对杰赛普的控告
<15-8,BECKETT>Castle, I need you to sign these charges against Jessup

424
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,380
<15-8,BECKETT>然后我再寄到市区
<15-8,BECKETT>So I can send him downtown.

425
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,602
<15-8,BECKETT>怎么
<15-8,BECKETT>What?

426
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:43,756
<15-9,BECKETT>不  别告诉我  你觉得他还不错
<15-9,BECKETT>No, don't tell me you've got a soft spot for this guy.

427
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:45,229
<15-10,CASTLE>他是个文字大师
<15-10,CASTLE>He's a wordsmith.

428
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,409
<15-11,BECKETT>好吧  没关系
<15-11,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

429
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:51,109
<15-12,BECKETT>你好  我是贝克特
<15-12,BECKETT>Hi, it's Beckett.

430
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:53,378
<15-12,BECKETT>终止对杰赛普的控告
<15-12,BECKETT>Uh, charges are being dropped against Jessup.

431
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:55,666
<15-12,BECKETT>放了他吧  好  谢谢
<15-12,BECKETT>Process him out. All right. Thank you.

432
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:59,451
<15-12,BECKETT>希望你们相处愉快
<15-12,BECKETT>I hope the two of you are very happy together.

433
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:04,579
<16-1,CASTLE>你没事吧
<16-1,CASTLE>Are you okay?

434
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:07,521
<16-2,SCARLETT PRICE>有事  断了一个鞋跟
<16-2,SCARLETT PRICE>No. I...broke a heel.

435
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,851
<16-3,CASTLE>我猜一下  这是你最爱的一双鞋
<16-3,CASTLE>Let me guess. They were your favorite pair,

436
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:13,244
<16-3,CASTLE>家族世代相传
<16-3,CASTLE>Passed through your family for generations.

437
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:16,859
<16-4,SCARLETT PRICE>我的曾祖母穿过这双鞋坐着"五月花"号
<16-4,SCARLETT PRICE>My great-great-grandmother wore them over on the "Mayflower."

438
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,166
<16-5,CASTLE>我就知道
<16-5,CASTLE>I knew it.

439
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,394
<16-5,CASTLE>那像你这么漂亮的女孩怎么
<16-5,CASTLE>So what's a nice girl like you...

440
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,370
<16-6,SCARLETT PRICE>想知道  那是你的底线
<16-6,SCARLETT PRICE>Really? That's your line?

441
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,915
<16-7,CASTLE>我很传统
<16-7,CASTLE>I'm old-fashioned.

442
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,639
<16-7,CASTLE>我开着一辆蓝色破甲壳虫来到纽约
<16-7,CASTLE>I came to New York in this ancient blue beetle.

443
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:33,863
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>底板已锈迹斑斑
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>The floor was so rusted,

444
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,228
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>而且从中间凹陷了
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>It literally sagged in the middle.

445
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:40,157
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>但我仍然记得穿过那座桥
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>But I can still remember coming over the bridge

446
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:43,057
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>看到这座城市就在我眼前
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>And seeing the city right there in front of me.

447
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,978
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>我以为一切都会很美好
<16-8,SCARLETT PRICE>I thought everything was gonna be perfect.

448
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,170
<16-9,CASTLE>我有预感这个故事没走向美好
<16-9,CASTLE>Something tells me this story takes a turn for the worse.

449
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,048
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>第一天晚上  有人弄开我的车
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>The first night, uh, somebody broke into my car

450
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,658
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>偷走了我所有的东西
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>And stole all my stuff.

451
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:58,999
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>然后本该合住的大学朋友
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>Then the college friend I was gonna stay with

452
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,281
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>告诉我她男朋友要搬进来了
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>Told me her boyfriend was moving in.

453
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:04,043
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>-我得另找地方  -惨
<16-10,SCARLETT PRICE>-  I had to find another place. - Ooh.

454
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,405
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>但不管怎样  我活下来了
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>But somehow, I survived.

455
00:19:06,877 --> 00:19:10,655
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>一整年基本没吃什么  住在衣橱里
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>Spent a year barely eating, Living in a closet.

456
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,395
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>当一个朋友提起做这个的时候
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>When a friend mentioned doing this,

457
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:16,042
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>我想  不可能比现在差吧
<16-12,SCARLETT PRICE>I thought...couldn't be worse.

458
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:17,987
<16-13,CASTLE>是这样吗
<16-13,CASTLE>And is it?

459
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,745
<16-14,SCARLETT PRICE>其实更糟糕
<16-14,SCARLETT PRICE>Mostly no.

460
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:26,534
<16-14,SCARLETT PRICE>谢谢你听我说这些
<16-14,SCARLETT PRICE>Thanks for listening.

<16-19,BECKETT>- No. - But I want to.

465

<16-21,BECKETT>你干嘛这么担心  卡塞尔
<16-21,BECKETT>Why are you so worried, Castle?

466
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,439
<16-21,BECKETT>你不是个酷老爸吗
<16-21,BECKETT>I thought you were the cool dad.

470
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,568
<17-3,CASTLE>不是  我是问阿丽克西斯的秘密是什么
<17-3,CASTLE>No, what's Alexis' secret

471
00:19:59,568 --> 00:20:00,901
<17-3,CASTLE>她想告诉贝克特却不愿告诉我
<17-3,CASTLE>That she'll tell Beckett about but not me?

472
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,437
<17-4,MARTHA>我不知道  有些事情女人
<17-4,MARTHA>I don't know. There are some things a woman

473

478
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,961
<17-6,MARTHA>很显然  阿拉克西斯崇拜贝克特
<17-6,MARTHA>And obviously, Alexis looks up to Beckett.

479
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,227
<17-6,MARTHA>她聪慧  坚强又独立
<17-6,MARTHA>And Beckett's smart and strong and independent.

483
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,648
<17-8,MARTHA>-不能体会阿里克西斯的心情  -40
<17-8,MARTHA>- For what Alexis is going through right now. - Forty?

484
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,335

486
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:31,037
<17-10,MARTHA>你怕阿里克西斯比你想象的更像
<17-10,MARTHA>You're afraid Alexis has more Rick Castle in her

487

493
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,900
<17-13,CASTLE>你和贝克特谈了些什么  你大可不必
<17-13,CASTLE>What you talked about with Beckett, you don't have to.

494
00:20:44,217 --> 00:20:45,908

496
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,317
<17-15,MARTHA>你为什么不直接问他
<17-15,MARTHA>Why didn't you just ask her?

497
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:53,846
<17-16,CASTLE>那样就显得我很爱管闲事
<17-16,CASTLE>Because that would be prying,

498
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,753
<17-16,CASTLE>酷老爸们是不会那样做的
<17-16,CASTLE>And cool dads don't do that.

500
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,879
<17-16,CASTLE>去求贝克特告诉他们
<17-16,CASTLE>And they beg Beckett to tell 'em.

501

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,968
<18-24,ESPOSITO>给监狱打个电话  让他们把托内利带来
<18-24,ESPOSITO>You call the prison. Get 'em bring Tonelli over here.

534
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,368
<19-1,CASTLE>你们看见贝克特了吗
<19-1,CASTLE>Hey, you guys see Beckett?

535
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:22,803
<19-2,ESPOSITO>她和头一起去市政厅汇报新案情了
<19-2,ESPOSITO>She went with the captain to update city hall on the case.

536
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,081
<19-2,ESPOSITO>她应该马上就回来了
<19-2,ESPOSITO>She'll be here in a minute.

537
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:24,885
<19-3,RYAN>出什么事了吗
<19-3,RYAN>Something wrong?

538
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:26,636
<19-4,CASTLE>没有  有
<19-4,CASTLE>No. Yes.

539
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,562
<19-4,CASTLE>我觉得我女儿在对我隐瞒什么
<19-4,CASTLE>I think my daughter might be keeping something from me.

540
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,664
<19-5,RYAN>-可能她被开出学校了  -什么
<19-5,RYAN>- Maybe she got kicked outta school.  - What?

541
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:34,103
<19-7,ESPOSITO>或者她在吸毒
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Or she's doing drugs.

542
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,058
<19-8,RYAN>青少年怀孕率正在上升
<19-8,RYAN>Mm-hmm. Teen pregnancy is on the rise.

543
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:38,563
<19-10,CASTLE>行了  你们见过我女儿
<19-10,CASTLE>Whoa. All right, you've met my daughter.

544
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,805
<19-10,CASTLE>她已经尽力做到完美了
<19-10,CASTLE>You know that she is the closest thing to perfect as humanly possible.

545
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,438
<19-11,RYAN>卡塞尔  你跟我们做事这么久了
<19-11,RYAN>Castle, come on. You've been with us long enough to know

546
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:47,054
<19-11,RYAN>应该知道人常常表里不一
<19-11,RYAN>That people are never who you think they are.

547
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,600
<19-11,RYAN>很可能你的完美女儿并不是
<19-11,RYAN>Isn't it possible your perfect daughter

548
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,579
<19-11,RYAN>你想象的那样完美
<19-11,RYAN>Isn't as perfect as you think?

549
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,013
<19-12,BECKETT>丹东到了没
<19-12,BECKETT>Is Danton here yet?

550
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:54,507
<19-13,ESPOSITO>到了  在一号审讯室
<19-13,ESPOSITO>Yep. Interrogation room one.

551
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:55,798
<19-14,CASTLE>等等  丹东
<19-14,CASTLE>Wait, Danton?

552
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,490
<19-15,BECKETT>走吧  卡塞尔  快跟上
<19-15,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. Keep up.

553
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,793
<20-1,BECKETT>我们带你来是想谈谈丹东
<20-1,BECKETT>We brought you in here to talk about Danton.

554
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:03,639
<20-2,DAN TONELLI>陈芝麻烂谷子了
<20-2,DAN TONELLI>Ancient history.

555
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:06,432
<20-3,CASTLE>这上面说  巴克利和你达成了一份
<20-3,CASTLE>It says here, Buckley made a plea deal with you--

556
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,039
<20-3,CASTLE>认罪协议  用7年换20年
<20-3,CASTLE>7 years instead of 20.

557
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:10,645
<20-3,CASTLE>但我听说巴克利不涉及潜规则
<20-3,CASTLE>But I heard Buckley doesn't make deals.

558
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:12,665
<20-4,DAN TONELLI>我能说什么呢  只能说我运气好
<20-4,DAN TONELLI>What could I say? I got lucky.

559
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:15,246
<20-5,BECKETT>巴克利同意做交易的唯一原因是
<20-5,BECKETT>The only reason that Buckley would agree to a deal

560
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,131
<20-5,BECKETT>你能还他更大的人情
<20-5,BECKETT>Is because you brought him something big in return.

561
00:23:17,215 --> 00:23:18,761
<20-5,BECKETT>那是什么呢
<20-5,BECKETT>So what was it?

562
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,258
<20-6,DAN TONELLI>-你们为什么不问他  -因为他死了
<20-6,DAN TONELLI>- Why don't you ask him?  - Because he's dead.

563
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,641
<20-8,DAN TONELLI>什么  怎么死的
<20-8,DAN TONELLI>What? How?

564
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:25,637
<20-9,BECKETT>两天前他被谋杀了
<20-9,BECKETT>He was murdered two nights ago.

565
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,204
<20-9,BECKETT>我们认为
<20-9,BECKETT>We believe that the same person

566
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,806
<20-9,BECKETT>你的接班人就是凶手
<20-9,BECKETT>Who took over your operation's killed him...

567
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:32,832
<20-10,BECKETT>有什么好笑的
<20-10,BECKETT>What's so funny?

568
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:35,508
<20-11,DAN TONELLI>那样的话  他得是自杀
<20-11,DAN TONELLI>Well, you see, that would make it a suicide.

569
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,073
<20-12,CASTLE>-自杀  -等等
<20-12,CASTLE>- Suicide?  - Wait a minute.

570
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,282
<20-13,BECKETT>你是说杰克·巴克利就是新丹东
<20-13,BECKETT>You're saying that Jack Buckley was the new Danton?

571
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:43,837
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>是巴克利跟我做的交易
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>Buckley made me a deal.

572
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:46,609
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>我给他提供客户名单  还有那些小姐们
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>I provide him with my client list, my girls,

573
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,811
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>他帮我减13年刑
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>He knocks 13 years off my sentence.

574
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,510
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>那肯定无需多想
<20-14,DAN TONELLI>It was a no-brainer.

575
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,860
<20-15,CASTLE>我们的检察官拉皮条
<20-15,CASTLE>Our D.A. was a pimp.

576
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,832
<20-15,CASTLE>杰克·巴克利就是丹东
<20-15,CASTLE>Jack Buckley was Danton.

577
00:23:56,231 --> 00:23:57,978
<21-1,CASTLE>所以所有搜查都没有成果
<21-1,CASTLE>That's why all vice's warrants failed.

578
00:23:58,256 --> 00:23:59,296
<21-1,CASTLE>搜查令得经过他手
<21-1,CASTLE>They had to go through the D.A's office,

579
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:00,665
<21-1,CASTLE>巴克利知道他们来了
<21-1,CASTLE>And Buckley saw them coming.

580
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,032
<21-1,CASTLE>他处在保护应召公司的最佳位置
<21-1,CASTLE>He was in the perfect position to protect his operation.

581
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,725
<21-2,BECKETT>但为什么一个受人尊敬的检察官
<21-2,BECKETT>But why would a respected prosecutor

582
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:06,941
<21-2,BECKETT>会去拉皮条
<21-2,BECKETT>Become a pimp?

583
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:08,957
<21-3,CASTLE>-为了那些装备  -是因为钱
<21-3,CASTLE>-The outfits.  - It was the money.

584
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:11,839
<21-4,ESPOSITO>巴克利的前妻把他的钱全卷走了
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Buckley's ex-wife took him to the cleaners.

585
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,703
<21-4,ESPOSITO>要付赡养费  还有自己的账单
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Between alimony and his own bills,

586
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,377
<21-4,ESPOSITO>巴克利早破产了
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Buckley was beyond broke.

587
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:17,617
<21-5,CASTLE>我敢打赌肯定不止因为钱
<21-5,CASTLE>You know what? I'm bettin' it was more than just the money.

588
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:20,148
<21-5,CASTLE>每个人都在谈论杰克·巴克利有多厉害
<21-5,CASTLE>Everybody's talking about how great Jack Buckley was,

589
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,803
<21-5,CASTLE>他代表的是法律
<21-5,CASTLE>How he was the law.

590
00:24:21,868 --> 00:24:23,084
<21-5,CASTLE>一旦你开始那样想
<21-5,CASTLE>You start thinking like that,

591
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:24,713
<21-5,CASTLE>有时候你就会觉得
<21-5,CASTLE>Sometimes you can start thinking

592
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,761
<21-5,CASTLE>你自己高于法律
<21-5,CASTLE>Maybe you are above the law.

593
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:28,495
<21-5,CASTLE>以为自己能解决任何事情
<21-5,CASTLE>That you can get away with anything.

594
00:24:29,397 --> 00:24:31,029
<21-6,BECKETT>长官  市长是怎样处理这个消息的
<21-6,BECKETT>Sir, how did the mayor handle the news?

595
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:32,388
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>你们不会想知道的
<21-7,MONTGOMERY>Whew. You don't want to know..

596
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:35,288
<21-8,BECKETT>但是  这样讲不通
<21-8,BECKETT>Okay, this doesn't make any sense.

597
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,549
<21-8,BECKETT>如果巴克利是新丹东  那为什么蒙面人
<21-8,BECKETT>If Buckley was the new Danton, then why would the masked man

598
00:24:38,622 --> 00:24:40,608
<21-8,BECKETT>要告诉巴克利远离丹东
<21-8,BECKETT>Tell Buckley to back off of Danton?

599
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:42,420
<21-8,BECKETT>巴克利不会威胁他自己的
<21-8,BECKETT>Buckley wouldn't threaten himself.

600
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:46,640
<21-8,BECKETT>除非巴克利已经不是老板了
<21-8,BECKETT>Unless Buckley wasn't the boss anymore.

601
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:48,445
<21-9,MONTGOMERY>-恶意的接收  -肯定是
<21-9,MONTGOMERY>-A hostile takeover.  - Of course.

602
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:51,357
<21-10,CASTLE>我们知道丹东只是商业名
<21-10,CASTLE>We know Danton was just a business name.

603
00:24:51,453 --> 00:24:52,874
<21-10,CASTLE>那么  远离丹东
<21-10,CASTLE>So "back off of Danton"

604
00:24:52,937 --> 00:24:54,827
<21-10,CASTLE>就是新老板在告诉旧老板
<21-10,CASTLE>Was the new boss telling the old boss,

605
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,289
<21-10,CASTLE>"不要牵牵绊绊
<21-10,CASTLE>"Don't resist the takeover

606
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,500
<21-10,CASTLE>否则就要他声名扫地"
<21-10,CASTLE>Or I'll start ruining reputations."

607
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,246
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>理论上讲得通  但怎样证明
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>Makes sense in theory, but how do you prove?

608
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,529
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>找个小姐来谈谈
<21-11,MONTGOMERY>We talk to the call girl.

609
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,556
<21-12,BECKETT>不可能
<21-12,BECKETT>There is no way

610
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,023
<21-12,BECKETT>斯嘉丽不知道巴克利是老板
<21-12,BECKETT>That Scarlett didn't know that Buckley was in charge.

611
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:12,513
<22-1,CASTLE>不  说真的  阿里克西斯昨晚
<22-1,CASTLE>No, seriously, what did Alexis

612
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:13,514
<22-1,CASTLE>到底对你说了些什么
<22-1,CASTLE>Tell you last night?

613
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,031
<22-2,BECKETT>我答应她不说出去的
<22-2,BECKETT>I promised I wouldn't say.

614
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:18,144
<22-3,CASTLE>那好  至少告诉我是不是坏事
<22-3,CASTLE>Well, at least tell me if it was bad.

615
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,622
<22-4,BECKETT>顺便替你解脱烦恼吗
<22-4,BECKETT>And put you out of your misery?

616
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,832
<22-5,BECKETT>-我们想找斯嘉丽  -她在收拾东西
<22-5,BECKETT>- We're looking for Scarlett.  - She's packing her things.

617
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,585
<22-6,NICOLE>我们不能让应召女郎在这里工作
<22-6,NICOLE>We can't have call girls working here.

618
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:28,959
<22-7,CASTLE>是啊  只准拉皮条的
<22-7,CASTLE>No, only pimps.

619
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,470
<22-8,SCARLETT PRICE>探长
<22-8,SCARLETT PRICE>Detective.

620
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:34,705
<22-9,BECKETT>能让我们单独谈谈吗
<22-9,BECKETT>Could you give us a moment, please?

621
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:40,478
<22-10,BECKETT>斯嘉丽  你对我们撒谎了
<22-10,BECKETT>Scarlett, you lied to us.

622
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,664
<22-10,BECKETT>巴克利是你们的老板
<22-10,BECKETT>Buckley was running the call girl ring,

623
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:44,614
<22-10,BECKETT>而你不可能不知道
<22-10,BECKETT>And there's no way that you didn't know.

624
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,524
<22-11,SCARLETT PRICE>求你们了  我不得不撒谎
<22-11,SCARLETT PRICE>Please. I had to lie.

625
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,375
<22-11,SCARLETT PRICE>如果他知道我全招了  他会杀了我
<22-11,SCARLETT PRICE>He'd kill me if he thought I told you anything.

626
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,848
<22-12,CASTLE>谁会杀你  新丹东吗
<22-12,CASTLE>Who'd kill you, the new Danton?

627
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:53,493
<22-13,BECKETT>有人接管了巴克利的生意  那个人是谁
<22-13,BECKETT>Someone took over Buckley's business. Who was it?

628
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:57,620
<22-14,SCARLETT PRICE>-回答我  -他以前是替巴克利工作的
<22-14,SCARLETT PRICE>- Answer me.  - He used to work for Buckley.

629
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,223
<22-14,SCARLETT PRICE>他负责保证我们的安全以及
<22-14,SCARLETT PRICE>He made sure no one hurt the girls and

630
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,422
<22-15,BECKETT>-客户付款  -他叫什么名字
<22-15,BECKETT>- Everyone paid.  - What was his name?

631
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:02,210
<22-16,SCARLETT PRICE>我不能告诉你
<22-16,SCARLETT PRICE>I can't tell you that.

632
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:03,714
<22-17,BECKETT>斯嘉丽  我不想再和你玩下去了
<22-17,BECKETT>Scarlett, I'm done playing.

633
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,975
<22-17,BECKETT>你一直在说谎  别以为我不能
<22-17,BECKETT>You've done nothing but lie to us. Don't think that I'm not

634
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:07,678
<22-17,BECKETT>以妨碍司法公正  或我能想到的罪名
<22-17,BECKETT>Gonna send you away for obstruction of justice

635
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:09,063
<22-17,BECKETT>送你进监狱
<22-17,BECKETT>And anything else that I can think of.

636
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:10,649
<22-18,SCARLETT PRICE>他会杀了我的
<22-18,SCARLETT PRICE>He'll kill me.

637
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:12,126
<22-19,CASTLE>我们不会让这种事发生的
<22-19,CASTLE>We won't let that happen.

638
00:26:12,127 --> 00:26:14,020
<22-19,CASTLE>贝克特探长可以帮助你
<22-19,CASTLE>Detective Beckett can help you,

639
00:26:14,057 --> 00:26:15,602
<22-19,CASTLE>但你得先帮助我们
<22-19,CASTLE>But you have to help us first.

640
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:16,977
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>然后我会怎样呢
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>And then what happens to me?

641
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,230
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>你以为我就能当律师了吗
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>You think I'm gonna be a lawyer now?

642
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,608
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>杰克打算给我写封推荐信
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>Jack was gonna write me a letter of recommendation,

643
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,414
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>拉点关系  给我找份工作
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>Pull some strings to get me a job.

644
00:26:23,487 --> 00:26:27,441
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>-现在谁会帮我  -老实说  没有人
<22-20,SCARLETT PRICE>- Who's gonna help me now?  - Honestly? No one.

645
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,136
<22-21,CASTLE>你得自己帮助自己  斯嘉丽
<22-21,CASTLE>You're gonna have to do it by yourself, Scarlett.

646
00:26:29,178 --> 00:26:31,125
<22-21,CASTLE>不过我相信你可以
<22-21,CASTLE>And I got a feeling that you can.

647
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:34,453
<22-21,CASTLE>告诉我们新老板是谁
<22-21,CASTLE>Tell us who the new boss is...

648
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:36,674
<22-21,CASTLE>贝克特探长可以保证
<22-21,CASTLE>And detective Beckett will make sure

649
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,045
<22-21,CASTLE>没有人会知道是你招供的
<22-21,CASTLE>No one knows it was you who talked to us.

650
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:43,610
<22-22,SCARLETT PRICE>你保证
<22-22,SCARLETT PRICE>You promise?

651
00:26:47,155 --> 00:26:48,839
<22-23,BECKETT>是的
<22-23,BECKETT>Yes.

652
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:52,237
<22-24,SCARLETT PRICE>他叫约翰·诺克斯
<22-24,SCARLETT PRICE>His name is John Knox.

653
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,201
<22-25,CASTLE>诺克斯  但那是
<22-25,CASTLE>Knox? But that's--

654
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:56,556
<22-26,BECKETT>巴克利抓进来的那个人
<22-26,BECKETT>The guy that Buckley dragged in here in handcuffs.

655
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:01,891
<23-1,BECKETT>一个检察官怎么能和罪犯做生意
<23-1,BECKETT>How does a prosecutor get into business with a criminal?

656
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:03,968
<23-2,CASTLE>拉皮条的在外面混不容易啊
<23-2,CASTLE>Well, it's hard out there for a pimp...

657
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,659
<23-2,CASTLE>他又是个检察官
<23-2,CASTLE>Who's also a D.A.

658
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:08,406
<23-2,CASTLE>以他写小说很适合
<23-2,CASTLE>Ooh, that'd be a good character for a novel.

659
00:27:08,655 --> 00:27:10,173
<23-4,CASTLE>一个明星检察官
<23-4,CASTLE>A star prosecutor who's always excelled

660
00:27:10,273 --> 00:27:11,674
<23-4,CASTLE>做任何事都略胜一筹
<23-4,CASTLE>At anything he's ever done...

661
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:13,615
<23-4,CASTLE>他可能没想到做一个拉皮条的
<23-4,CASTLE>He couldn't possibly imagine that being a pimp

662
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,726
<23-4,CASTLE>会超出自己的能力范围
<23-4,CASTLE>Would be a bigger job than he could handle by himself.

663
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,249
<23-4,CASTLE>但某一天他接到一个电话
<23-4,CASTLE>But one day he gets a call--

664
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,470
<23-4,CASTLE>他的一个小姐被客户给打了
<23-4,CASTLE>One of his girls has been knocked around by a client.

665
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:21,789
<23-4,CASTLE>他意识到对此束手无策
<23-4,CASTLE>He realizes there's nothing he can do about it.

666
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:23,595
<23-5,BECKETT>-他是一个公众人物  -然后呢
<23-5,BECKETT>- He's a very public figure.  - Mm-hmm.

667
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:26,206
<23-6,CASTLE>因此一个白领检察官决定雇用
<23-6,CASTLE>So a white-collar prosecutor decides to hire

668
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:28,153
<23-6,CASTLE>一个蓝领保镖
<23-6,CASTLE>A blue-collared enforcer.

669
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,578
<23-6,CASTLE>又不能明目张胆的招人
<23-6,CASTLE>Can't exactly take out an ad on craigslist for that,

670
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:33,557
<23-6,CASTLE>但幸运的是  他有一大票
<23-6,CASTLE>But fortunately enough, he has a big stack

671
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,219
<23-6,CASTLE>合格的候选人在手上
<23-6,CASTLE>Of qualified candidates sitting right on his desk.

672
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,222
<23-7,BECKETT>他就从中挑选了约翰·诺克斯
<23-7,BECKETT>Which is where he found John Knox.

673
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,444
<23-7,BECKETT>他总能有办法避免监禁
<23-7,BECKETT>A criminal who mostly managed to stay out of prison.

674
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,135
<23-8,CASTLE>-也让他成为了不起的罪犯  -没错
<23-8,CASTLE>- Which makes him a smart criminal.  - Yeah.

675
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,460
<23-9,BECKETT>巴克利提出交易
<23-9,BECKETT>Buckley offers him a deal--

676
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:45,550
<23-10,CASTLE>"来替我工作  我帮你销案"
<23-10,CASTLE>"Come work for me, I'll throw your case."

677
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,196
<23-10,CASTLE>诺克斯同意了
<23-10,CASTLE>And Knox does.

678
00:27:47,243 --> 00:27:48,837
<23-12,CASTLE>有段时间  大家都高兴
<23-12,CASTLE>For a while, everyone's happy.

679
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:49,895
<23-12,CASTLE>但后来诺克斯决定
<23-12,CASTLE>But then Knox decides

680
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:51,721
<23-12,CASTLE>他不再想当老二了
<23-12,CASTLE>He's not happy being number two anymore.

681
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:53,093
<23-12,CASTLE>他拿了巴克利的客户名单
<23-12,CASTLE>He takes Buckley's client list,

682
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,511
<23-12,CASTLE>并让巴克利走人
<23-12,CASTLE>And let Buckley to take a hike.

683
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,363
<23-13,BECKETT>他知道巴克利如果不暴露自己
<23-13,BECKETT>Knowing that Buckley can't do anything about it

684
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:58,367
<23-13,BECKETT>-拿他毫无办法  -没错
<23-13,BECKETT>- Without risking exposure.  - Mm-hmm.

685
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,154
<23-14,CASTLE>但巴克利一生从未在斗争面前退缩
<23-14,CASTLE>But Buckley's never backed down from a fight in his life.

686
00:28:00,206 --> 00:28:02,726
<23-14,CASTLE>他让警察把他抓进来
<23-14,CASTLE>He gets the cops to drag Knox down to his office

687
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:03,958
<23-14,CASTLE>提醒他谁才是老板
<23-14,CASTLE>To remind him who's boss.

688
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,196
<23-15,BECKETT>但诺克斯以此为切口
<23-15,BECKETT>But Knox took it up a notch,

689
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,759
<23-15,BECKETT>威胁巴克利的大舅子
<23-15,BECKETT>Sending a warning shot across Buckley's bow

690
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,578
<23-15,BECKETT>来警告他
<23-15,BECKETT>By threatening his brother-in-law.

691
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:10,098
<23-16,CASTLE>但巴克利不愿意退让
<23-16,CASTLE>And when Buckley wouldn't back down

692
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,259
<23-16,CASTLE>诺克斯把他从停车场顶楼扔了下来
<23-16,CASTLE>Knox threw him off the roof of a parking garage.

693
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:14,066
<23-17,BECKETT>天哪  如果我们有证据就好了
<23-17,BECKETT>Jeez, if only we have some proof.

694
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:16,328
<23-18,CASTLE>要什么证据啊  这么精彩的故事
<23-18,CASTLE>Who needs proof? What a great story.

695
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,645
<23-18,CASTLE>不过  诺克斯有不在场证据
<23-18,CASTLE>Of course, Knox has an alibi.

696
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:22,277
<23-19,BECKETT>但是  可能你是对的
<23-19,BECKETT>You know, maybe you're right.

697
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:26,323
<23-19,BECKETT>可能诺克斯够聪明  他可以派别人
<23-19,BECKETT>Maybe Knox is smart. Maybe he sent someone else.

698
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,888
<23-20,CASTLE>我喜欢情节曲折离奇
<23-20,CASTLE>Ooh, I like the twist--

699
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:29,688
<23-20,CASTLE>保镖也有保镖
<23-20,CASTLE>The enforcer has an enforcer.

700
00:28:31,113 --> 00:28:33,159
<23-20,CASTLE>但是是谁呢
<23-20,CASTLE>But who?

701
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,573
<23-20,CASTLE>不  这个效果不错  这个很好
<23-20,CASTLE>No, it worked out well. It was good.

702
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:38,417
<24-1,JOHN KNOX>行  我待会再跟你们谈  好吗
<24-1,JOHN KNOX>You know, I'll talk to you guys later, okay?

703
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:42,111
<24-2,CASTLE>你好  还记得我们吗
<24-2,CASTLE>Hi. Remember us?

704
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,340
<24-3,JOHN KNOX>我当然记得你
<24-3,JOHN KNOX>I definitely remember you.

705
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:46,693
<24-4,BECKETT>有几个问题想问你
<24-4,BECKETT>We need to ask you a few questions.

706
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,284
<24-5,JOHN KNOX>我已经答过了
<24-5,JOHN KNOX>I already answered your questions.

707
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,014
<24-6,CASTLE>可能你没看到她的警徽
<24-6,CASTLE>Maybe you didn't see the badge.

708
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:51,906
<24-7,JOHN KNOX>我看到了
<24-7,JOHN KNOX>Oh, I saw it.

709
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:55,325
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>小姐们准备好了吗  棒极了
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>You ladies ready? Excellent.

710
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:57,968
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>祝你们两位玩得愉快
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>You two have a nice evening.

711
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,569
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>谁饿了  你们想干什么
<24-8,JOHN KNOX>Who's hungry? What do you guys feel like?

712
00:29:00,645 --> 00:29:01,704
<24-9,CASTLE>你不打算拦住他吗
<24-9,CASTLE>Aren't you gonna stop him?

713
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,823
<24-10,BECKETT>我不能  除非我们逮捕他
<24-10,BECKETT>I can't. Unless we arrest him,

714
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,499
<24-10,BECKETT>根据法律  他没义务跟我们谈话
<24-10,BECKETT>The law says that he doesn't have to talk to us,

715
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:09,596
<24-10,BECKETT>-他明白这一点  -那就逮捕他啊
<24-10,BECKETT>- And he knows that.  - So arrest him.

716
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:11,152
<24-12,BECKETT>凭什么呢
<24-12,BECKETT>On what grounds?

717
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,759
<24-12,BECKETT>我们向斯嘉丽保证过  不把她扯进来
<24-12,BECKETT>We promised Scarlett that we'd keep her out of it.

718
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:16,069
<24-12,BECKETT>除非我们有证据
<24-12,BECKETT>So unless we get some evidence,

719
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,878
<24-12,BECKETT>要不他就可以拒绝
<24-12,BECKETT>He's getting away with this.

720
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,370
<24-12,BECKETT>斯嘉丽
<24-12,BECKETT>Scarlett?

721
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,676
<25-1,CASTLE>你受伤了
<25-1,CASTLE>You're hurt.

722
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:37,854
<25-2,SCARLETT PRICE>我不知道还能去哪里
<25-2,SCARLETT PRICE>I didn't know where else to go.

723
00:29:42,602 --> 00:29:44,088
<26-1,CASTLE>过来  坐这里
<26-1,CASTLE>Come. Sit down.

724
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,470
<26-1,CASTLE>你该去医院看看
<26-1,CASTLE>You should go to a hospital.

725
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:51,333
<26-2,SCARLETT PRICE>只是一点擦伤  我没事
<26-2,SCARLETT PRICE>It's just a few bruises. I'll be fine.

726
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:53,618
<26-3,CASTLE>你怎么找到我的
<26-3,CASTLE>How did you find me?

727
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:56,111
<26-4,SCARLETT PRICE>出版公司的一个客户
<26-4,SCARLETT PRICE>A client in the publishing business

728
00:29:56,205 --> 00:29:57,776
<26-4,SCARLETT PRICE>把你的地址告诉了我
<26-4,SCARLETT PRICE>Gave me your address.

729
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,225
<26-5,SCARLETT PRICE>自己吃晚餐吗
<26-5,SCARLETT PRICE>Dinner for one?

730
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:03,329
<26-6,CASTLE>是的  家人都去了剧院
<26-6,CASTLE>Yeah, my family is at the theater.

731
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:04,897
<26-6,CASTLE>真好
<26-6,CASTLE>Good.

732
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:07,967
<26-7,SCARLETT PRICE>我真的不想让别人看到我这个样子
<26-7,SCARLETT PRICE>I wouldn't want anyone else to see me like this.

733
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:13,100
<26-8,CASTLE>是诺克斯干的吗
<26-8,CASTLE>Did Knox do this to you?

734
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,213
<26-9,SCARLETT PRICE>-已经无所谓了  -当然有所谓
<26-9,SCARLETT PRICE>- It doesn't matter. - Of course it does.

735
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,882
<26-10,CASTLE>你真的以为保护了他
<26-10,CASTLE>Do you think that by protecting him,

736
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:20,392
<26-10,CASTLE>就能救你自己吗  不可能
<26-10,CASTLE>You're saving yourself somehow? Because you're not.

737

00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,673
<31-11,JESSUP>-他们愿意收我  -真的
<31-11,JESSUP>- That's willing to admit me. - Really?

841
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,289
<31-13,JESSUP>没错  只需要出具一份
<31-13,JESSUP>Yeah. All I need is a letter of

842
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:31,621
<31-13,JESSUP>来自警局的推荐信
<31-13,JESSUP>Recommendation from police

843
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:34,495
<31-13,JESSUP>-所以我来了  能帮我写吗  -不行
<31-13,JESSUP>And I am in. Will you write it for me? - No!

844
00:35:34,952 --> 00:35:36,429
<31-16,CASTLE>-不是吧  -求你了  发发善心吧
<31-16,CASTLE>- What? - Come on. Have a heart.

845
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:38,806
<31-17,BECKETT>他是罪犯  如果我帮他写信
<31-17,BECKETT>He's a criminal. If I write him a letter,

846
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,563
<31-17,BECKETT>就要对他负责  我又不能
<31-17,BECKETT>I'll be responsible for him. I cannot watch you

847
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,802
<31-18,CASTLE>-一天24小时盯着你  -等等  你说什么
<31-18,CASTLE>- 24 hours a day. - Wait a minute. What'd you say?

848
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:44,736
<31-19,BECKETT>我要对他负责
<31-19,BECKETT>I would be responsible for him.

849
00:35:44,787 --> 00:35:46,778
<31-20,CASTLE>不  不是  你不能一天24小时...
<31-20,CASTLE>No, no, no. You can't watch him...

850
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,317
<31-20,CASTLE>你什么时候开始监视诺克斯
<31-20,CASTLE>When did you put the surveillance car on Knox?

851
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:50,496
<31-21,BECKETT>就在我们离开酒吧之后
<31-21,BECKETT>Right after we left the bar.

852
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:53,541
<31-22,CASTLE>后来他们盯了他一整晚
<31-22,CASTLE>And they followed them all night.

853
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:55,341
<31-23,BECKETT>-他凌晨两点回家  -那他如何打伤斯嘉丽
<31-23,BECKETT>-He got home on 2 a.m. - Then how could he have beaten up Scarlett?

854
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:56,552
<31-24,CASTLE>知不知道
<31-24,CASTLE>You guys do know that the deadbolt

855
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:58,932
<31-24,CASTLE>你们踹门的时候
<31-24,CASTLE>Wasn't set on this lock when you

856
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,365
<31-25,JESSUP>-插销根本没插进锁里  -什么
<31-25,JESSUP>- Guys kicked it in, right? - What?

857
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,732
<31-26,BECKETT>看吧  如果我说的不对
<31-26,BECKETT>See? If it would've been,

858
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,280
<31-27,JESSUP>这整个地方都该坏了
<31-27,JESSUP>This whole frame would've been destroyed.

859
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,444
<31-28,CASTLE>锁上门  这是绑架人质的常识
<31-28,CASTLE>Locking the door-- that's hostage taking 101.

860
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:11,965
<31-29,BECKETT>除非斯嘉丽不是人质
<31-29,BECKETT>Unless Scarlett wasn't a hostage.

861
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:14,251
<31-30,CASTLE>从一开始  她就在计划这一切
<31-30,CASTLE>She was in on it from the start.

862
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:15,806
<31-31,BECKETT>巴克利让她在办公室工作
<31-31,BECKETT>Buckley didn't set her up in his office

863
00:36:15,888 --> 00:36:17,020
<31-31,BECKETT>并非出于善心
<31-31,BECKETT>And he's out of the goodness of his heart.

864
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:20,041
<31-31,BECKETT>他需要人替他招揽生意
<31-31,BECKETT>He needed somebody working there to man the call girl business.

865
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,901
<31-32,CASTLE>没有意识到  他给了斯嘉丽机会
<31-32,CASTLE>Not realizing that he was giving Scarlett

866
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:24,589
<31-32,CASTLE>了解这个公司的一切
<31-32,CASTLE>Full access to every facet of his organization.

867
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,128
<31-33,BECKETT>不是诺克斯偷了客户名单
<31-33,BECKETT>Knox didn't steal the client list?

868
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:27,487
<31-33,BECKETT>是斯嘉丽给他的  这样他们才能
<31-33,BECKETT>Scarlett gave it to him so that the two of them

869
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,137
<31-33,BECKETT>一起打理生意
<31-33,BECKETT>Could go into business together.

870
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:31,150
<31-34,CASTLE>巴克利却不愿意放手  诺克斯杀之后快
<31-34,CASTLE>And when Buckley wouldn't walk away, Knox just kill him.

871
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,169
<31-34,CASTLE>没想到我们会发现应召女郎的事
<31-34,CASTLE>Never thinking we'd find out about the call girl ring.

872
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,942
<31-35,BECKETT>而当我们发现之后  斯嘉丽想到
<31-35,BECKETT>And then when we did, Scarlett realized

873
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,075
<31-35,BECKETT>救自己的唯一方法是牺牲诺克斯
<31-35,BECKETT>That the only way to save herself was by giving up Knox

874
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:39,376
<31-35,BECKETT>玩场最终受害者游戏  让你以为诺克斯
<31-35,BECKETT>By playing the ultimate victim, making you believe that Knox

875
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,581
<31-35,BECKETT>打伤了她  让我们以为她是自卫杀人
<31-35,BECKETT>Beat her up so we'd think she killed him out of self-defense.

876
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,396
<31-37,BECKETT>-我就是这样想的  -我们都是
<31-37,BECKETT>- And I felt for it. - We all did.

877
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,159
<31-38,JESSUP>我没有
<31-38,JESSUP>I didn't

878
00:36:47,011 --> 00:36:48,698

889
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,718
<32-13,CASTLE>她开着一辆蓝色破甲壳虫来到纽约
<32-13,CASTLE>She came to New York in an ancient blue beetle,

890
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:31,162
<32-13,CASTLE>底板已锈迹斑斑  中间几乎凹陷了
<32-13,CASTLE>The floor so rusted, it literally sagged in the middle.

891
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:33,745
<32-14,SCARLETT PRICE>卡塞尔  你怎么有这个号码
<32-14,SCARLETT PRICE>Castle. How did you get this number?

892
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:35,811
<32-15,CASTLE>有个出版商朋友
<32-15,CASTLE>I have a friend in the publishing business.

<32-16,SCARLETT PRICE>I'm sorry if I disappointed you.

<32-16,SCARLETT PRICE>我只是要找工作
<32-16,SCARLETT PRICE>I-I just needed to take a few more jobs

895
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:43,405
<32-16,SCARLETT PRICE>为了生计
<32-16,SCARLETT PRICE>To set myself up.

896
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:45,742
<32-17,CASTLE>你从没停止过利用我  对吗  斯嘉丽
<32-17,CASTLE>You never stop manipulating, do you, Scarlett?

897
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:47,722
<32-17,CASTLE>我本该很讶异  真的
<32-17,CASTLE>I should be impressed, really,

898
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:49,751
<32-17,CASTLE>你是多么轻易地玩弄我
<32-17,CASTLE>How easily you played me,

899
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:54,621
<32-17,CASTLE>而我却只觉得伤心
<32-17,CASTLE>But all I can think about is how sad it is...

900
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,925
<32-17,CASTLE>美貌和智慧配一颗腐朽的心灵  真浪费
<32-17,CASTLE>All that brains and beauty wasted on a heart gone rotten.

901
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,790
<32-17,CASTLE>你处心积虑防范别人
<32-17,CASTLE>You're so busy building up walls to keep people out,

902
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,009
<32-18,CASTLE>却不知道自己被困了
<32-18,CASTLE>You don't even realize that you're the one trapped inside...

903
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,535
<32-18,CASTLE>孤独一人
<32-18,CASTLE>All alone.

904
00:38:10,841 --> 00:38:12,396
<32-19,RYAN>请站起来
<32-19,RYAN>Will you stand up, please?

905
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:20,966
<32-20,RYAN>你有权保持沉默
<32-20,RYAN>You have the right to remain silent.

906
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,281

<32-20,RYAN>Anything you say can and will be used against you...

907
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:26,359
<32-21,CASTLE>谢谢
<32-21,CASTLE>Thanks.

908
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,640
<32-22,BECKETT>为什么
<32-22,BECKETT>For what?

909
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:29,801
<32-23,CASTLE>因为你没说  我说过了
<32-23,CASTLE>For not saying I told you so.

910
00:38:31,153 --> 00:38:33,253
<32-24,BECKETT>明天才开始说
<32-24,BECKETT>Oh, that starts tomorrow.

911
00:38:43,183 --> 00:38:46,616
<33-1,CASTLE>为什么抱我
<33-1,CASTLE>Oh! What was that for?

912
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:48,094
<33-2,ALEXIS>为了最好的老爸
<33-2,ALEXIS>For being the best dad ever.

913
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:50,531
<33-3,CASTLE>确实是  还有好多理由能说明这点
<33-3,CASTLE>It's true, you know. I have the novelty mug to prove it.

914
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,310
<33-4,ALEXIS>谢谢你相信我
<33-4,ALEXIS>Mm. Thanks for trusting me,

915
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:56,756
<33-4,ALEXIS>知道我有秘密  却没有逼我
<33-4,ALEXIS>For not pushing when you knew I was working something out.

916
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:00,584
<33-5,CASTLE>我知道  你准备好了就会告诉我
<33-5,CASTLE>Well... I knew when you were ready, you would tell me.

917
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:02,923
<33-6,ALEXIS>事情是这样的
<33-6,ALEXIS>So here it is...

918
00:39:06,134 --> 00:39:07,901
<33-6,ALEXIS>学校有一项交换生计划
<33-6,ALEXIS>My school is starting a foreign exchange program

919
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,182
<33-6,ALEXIS>去法国的
<33-6,ALEXIS>To France.

920
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:11,346
<33-7,CASTLE>-法国  -没错
<33-7,CASTLE>- France? - Yeah.

921
00:39:11,424 --> 00:39:14,041
<33-8,ALEXIS>-你不是被学校开除了  -没有
<33-8,ALEXIS>- You weren't kicked out of school? - No.

922
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:16,936
<33-10,ALEXIS>交换生要去三周
<33-10,ALEXIS>No, the program lasts three weeks,

923
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:18,912
<33-11,ALEXIS>所以没法陪你过生日  而且听说贝克特
<33-11,ALEXIS>And so I'd miss your birthday. And I knew that Beckett

924
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:20,417
<33-11,ALEXIS>大学时出国学习过一学期
<33-11,ALEXIS>Had spent a semester abroad in college,

925
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,945
<33-11,ALEXIS>我想问她这种经历
<33-11,ALEXIS>And I wanted to ask her if the experience

926
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,294
<33-12,CASTLE>-值不值得  -她怎么回答的
<33-12,CASTLE>- Was worth it. - And what'd she say?.

927
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,294
<33-13,ALEXIS>她说  还有几年我就得离家
<33-13,ALEXIS>She said that I'd be going off

928
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,768
<33-13,ALEXIS>去念大学
<33-13,ALEXIS>To college in a couple of years.

929
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,556
<33-13,ALEXIS>然后一切就会改变了
<33-13,ALEXIS>And that everything was gonna change,

930
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,469
<33-13,ALEXIS>也许现在就尝试改变是件好事
<33-13,ALEXIS>And maybe it'd be good if we got a taste of that change now.

931
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,519
<33-13,ALEXIS>这样啊
<33-13,ALEXIS>Well...

932
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:37,742
<33-14,CASTLE>她很有智慧
<33-14,CASTLE>She's a smart woman.

933
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:39,368
<33-14,CASTLE>的确是
<33-14,CASTLE>Yeah, she is.

934
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:43,932
<33-15,ALEXIS>但是我决定不走了
<33-15,ALEXIS>But I decided not to go anyway.

935
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,462
<33-15,ALEXIS>因为两年很快就会过去
<33-15,ALEXIS>Because two years will be here soon enough,

936
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:48,100
<33-15,ALEXIS>而且我已经准备好了礼物
<33-15,ALEXIS>And I already got you your present,

937
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:49,716
<33-15,ALEXIS>我想看你打开
<33-15,ALEXIS>And I want to watch you open it.

938
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,812
<33-16,CASTLE>我们要用冰激凌庆祝一下
<33-16,CASTLE>Mm. I say we celebrate with ice cream.

939
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,727
<33-17,ALEXIS>-不庆祝太傻了  -做我的服务员
<33-17,ALEXIS>- We'd be fools not to. - Serve me.

940
00:39:57,453 --> 00:39:58,497
<33-19,ALEXIS>巧克力的还是香草味的
<33-19,ALEXIS>Chocolate or vanilla?

941
