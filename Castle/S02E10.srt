61
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,350
<2-3,LANIE>但也有可能是
<2-3,LANIE>But it's likely a result of

<2-3,LANIE>跌下垃圾槽而致
<2-3,LANIE>His tumble down the trash chute.

<2-6,CASTLE>I happen to have a very acute sense of smell.

70
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:54,310
<2-8,LANIE>你知道在我出去约会之前
<2-8,LANIE>Do you know how long I have to shower

71
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,804

<2-8,LANIE>Before heading out on a date?

<2-11,RYAN>肯定是跌下来时  从他上衣里掉出来的
<2-11,RYAN>It must have fallen out of his jacket on the way down.

75
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,532
<2-12,BECKETT>没错  就是他

<2-12,BECKETT>And the driver's license has his address placed in Connecticut.

78
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,509
<2-13,RYAN>可能是来这见朋友
<2-13,RYAN>Maybe he's visiting someone in the building.

79
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,309
<2-14,CASTLE>-你是说路过  -我是莱恩
<2-14,CASTLE>- You mean dropping by,  - Ryan here.

<2-15,RYAN>Thanks, bro.

81
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,220
<2-15,RYAN>埃斯波西托在15楼
<2-15,RYAN>Esposito's up on 15.

82
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,118
<2-15,RYAN>他说找到案发现场了
<2-15,RYAN>Says he found out where our guy was shot.

83
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,517
<2-16,BECKETT>好  我们走吧
<2-16,BECKETT>All right. Let's go.

84
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,730
<3-1,ESPOSITO>从血迹来看  死者是在这里被枪杀的
<3-1,ESPOSITO>From the blood spatter, our guy was shot right here.

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,187
<3-1,ESPOSITO>然后
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Then...

86
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,170
<3-1,ESPOSITO>头朝下被推下垃圾槽的
<3-1,ESPOSITO>He was shoved head first down the chute.

87
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,870
<3-2,CASTLE>一个自己善后的凶手
<3-2,CASTLE>A killer who cleans up after himself.

88
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,171
<3-2,CASTLE>很像《美国狂魔》[电影名]
<3-2,CASTLE>Very "American Psycho."

89
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:41,044
<3-3,BECKETT>他可能是想
<3-3,BECKETT>He probably wanted

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,469
<3-3,BECKETT>神不知鬼不觉地把尸体扔出去
<3-3,BECKETT>To get out of the building unnoticed

91
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:43,607
<3-3,BECKETT>以为这几天不会有人
<3-3,BECKETT>Figured that the dumpster wouldn't be emptied

92
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:44,805
<3-3,BECKETT>来清理垃圾槽
<3-3,BECKETT>For a couple of days.

93
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:47,089
<3-4,ESPOSITO>他没想到7楼的一个住户
<3-4,ESPOSITO>He didn't count on a tenant on the seventh floor--

94
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,676
<3-4,ESPOSITO>一个辣妹  在扔比萨盒的时候
<3-4,ESPOSITO>A hottie-- seeing the body drop

95
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,329
<3-4,ESPOSITO>-看到尸体掉下来  -她吓坏了吗
<3-4,ESPOSITO>- As she threw out her pizza box.  - Is she distraught?

96
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:53,404
<3-5,CASTLE>我很会安慰人
<3-5,CASTLE>Because I can be very comforting.

97
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:54,526
<3-5,CASTLE>通知鉴证小组了吗
<3-5,CASTLE>C.S.U.s?

98
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,637
<3-7,ESPOSITO>-正赶过来  -周围的人没有听到枪声
<3-7,ESPOSITO>- Team's on its way.  - Neighbors didn't hear the shot.

99
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,321
<3-8,RYAN>平价消音器
<3-8,RYAN>Ah. Poor-man's silencer.

100
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,006
<3-10,ESPOSITO>他肯定是从这堆东西里找到这个
<3-10,ESPOSITO>He must have picked it up from this pile here

101
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,539
<3-10,ESPOSITO>-完事之后又扔了  -聪明
<3-10,ESPOSITO>- And then thrown it back when he was done.  - Resourceful.

102
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:05,797
<3-12,BECKETT>整齐体面的郊区居民
<3-12,BECKETT>How did a clean-cut suburban guy

103
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:06,328
<3-12,BECKETT>为何会离家这么远
<3-12,BECKETT>End up this far from home

104
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,225
<3-12,BECKETT>被杀害  然后被弃尸垃圾堆
<3-12,BECKETT>Dead and thrown out with the trash?

105
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,842
<4-1,CASTLE>好了吗  我冲啦
<4-1,CASTLE>Are you ready? Here we go.

106
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,563
<4-1,CASTLE>我知道阿丽克西斯已经跟你说过了
<4-1,CASTLE>I know Alexis already talked to you.

107
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,279
<4-1,CASTLE>我只想确认  你真的不介意她
<4-1,CASTLE>I just wanted to make sure that you're really okay

108
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,931
<4-2,BECKETT>-到这里来  -如果介意我就不会答应
<4-2,BECKETT>- With having her here?  - I wouldn't have said yes if I wasn't.

109
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,736
<4-3,CASTLE>是这样没错  但你很忙
<4-3,CASTLE>Well, yeah, but you're busy,

110
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,516
<4-3,CASTLE>我只是不想她打扰到你
<4-3,CASTLE>And I just don't want her to be in the way.

111
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,242
<4-4,BECKETT>大卡塞尔才会打扰到我
<4-4,BECKETT>Big Castle is the one who likes to get in the way.

112
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,249
<4-4,BECKETT>我很肯定小卡塞尔会很有趣
<4-4,BECKETT>I'm sure little castle will be a pleasure.

113
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,240
<4-5,ESPOSITO>萨姆·帕克  38岁
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Sam Parker, aged 38

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,454
<4-5,ESPOSITO>和妻子海伦住在康涅狄格州
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Lives in Connecticut with his wife Helen

115
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:41,728
<4-5,ESPOSITO>还有两个孩子
<4-5,ESPOSITO>And his two kids.

116
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,464
<4-6,RYAN>妻子正赶往停尸房认尸
<4-6,RYAN>Wife's en route to the morgue to I.D. the body.

117
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:45,002
<4-7,ESPOSITO>我们联系了租赁办公室
<4-7,ESPOSITO>We contacted the leasing office,

118
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,663
<4-7,ESPOSITO>住户名单上没有萨姆·帕克这个人
<4-7,ESPOSITO>And they don't have a Sam Parker listed as a tenant.

119
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:48,273
<4-8,BECKETT>那么他确实是在拜访某人
<4-8,BECKETT>So he probably was visiting someone.

120
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:50,085
<4-9,RYAN>正在调查  还没发现
<4-9,RYAN>Uniforms are canvassing. No hits yet.

121
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,825
<4-9,RYAN>鉴证科在破解指纹
<4-9,RYAN>C.S.U.'s working to untangle the prints,

122
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,624
<4-9,RYAN>但垃圾槽是公用的  可能有很多指纹
<4-9,RYAN>But since it's a common room, there's probably dozens of them.

123
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,146
<4-9,RYAN>然而  垃圾槽的把手
<4-9,RYAN>However, the chute handle,

124
00:04:56,147 --> 00:04:58,591
<4-9,RYAN>门把手和苏打瓶 都被擦干净了

<7-7,BECKETT>It's Sam Parker.

168
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,079
<7-8,SARAH REED>这全是谎言  甚至名字也是吗
<7-8,SARAH REED>It was all a lie...even his name?

169
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,808
<7-9,BECKETT>你们是怎么认识的
<7-9,BECKETT>Where did the two of you meet?

170
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,337
<7-10,SARAH REED>因为工作
<7-10,SARAH REED>At work.

171

<7-12,SARAH REED>他打来说在回城的路上
<7-12,SARAH REED>He called to say he was on his way back to the city.

<7-12,SARAH REED>他父亲在一家偏远的医院
<7-12,SARAH REED>His father is in the hospital upstate.

<7-12,SARAH REED>And Jake would drive up to see him every...

178
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,628
<7-12,SARAH REED>我太蠢了
<7-12,SARAH REED>I'm so stupid.

179
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,134
<7-12,SARAH REED>他周末是跑回去见
<7-12,SARAH REED>He was spending the weekends with...

180
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,291
<7-12,SARAH REED>他妻子
<7-12,SARAH REED>His wife.

181
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:55,913
<7-13,BECKETT>你原本今晚要和他见面
<7-13,BECKETT>So you were intending to see him tonight?

182
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:57,877
<7-14,SARAH REED>我们原本打算叫个外卖  看场电影
<7-14,SARAH REED>We were going to get takeout and watch a movie.

183
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,440
<7-14,SARAH REED>一位邻居在走廊上拦住我
<7-14,SARAH REED>A neighbor stopped me in the hallway

184
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,826
<7-14,SARAH REED>告诉我警察来过
<7-14,SARAH REED>And told me that the police had been there,

185
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,741
<7-14,SARAH REED>但我打电话去问  却没人能回答我
<7-14,SARAH REED>But when I called, nobody could tell me anything.

186
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,510
<7-14,SARAH REED>我现在知道原因了
<7-14,SARAH REED>I-I guess now I know why.

187
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,961
<7-15,BECKETT>因为他真名叫萨姆·帕克
<7-15,BECKETT>Because we I.D.him as Sam Parker."

188
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,469
<7-16,SARAH REED>太平间的工作人员
<7-16,SARAH REED>Somebody at the morgue

189
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,983
<7-16,SARAH REED>证实从他家里抬出一具尸体
<7-16,SARAH REED>Confirmed that a body had been picked up at his address,

190
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,113
<7-16,SARAH REED>所以我赶了过去
<7-16,SARAH REED>So I went down there.

191
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:17,470
<7-17,SARAH REED>当他求婚时
<7-17,SARAH REED>When he proposed,

192
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,896
<7-17,SARAH REED>我告诉好友  她并不支持我
<7-17,SARAH REED>I told my best friend, and she was all,

193
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:22,347
<7-17,SARAH REED>"你们只相识短短半年而已"
<7-17,SARAH REED>"You've only known him six months."

194
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,956
<7-17,SARAH REED>但我不在乎
<7-17,SARAH REED>But I didn't care.

195
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:28,306
<7-17,SARAH REED>他是我的真命天子
<7-17,SARAH REED>He was the one.

196
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,030
<7-17,SARAH REED>他怎么可以这样做
<7-17,SARAH REED>How could he do this?

197
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:34,064
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>这太疯狂了  这女的是谁
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>This is insane. Who is this woman?

198
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:37,489
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>萨姆绝不会  他爱我
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>Sam would never. He--he loved me.

199
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,770
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>我们的孩子是他的一切
<8-1,HELEN PARKER>Our kids meant everything to him.

200
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:40,956
<8-2,BECKETT>远不止这些
<8-2,BECKETT>Apparently there was more to it

201
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,662
<8-2,BECKETT>显然这不仅是婚外情  帕克夫人
<8-2,BECKETT>Than just the affair, Mrs. Parker.

202
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,252
<8-3,CASTLE>你丈夫在工作中使用假身份
<8-3,CASTLE>Your husband was using a false name at his job.

203
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:48,076
<8-4,HELEN PARKER>我不明白  为什么他要这样做
<8-4,HELEN PARKER>W-well, I don't understand. Why would he do that?

204
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,029
<8-5,BECKETT>我们正在调查
<8-5,BECKETT>We're still trying to figure that out.

205
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,478
<8-5,BECKETT>据了解  他因为工作关系认识里德小姐
<8-5,BECKETT>But from what we understand, he met Ms. Reed at his office.

206
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,021
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>他半年前到那里工作
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>He--he started there about six months ago.

207
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:59,787
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>他放弃了以前公司的升职机会
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>He had been passed over for promotion at his old firm.

208
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,222
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>在绿色新技术领域的工作机会不是很多
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>And there are not a lot of opportunities in green solutions,

209
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,925
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>所以即使离家很远  他还是接受了
<8-6,HELEN PARKER>So he took the job even though it was in the city.

210
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:08,535
<8-7,CASTLE>绿色新技术  是指环保意识吗
<8-7,CASTLE>Green solutions as in environmentally conscious?

211
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:10,031
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>他为公司做咨询服务
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>He did corporate consulting--

212
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:13,312
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>如何减少浪费  节约资源
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>How to reduce waste, save energy.

213
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,028
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>这是他所热衷的
<8-8,HELEN PARKER>It was a passion of his.

214
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:17,610
<8-9,CASTLE>非常令人钦佩
<8-9,CASTLE>That's very commendable.

215
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,195
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>工作回家  往返太远
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>Well, all that working and commuting

216
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,829
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>让他很疲倦  因此他找了一间廉租房
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>Were running him ragged, so he found a cheap sublet.

217
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:25,743
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>虽然艰苦  但如果困难解决了
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>It was hard, but if it all worked out,

218
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,681
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>我们也将搬到城里
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>We were gonna move down to the city

219
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,524
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>我们就能一家团聚
<8-10,HELEN PARKER>So that we could all be together.

220
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,369
<8-11,BECKETT>帕克夫人  你是否知道
<8-11,BECKETT>Mrs. Parker, did you have any idea

221
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:33,464
<8-11,BECKETT>你丈夫有婚外情
<8-11,BECKETT>That your husband was having an affair?

222
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,293
<8-11,BECKETT>我知道你在想什么
<8-11,BECKETT>I know what you're thinking.

223
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,105
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>为什么没发现蛛丝马迹
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>Why didn't I notice the signs?

224
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:41,160
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>我们育有两个孩子  没有保姆
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>We have two children together. We do not have a nanny.

225
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,928
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>所以我所有的时间
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>So every second of every minute of my day

226
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:45,544
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>都围着我的孩子
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>Is about my kids.

227
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,502
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>有事我就打他的手机
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>And if the was an issue, I'd call Sam on his cell phone,

228
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:50,982
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>他每次都接
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>And he would always answer.

229
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,928
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>我从不
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>I never...

230
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,816
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>从未想过我会在这  捍卫我的婚姻
<8-12,HELEN PARKER>Never thought I'd be sitting here justifying my marriage.

231
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,255
<9-1,CASTLE>妻子这边  是"每周电话联络"
<9-1,CASTLE>With the wife, it was "only call my cell during the week" routine.

232
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:04,744
<9-1,CASTLE>未婚妻这边  他撒谎
<9-1,CASTLE>With the fiance, he pulled out the trusty.

233
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,958
<9-1,CASTLE>"医院打电话不方便"
<9-1,CASTLE>"I can't call you from the hospital" act.

234
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,457
<9-2,RYAN>如果我一小时不打电话给女友报到
<9-2,RYAN>Man, my girl friend freaks out

235
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,737
<9-2,RYAN>她会抓狂的
<9-2,RYAN>If I don't check in, like, every hour

236
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,818
<9-3,ESPOSITO>你真的每小时报到
<9-3,ESPOSITO>You do check in, like, every hour.

237
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,125
<9-4,ESPOSITO>甚至更频繁
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Sometimes more.

238
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,390
<9-5,CASTLE>这家伙让两个女人都相信
<9-5,CASTLE>This guy had both of these women believing

239
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,491
<9-5,CASTLE>她们是他的唯一真爱
<9-5,CASTLE>That they were his one and only.

240
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,130
<9-6,BECKETT>人们相信他们愿意相信的事
<9-6,BECKETT>People believe what they wanna believe.

241
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,846
<9-7,ESPOSITO>直到真相揭开的那天
<9-7,ESPOSITO>Till the dead truth sets in.

242
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:21,916
<9-8,CASTLE>你觉得其中一个发现萨姆脚踏两条船
<9-8,CASTLE>What, you think one of them caught out what Sam was doing

243
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,794
<9-9,RYAN>当她发现并不是他的唯一
<9-9,RYAN>And didn't take too kindly when they discovered

244
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,504
<9-9,RYAN>就残忍地杀了他
<9-9,RYAN>They weren't the only woman in his life.

245
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,648
<9-10,CASTLE>我不知道  她们好像都很震惊
<9-10,CASTLE>Mm. I don't know. They seem pretty shocked to me

246
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,925
<9-10,CASTLE>没错  我也这么觉得
<9-10,CASTLE>Yeap, to me too.

247
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,390
<9-11,BECKETT>但我们得调查现有的所有事实
<9-11,BECKETT>But we gotta cover all of our bases.

248
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,467
<9-11,BECKETT>两人的不在场证明都有疑点
<9-11,BECKETT>Both of them had soft alibis.

249
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,357
<9-11,BECKETT>妻子说当孩子们在楼上睡觉时
<9-11,BECKETT>The wife said that she was watching TV

250
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:36,592
<9-11,BECKETT>她在看电视
<9-11,BECKETT>While the kids were upstairs sleeping,

251
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,733
<9-11,BECKETT>未婚妻说她独自一人在家
<9-11,BECKETT>And the fiance said that she was home alone

252
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:40,063
<9-11,BECKETT>等着见他
<9-11,BECKETT>Getting ready to meet him.

253
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:41,873
<9-12,RYAN>查查电话和账单  看有什么发现
<9-12,RYAN>We'll run phone and financials, see if anything pops.

254
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,452
<9-13,BECKETT>谢谢
<9-13,BECKETT>Thank you.

255
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,964
<9-14,RYAN>-我可以  -好的
<9-14,RYAN>- Could I run...- Right.

256
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,052
<9-16,BECKETT>你认为他会是真心的吗
<9-16,BECKETT>Do you think he'd really gone through with it?

257
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,406
<9-17,CASTLE>什么真心
<9-17,CASTLE>Through with what?

258
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,631
<9-18,BECKETT>娶莎拉  如果他没被杀
<9-18,BECKETT>Marrying Sarah, if he hadn't gotten killed.

259
00:10:51,945 --> 00:10:54,961
<9-19,CASTLE>在使用假身份的情况下还有胆量
<9-19,CASTLE>Well, that was a pretty big rock he put on her finger.

260
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,913
<9-19,CASTLE>向她求婚确实令人震惊
<9-19,CASTLE>With the fake identity he had set up,

261
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,262
<9-19,CASTLE>对一个已婚者来说
<9-19,CASTLE>The county clerk's office never would've flagged him

262
00:10:58,337 --> 00:10:59,799
<9-19,CASTLE>政府办公室是不会给他发结婚证的
<9-19,CASTLE>For someone who was already married.

263
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,723
<9-20,BECKETT>但是萨姆在认识莎拉之前  就化名杰克
<9-20,BECKETT>Yeah, but Sam was pretending to be Jake before he met Sarah.

264
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:05,184
<9-20,BECKETT>我不明白为什么要用假身份
<9-20,BECKETT>I don't understand the fake identity.

265
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,564
<9-21,CASTLE>也许要得到这工作
<9-21,CASTLE>Maybe to land the job.

266
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,518
<9-22,BECKETT>我明白要在简历上造假
<9-22,BECKETT>I understand fibbing on your resume.

267
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,948
<9-22,BECKETT>但改名换姓
<9-22,BECKETT>But changing your identity?

268
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,260
<9-22,BECKETT>这样不合理
<9-22,BECKETT>The math doesn't quite add up for me.

269
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,696
<9-23,CASTLE>我觉得什么不合理呢
<9-23,CASTLE>You know what math doesn't add up for me

270
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:13,098
<9-25,CASTLE>两个妻子
<9-25,CASTLE>Hmm. Two wives.

271
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,054
<9-26,BECKETT>-一个妻子太多  -两个太多
<9-26,BECKETT>- One wife too many for you?  - Two wives too many.

272
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,861
<9-27,CASTLE>这点不合理只是针对
<9-27,CASTLE>Seems like the common denominator in that equation

273
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,109
<9-28,BECKETT>你
<9-28,BECKETT>Is you.

274
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,752
<10-1,CASTLE>好消息
<10-1,CASTLE>Good news.

275
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,101
<10-1,CASTLE>最终我还是去听了你介绍的
<10-1,CASTLE>I'm finally embracing the lecture you gave me

276
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:37,114
<10-1,CASTLE>关于有机食物重要性的讲座
<10-1,CASTLE>On the importance of organic food.

277
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,380
<10-2,ALEXIS>你在给我做午餐吗
<10-2,ALEXIS>You made my lunch?

278
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,737
<10-3,CASTLE>我不会将你的健康交给
<10-3,CASTLE>You think I'm gonna let you risk your life on

279
00:11:40,789 --> 00:11:44,413
<10-3,CASTLE>自动贩卖机和变味的甜甜圈
<10-3,CASTLE>The vending machines and stale doughnuts of the break

280
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,354
<10-5,ALEXIS>怎样
<10-5,ALEXIS>What?

281
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:51,132
<10-6,CASTLE>你看起来  长大了
<10-6,CASTLE>You look so... Grown-up.

282
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:53,730
<10-7,ALEXIS>-真的吗  -真的
<10-7,ALEXIS>- Really?  - Really.

283
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,643
<10-9,ALEXIS>奶奶说人靠衣装
<10-9,ALEXIS>Well, gram said presentation is vital.

284
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:00,435
<10-10,CASTLE>我忘了拿手机
<10-10,CASTLE>Oh, I forgot my phone.

285
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,633
<10-12,CASTLE>你也经历过吗
<10-12,CASTLE>That ever happen to you with me?

286
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,470
<10-12,CASTLE>有天发现儿子已经长大成人了
<10-12,CASTLE>One day, you look and you see your boy is all grown-up?

287
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:10,812
<10-13,MARTHA>事实上  我还在等那一天的到来
<10-13,MARTHA>I'm still waiting for that moment, actually.

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,505
<10-14,CASTLE>是我自讨苦吃  对吧
<10-14,CASTLE>I set you up for that, didn't I?

289
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,752
<11-1,BECKETT>好  这是资料室
<11-1,BECKETT>Okay, so this is the property room. It's where

290
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,378
<11-1,BECKETT>在犯罪现场找到的物件
<11-1,BECKETT>We keep all the items that we find at a crime scene

291
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,679
<11-1,BECKETT>但却不能作为证据  存放在这里
<11-1,BECKETT>That aren't classified as evidence.

292
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:24,661
<11-2,ALEXIS>有点像失物招领处
<11-2,ALEXIS>Sort of like a lost and found?

293
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,853
<11-3,BECKETT>算是吧
<11-3,BECKETT>Um, sort of.

294
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:29,461
<11-4,ALEXIS>为什么受害者的家人不认领回去呢
<11-4,ALEXIS>Why don't the victims' families claim this stuff?

295
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,137
<11-5,BECKETT>贵重物品就有人认领
<11-5,BECKETT>Well, loved ones are aware of the big-ticket items,

296
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,654
<11-5,BECKETT>像戒指和手表
<11-5,BECKETT>Like rings and watches.

297
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:34,582
<11-5,BECKETT>但像太阳眼镜和打火机之类的
<11-5,BECKETT>But things like sunglasses and lighters,

298
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:37,426
<11-5,BECKETT>通常无人认领
<11-5,BECKETT>Those usually go unclaimed.

299
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,818
<11-6,ALEXIS>这些是案件编号吗
<11-6,ALEXIS>Are these case numbers?

300
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,477
<11-7,BECKETT>没错  所以工作就是
<11-7,BECKETT>Exactly. So the idea is to get rid of

301
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,728
<11-7,BECKETT>把这些东西处理掉  放进仓库
<11-7,BECKETT>All of this stuff and stick it into storage.

302
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:44,187
<11-7,BECKETT>在此之前  先分类
<11-7,BECKETT>But before we do that, we have to catalog it

303
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,788
<11-7,BECKETT>以防有人认领
<11-7,BECKETT>Just in case someone comes in with a claim.

304
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,217
<11-8,ALEXIS>就是需要每个物品的标签
<11-8,ALEXIS>Okay, so you need a description of every item

305
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,179
<11-8,ALEXIS>还有相应的案件编号
<11-8,ALEXIS>Along with its corresponding case number

306
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,166
<11-8,ALEXIS>输入数据库
<11-8,ALEXIS>Downloaded into the database.

307
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:53,991
<11-9,BECKETT>我知道  这跟你当志愿者的初衷
<11-9,BECKETT>And I know that this isn't exactly

308
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,018
<11-9,BECKETT>有很大出入
<11-9,BECKETT>What you were thinking of when you asked to volunteer,

309
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,022
<11-9,BECKETT>我们很缺人手  这大有帮助
<11-9,BECKETT>But we're low on manpower, and this would be very helpful.

310
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,695
<11-10,ALEXIS>别担心  这地方在我手上
<11-10,ALEXIS>Don't worry about it. This place is gonna be

311
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,513
<11-10,ALEXIS>将变得井井有条  到时你肯定认不出
<11-10,ALEXIS>So organized when I'm done, you won't even recognize

312
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,795
<11-11,BECKETT>一定是那样的
<11-11,BECKETT>I bet I won't.

313
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,818
<11-12,ALEXIS>贝克特探长
<11-12,ALEXIS>Detective Beckett.

314
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,282
<11-13,BECKETT>我爸爸有时很烦人
<11-13,BECKETT>I know my dad can sometimes be a handful.

315
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,268
<11-14,ALEXIS>"有时"  我指的是每时每刻
<11-14,ALEXIS>And by "sometimes," I mean all the time.

316
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,386
<11-14,ALEXIS>但我想你知道  别担心我
<11-14,ALEXIS>But I want to let you know don't have to worry about me.

317
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,249
<11-14,ALEXIS>我会做得很好
<11-14,ALEXIS>I'm all about getting the job done.

318
00:13:20,856 --> 00:13:22,103
<12-2,BECKETT>-贝克特  -头
<12-2,BECKETT>-Beckett.   - Sir.

319
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:26,126
<12-4,BECKETT>-怎样  -阿丽克西斯  她很好
<12-4,BECKETT>- Well? - Alexis? She's fine.

320
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,939
<12-5,CASTLE>她上幼儿园的第一天
<12-5,CASTLE>You know, her first day of preschool,

321
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:29,479
<12-5,CASTLE>我躲在外面的树丛里一整天
<12-5,CASTLE>I hid outside in the bushes all day

322
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:30,918
<12-5,CASTLE>就为了确保她没事
<12-5,CASTLE>Just to make sure she was all right.

323
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:32,505
<12-6,MONTGOMERY>我儿子第一次去夏令营
<12-6,MONTGOMERY>The first time my son went to summer camp,

324
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:34,465
<12-6,MONTGOMERY>我一路尾随那辆巴士
<12-6,MONTGOMERY>I followed the bus all the way to get around.

325
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,535
<12-7,BECKETT>你们俩不是太贴心就是太变态
<12-7,BECKETT>You two are both either very sweet or very creepy.

326
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:41,558
<12-8,ESPOSITO>楼管让我们搜了萨姆·帕克的公寓
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Super let us into Sam Parker's apartment.

327
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,719
<12-9,RYAN>杰克·霍兰的公寓
<12-9,RYAN>Jake Holland's apartment

328
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:43,709
<12-10,ESPOSITO>同一个人
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Same guy.

329
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,224
<12-11,RYAN>对  只是想让大家清晰明了
<12-11,RYAN>Yeah, just trying to keep it straight for everyone.

330
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,175
<12-12,ESPOSITO>话说回来  没有任何挣扎的痕迹
<12-12,ESPOSITO>Anyway, there was no signs of a struggle,

331
00:13:47,236 --> 00:13:48,830
<12-12,ESPOSITO>-而萨姆的袋子  -杰克的袋子
<12-12,ESPOSITO>- And Sam's bag was... - Jake's bag.

332
00:13:49,682 --> 00:13:51,878
<12-13,RYAN>自他从康涅狄格州探望家人回来时
<12-13,RYAN>Still sitting by the door from when he came home

333
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,498
<12-14,ESPOSITO>就一直放在门旁
<12-14,ESPOSITO>From visiting his family in Connecticut.

334
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,176
<12-15,RYAN>这就解释了为什么在他被杀后
<12-15,RYAN>Which explains why we found the Sam Parker wallet on him

335
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,494
<12-15,RYAN>能找到他的钱包

340
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:08,260
<12-18,CASTLE>拜托告诉我这是旧式的双面相框镶嵌
<12-18,CASTLE>Oh, please tell me that's the old double-sided picture frame gag.

<12-19,RYAN>Should they ever visit daddy in the big city.

344
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,675
<12-20,ESPOSITO>好消息是  我们在厨房的柜台上发现这个
<12-20,ESPOSITO>The big news is, we found this sitting on the kitchen counter.

345
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:19,821

<12-22,MAN>你连一块垃圾都不如
<12-22,MAN>You worthless piece of trash.

<12-22,MAN>Then my next call is to Helen.

350
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:28,272
<12-23,CASTLE>看来有人发现了萨姆的双重身份了
<12-23,CASTLE>Someone caught on to Sam's double life.

<12-25,BECKETT>德佩翠  那是他妻子的娘家姓
<12-25,BECKETT>Depetro? That's his wife's maiden name.

353
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:35,164

<12-26,ESPOSITO>Charlie is Helen's brother.

355
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:39,125
<12-27,BECKETT>他发现了萨姆的秘密
<12-27,BECKETT>He found out what Sam was up to.

356
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:41,375
<12-28,CASTLE>并决定清除垃圾
<12-28,CASTLE>And decided to take out the trash.

357
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:46,379
<13-1,BECKETT>德佩翠先生  我能明白你保护妹妹动机
<13-1,BECKETT>Mr. Depetro, I can understand the instinct of protection.

358
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,548
<13-2,CASTLE>如果我有妹妹  而她的丈夫背叛她
<13-2,CASTLE>If I had a sister and her husband was cheating on her,

359
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,176
<13-2,CASTLE>我也会想把他干掉
<13-2,CASTLE>I'd want to set him straight, too.

360
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,598
<13-3,CHARLIE DEPETRO>这不是我留言的原因
<13-3,CHARLIE DEPETRO>That's not why I left the message.

361
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:53,405
<13-4,BECKETT>你知道萨姆背叛海伦了吗
<13-4,BECKETT>Did you know that Sam was cheating on Helen?

362
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,609
<13-5,CHARLIE DEPETRO>她昨晚打电话告诉我才知道
<13-5,CHARLIE DEPETRO>Not until she called me last night.

00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:55,852
<13-5,CHARLIE DEPETRO>并告诉我他被杀了
<13-5,CHARLIE DEPETRO>And told me he'd been killed.

364
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,470
<13-6,CASTLE>那你说"我不会让你脱身"
<13-6,CASTLE>Then what did you mean when you said

365
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:59,818
<13-6,CASTLE>这话是什么意思
<13-6,CASTLE>"I won't let you get away with this"?

366
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:00,829
<13-7,CHARLIE DEPETRO>他欠我钱
<13-7,CHARLIE DEPETRO>He owed me money.

367
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,586
<13-8,CASTLE>萨姆向你借了钱
<13-8,CASTLE>So Sam borrowed money from you?

368
00:15:03,661 --> 00:15:06,696
<13-9,CHARLIE DEPETRO>两万块  说要用来还房贷
<13-9,CHARLIE DEPETRO>20 g's. He needed it to cover the mortgage.

369
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:08,790
<13-9,CHARLIE DEPETRO>但他之前已经拿房子做了抵押
<13-9,CHARLIE DEPETRO>He had already borrowed against the equity in the house.

370
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,464
<13-10,BECKETT>那他给你什么回复
<13-10,BECKETT>And what was the arrangement?

371
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:12,052
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>他说他需要几个月
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>He said he needed a couple months.

372
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,509
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>当他在城里找到一份新工作时
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>When he started the new job in the city,

373
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:14,926
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>我以为他会赚到更多钱
<13-11,CHARLIE DEPETRO>I figured he'd be making more dough.

374
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,094
<13-12,BECKETT>海伦不知道这个
<13-12,BECKETT>Helen didn't know about this?

375
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,645
<13-13,CHARLIE DEPETRO>他不想让她担心
<13-13,CHARLIE DEPETRO>He didn't want her to worry,

376
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:21,206
<13-13,CHARLIE DEPETRO>只要他把钱还我了 我答应不说出去
<13-13,CHARLIE DEPETRO>And as long as he paid me back, I said it'd be our secret.

377
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,198
<13-14,CASTLE>那他还了吗
<13-14,CASTLE>And did he pay any of it back?

378
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,518
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>没有  他总说自己的薪水更少了
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>Not a cent. He kept saying he was pulling in less money.

379
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:26,884
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>我觉得他在撒谎
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>I thought he was lying.

380
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,772
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>这份工作离家那么远  为什么要做
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>Why take the job that far from home

381
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,894
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>让海伦一个人来照顾孩子
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>And force Helen to deal with the kids on her own?

382
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,364
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>结果证明他根本不是为了家人
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>Comes out now he wasn't doing it for his family.

383
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:37,227
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>他只想瞒着我妹妹  玩婚外情
<13-15,CHARLIE DEPETRO>He wanted the freedom to cheat on my sister.

384
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,529
<14-1,RYAN>调查过哥哥的不在场证据
<14-1,RYAN>Brother's alibi checked out.

385
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:43,143
<14-1,RYAN>当萨姆或者杰克被杀时他工作到很晚
<14-1,RYAN>He was working late when Sam/Jake was shot.

386
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,506
<14-2,BECKETT>帕克收入方面有消息吗
<14-2,BECKETT>Any word on the Parkers' financials?

387
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:46,905
<14-3,RYAN>有  他们用支票还了拖欠的贷款
<14-3,RYAN>Yeah, they're a paycheck away from defaulting on their mortgage.

388
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,687
<14-4,CASTLE>萨姆大舅子说过  萨姆的新工作
<14-4,CASTLE>You know, the brother said that Sam was pulling in

389
00:15:48,752 --> 00:15:51,095
<14-4,CASTLE>薪水更少了  那如果萨姆缺钱
<14-4,CASTLE>Less money at his new job. If Sam was strapped for cash,

390
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,689
<14-4,CASTLE>为什么要辞去工作  而做薪水少的
<14-4,CASTLE>Why would he quit the job he had to take one that paid less?

391
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,464
<14-5,RYAN>他妻子不是说他放弃了升职机会吗
<14-5,RYAN>Didn't his wife say he was passed over for a promotion?

392
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:57,753
<14-5,RYAN>可能是有关自尊
<14-5,RYAN>Maybe it was a pride thing.

393
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,583
<14-6,CASTLE>对  但你要另外租房  更不用说煤气费
<14-6,CASTLE>Yeah, but you factor in the sublet not to mention gas.

394
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,173
<14-6,CASTLE>这自尊的代价可真高
<14-6,CASTLE>That's a high price to pay for pride.

395
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:05,469
<14-7,BECKETT>对  不要低估男性自尊的脆弱性
<14-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.

396
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,702
<14-8,RYAN>-这就是偏见  -不  不要
<14-8,RYAN>- Oh, see? That's just a stereo...- Don't, don't. That's--

397
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,671
<14-9,CASTLE>她在挑衅我们  好吧
<14-9,CASTLE>She is bating us, all right?

398
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,948
<14-9,CASTLE>无视她  她的女巫力量就没用了
<14-9,CASTLE>Just ignore her. She'll lose her witchy powers.

399
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:12,689
<14-10,BECKETT>想得美
<14-10,BECKETT>You wish.

400
00:16:12,736 --> 00:16:15,118
<14-10,BECKETT>走  去一趟帕克的办公室
<14-10,BECKETT>All right. Let's go off to Parker's office.

401
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:19,856
<14-11,CASTLE>丢东西了
<14-11,CASTLE>Lose something?

402
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,230
<14-12,BECKETT>在  哪里
<14-12,BECKETT>Um... Where--where, uh...

403
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,765
<14-12,BECKETT>我的扫帚在哪里
<14-12,BECKETT>Where's my broom?

404
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,413
<14-13,CASTLE>我见过
<14-13,CASTLE>I was looking.

405
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,666
<14-13,CASTLE>反正我不是那样的
<14-13,CASTLE>For the record, I did not.

406
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:33,319
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>我不太清楚  或许我该看过
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>I don't know. Maybe I should've seen it.

407
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,931
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>他的履历完美得像是假的
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>His resume was almost too good to be true--

408
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,533
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>在伯克利和斯坦福商学院时是班上的尖子
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>Top of his class at Berkeley, Stanford business school.

409
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,571
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>他要说这种谎  肯定是非常需要这工作
<15-1,LANCE CARLBERG>He must have really needed this job to lie so bad.

410
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:44,999
<15-2,CASTLE>那你想不到他撒谎的其它原因了
<15-2,CASTLE>So there's no other reason you can think of as to why he lied?

411
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,522
<15-3,LANCE CARLBERG>-想不到  -你聘请他时
<15-3,LANCE CARLBERG>- No. - When you hired him,

412
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,366
<15-4,BECKETT>你有调查过他的推荐人吗
<15-4,BECKETT>Did you look into any of his references?

413
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:50,627
<15-5,LANCE CARLBERG>当然  探长  我是亲自跟他们联系的
<15-5,LANCE CARLBERG>Of course I did, detective. I called them all myself.

414
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:53,099
<15-5,LANCE CARLBERG>只有一堆热情的推荐
<15-5,LANCE CARLBERG>And I got nothing but glowing recommendations.

415
00:16:53,165 --> 00:16:54,220
<15-6,CASTLE>推荐一个不存在的家伙
<15-6,CASTLE>For a guy who didn't exist.

416
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:57,045
<15-7,BECKETT>如果你还有的话  我想看他的履历副本
<15-7,BECKETT>I'd like to take a look at copy of his resume if you still have it.

417
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:59,386
<15-8,LANCE CARLBERG>我会让人力资源部发邮件给你
<15-8,LANCE CARLBERG>I'll have human resources e-mail it over to you.

418
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,909
<15-9,BECKETT>还有一个问题  你知道帕克先生
<15-9,BECKETT>Uh, before we go, did you know that Mr. Parker

419
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:04,216
<15-9,BECKETT>正在和你的一个员工恋爱吗
<15-9,BECKETT>Was romantically involved with one of your employees?

420
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:08,872
<15-10,LANCE CARLBERG>莎拉  知道  她是我最好的工程师之一
<15-10,LANCE CARLBERG>Sarah. Yeah, she's...one of my best engineers.

421
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,362
<15-11,CASTLE>有什么戏剧性事情吗
<15-11,CASTLE>Ever notice any drama,

422
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,232
<15-11,CASTLE>在办公室派对里醉酒打闹  之类的
<15-11,CASTLE>Drunken fighting at an office party, that sort of thing?

423
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:13,335
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>没  没有
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>No, never.

424
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,411
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>他们看上去感情相当好
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>They actually seemed like a pretty solid couple.

425
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:18,059
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>她现在肯定备受煎熬
<15-12,LANCE CARLBERG>And she must be going through hell right now.

426
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,840
<16-1,OPERATOR>抱歉  您所拨打的号码无法接通
<16-1,OPERATOR>We're sorry. The number you have reached is not in service.

429
00:17:27,223 --> 00:17:29,711
<16-3,ESPOSITO>他给的每一个推荐人都打不通
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Every single reference he gave is suddenly out of service?

430
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,052
<16-4,RYAN>据他老板所说
<16-4,RYAN>Well, according to his boss,

431
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,022
<16-4,RYAN>这些号码半年前都能打通
<16-4,RYAN>They were all up and running six months ago?

432
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,448
<16-5,CASTLE>那么是谁接的那些电话
<16-5,CASTLE>So who was answering the dummy lines?

<16-6,BECKETT>咱们得知道机主是什么人
<16-6,BECKETT>I'd like to know who they were registered to.

435
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,759
<16-6,BECKETT>好
<16-6,BECKETT>Ok.

436
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,829
<16-8,BECKETT>这家伙似乎是不择手段  想得到这工作
<16-8,BECKETT>This guy went to so pretty serious lengths to get this job.

437
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,598
<17-1,ALEXIS>这肯定有不寻常的意义
<17-1,ALEXIS>They must have amazing dental.

438
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:50,269
<17-2,CASTLE>真不知道你怎么学会这些的
<17-2,CASTLE>I don't know where you got this work ethic,

439
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,704
<17-2,CASTLE>但绝对不是因为我
<17-2,CASTLE>But it certainly was not from me.

440
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:53,820
<17-3,BECKETT>干得如何
<17-3,BECKETT>How's it going?

441
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,085
<17-4,ALEXIS>还不错  那台电脑刚开始有点问题
<17-4,ALEXIS>Pretty good. The computer was a little glitchy at first,

442
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:57,612
<17-4,ALEXIS>但那是因为没有人来升级软件
<17-4,ALEXIS>But that's because no one had run a software update

443
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,128
<17-4,ALEXIS>大概有  两年
<17-4,ALEXIS>In, like, two years.

444
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,853
<17-4,ALEXIS>还有  它中了毒  而我不得不杀毒
<17-4,ALEXIS>Plus, it picked up some viruses I had to zap.

445
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:04,243
<17-5,BECKETT>我发现让你做这工作太大材小用了
<17-5,BECKETT>I am realizing that you are way overqualified for this job.

446
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,574
<17-6,CASTLE>告诉过你她是个聪明女
<17-6,CASTLE>Told you she was a smarty.

447
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,038
<17-7,ALEXIS>但我有一个问题
<17-7,ALEXIS>But I do have one question.

448
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:08,433
<17-7,ALEXIS>像你之前所说的
<17-7,ALEXIS>Like you said before,

449
00:18:08,484 --> 00:18:10,421
<17-7,ALEXIS>这里多数东西都没什么价值
<17-7,ALEXIS>Most of the items here are pretty junky and meaningless.

450
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,628
<17-7,ALEXIS>但我找到了这个
<17-7,ALEXIS>I did find this, though.

451
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:16,056
<17-8,CASTLE>是吹牛相册
<17-8,CASTLE>Oh, it's a brag book.

452
00:18:16,057 --> 00:18:17,579
<17-8,CASTLE>就能到处跟别人夸自己的孩子了
<17-8,CASTLE>So you can brag about your kids.

453
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,501
<17-8,CASTLE>以前我钱包里有  现在用手机存了
<17-8,CASTLE>I used to have one in my wallet. Now it's on my phone.

454
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,388
<17-9,ALEXIS>有些照片很旧
<17-9,ALEXIS>Some of the pictures are really old,

455
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:22,717
<17-9,ALEXIS>像是很珍贵的
<17-9,ALEXIS>Like they're one of a kind.

456
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,726
<17-9,ALEXIS>只要它还没有贴上标签
<17-9,ALEXIS>It seems like something worth returning,

457
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,232
<17-9,ALEXIS>似是应该要物归原主
<17-9,ALEXIS>Only it wasn't tagged or anything.

458
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,377
<17-10,BECKETT>对  但问题是  没有案件编号
<17-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but the problem is, is without a case number,

459
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,323
<17-10,BECKETT>就很难找到这是哪位受害者的
<17-10,BECKETT>It's difficult to find out who the victim was

460
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,985
<17-10,BECKETT>怎样还给他家人
<17-10,BECKETT>And how to get this back to the family.

461
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,977
<17-11,ALEXIS>好吧  那就要收到贮存箱里对吗
<17-11,ALEXIS>Okay. So then it just goes in the storage box, right?

462
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,840
<17-12,BECKETT>这样好了
<17-12,BECKETT>I'll tell you what--

463
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:38,733
<17-12,BECKETT>我给你一份名单
<17-12,BECKETT>I'll give you a list

464
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,591
<17-12,BECKETT>列出所有可能负责这案子的警官
<17-12,BECKETT>Of all the detectives who possibly worked this case.

465
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,993
<17-12,BECKETT>拿这些照片给他们看  或许会有人记得
<17-12,BECKETT>Show them the pictures. Maybe it'll strike up a memory.

466
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,969
<17-13,CASTLE>-如果他们忙就不要打扰  -你在说你自己
<17-13,CASTLE>- Only don't bother them if they seem busy. - You're one to talk.

467
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:47,969
<17-15,ALEXIS>十分感谢
<17-15,ALEXIS>Thanks so much.

468
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:49,707
<17-16,BECKETT>失陪一下
<17-16,BECKETT>Excuse me.

470
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:53,801
<17-17,CASTLE>-这是什么  -爸爸
<17-17,CASTLE>- What's this? - Dad!

471
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:56,226
<17-18,ALEXIS>好  我马上过来
<17-18,ALEXIS>Okay, I'll be right there.

472
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,959
<17-19,BECKETT>未婚妻来了  她想谈谈
<17-19,BECKETT>The fiancee's here, she wants to talk.

473
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,690
<17-20,CASTLE>玩得开心
<17-20,CASTLE>Have fun.

474
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,187
<18-1,SARAH REED>在太平间时我就觉得她很眼熟
<18-1,SARAH REED>I knew she looked familiar at the morgue,

475
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:09,127
<18-1,SARAH REED>但我一开始不敢肯定
<18-1,SARAH REED>But I couldn't place it at first.

476
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:10,748
<18-2,BECKETT>你是说昨晚
<18-2,BECKETT>So you're saying that last night

477
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,445
<18-2,BECKETT>不是你第一次看见海伦·帕克
<18-2,BECKETT>Wasn't the first time you had seen Helen Parker?

478
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,760
<18-3,SARAH REED>对她的脸有些印象
<18-3,SARAH REED>Well, there was something about her face.

479
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,095
<18-3,SARAH REED>然后我就想起
<18-3,SARAH REED>And then it hit me--

480
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:18,153
<18-3,SARAH REED>几周前在杰克的公寓前我见过她
<18-3,SARAH REED>I had seen her in front of Jake's apartment a couple weeks ago.

481
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:19,449
<18-4,CASTLE>她那时候正离开大楼吗
<18-4,CASTLE>Was she leaving the building?

482
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,901
<18-5,SARAH REED>不  她坐在车里  车停在街对面
<18-5,SARAH REED>No, she was sitting in her car across the street.

483
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,757
<18-6,BECKETT>-你确定是海伦·帕克  - 我现在很确定
<18-6,BECKETT>- And you're sure it was Helen Parker? - I'm sure of it now.

484
00:19:24,804 --> 00:19:26,889
<18-7,SARAH REED>在街对面有一辆车
<18-7,SARAH REED>Positive identification

485
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,464
<18-8,CASTLE>你能确定就是她
<18-8,CASTLE>From all the way crossed the street in the car?

486
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,182
<18-9,SARAH REED>我记得是因为她当时看我的眼神
<18-9,SARAH REED>I made a note of it because the way she was staring at me

487
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:33,452
<18-9,SARAH REED>很  怪异  好像她在打量我
<18-9,SARAH REED>Was... Creepy, like she was sizing me up.

488
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:37,020
<18-10,BECKETT>里德小姐  过去的24小时对你来说
<18-10,BECKETT>Ms. Reed, the past 24 hours have been...

489
00:19:37,414 --> 00:19:39,536
<18-10,BECKETT>无法承受  至少可以这么说
<18-10,BECKETT>Overwhelming to say the least.

490
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,622
<18-11,CASTLE>在经受精神创伤后  证人的记忆
<18-11,CASTLE>It's not uncommon for witnesses' memories

491
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,260
<18-11,CASTLE>出现混乱是正常的
<18-11,CASTLE>To be confused after a traumatic event.

492
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,063
<18-12,BECKETT>我们需要绝对肯定
<18-12,BECKETT>We just need to be absolutely sure.

493
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,028
<18-13,SARAH REED>我知道自己看到什么
<18-13,SARAH REED>Look, I know what I saw.

494
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,084
<18-13,SARAH REED>她坐在一辆银色的凯雷德里
<18-13,SARAH REED>She was sitting in a silver Hybrid

495
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,852
<18-13,SARAH REED>看着大楼前方
<18-13,SARAH REED>Staring at the front of the building.

496
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:54,155
<18-14,BECKETT>跟你的未婚夫说过这事吗
<18-14,BECKETT>And did you tell your fiancé about this?

497
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,467
<18-15,SARAH REED>没有  那时候我打消了念头
<18-15,SARAH REED>No. At the time, I just dismissed it.

498
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,174
<18-15,SARAH REED>可现在...  我忍不住担心
<18-15,SARAH REED>But now... It makes me wonder

499
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:00,967
<18-15,SARAH REED>如果整件事情里我是唯一一个
<18-15,SARAH REED>If I'm the only person in the whole situation

500
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,257
<18-15,SARAH REED>浑然不知的人  会发生什么事
<18-15,SARAH REED>Who didn't know what was really going on.

501
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,057
<19-1,BECKETT>银色的凯雷德
<19-1,BECKETT>Silver Hybrid.

502
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,718
<19-2,CASTLE>海伦应该知道她丈夫的婚外情
<19-2,CASTLE>I guess Helen did know about her husband's affair.

503
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,897
<19-3,BECKETT>那就有了强烈的动机
<19-3,BECKETT>That would be a pretty strong motive.

504
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,754
<19-3,BECKETT>大老远来就因为她说了这么离谱的事
<19-3,BECKETT>You came all this way because she told you some crazy story

505
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,499
<20-1,HELEN PARKER>我把车停在了公寓外面
<20-1,HELEN PARKER>About me being parked outside the apartment?

506
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:26,569
<20-2,BECKETT>帕克太太  我们不会放过任何线索
<20-2,BECKETT>Mrs. Parker, we have to take every lead seriously.

507
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,277
<20-3,HELEN PARKER>你们想过没有  也许是她编造的
<20-3,HELEN PARKER>Did you ever think that maybe she made this up

508
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:31,050
<20-3,HELEN PARKER>为了分散对她的注意力
<20-3,HELEN PARKER>To take the attention off of herself?

509
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,876
<20-4,CASTLE>她特别提到了你的车
<20-4,CASTLE>She was specific about your car.

510
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:34,953
<20-5,HELEN PARKER>银色凯雷德  那是...  就像
<20-5,HELEN PARKER>A silver Hybrid? That's--that's like saying

511
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:37,348
<20-5,HELEN PARKER>有人穿黑色鞋子一样
<20-5,HELEN PARKER>Somebody was wearing black shoes.

512
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:39,692
<20-6,BECKETT>那也还是没能回答我们的问题
<20-6,BECKETT>That still doesn't answer the question.

513
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,342
<20-6,BECKETT>没有
<20-6,BECKETT>No.

514
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:46,297
<20-7,HELEN PARKER>萨姆在公寓的半年里
<20-7,HELEN PARKER>In the six months Sam had the apartment,

515
00:20:46,297 --> 00:20:47,730
<20-7,HELEN PARKER>我从没去过那里
<20-7,HELEN PARKER>I never went there.

516
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,851
<20-8,CASTLE>你从未放下孩子  和丈夫来个约会之夜吗
<20-8,CASTLE>You never popped down just once for a date night?

517
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:52,148
<20-8,CASTLE>从康涅狄格开车去也不是很远
<20-8,CASTLE>I mean, Connecticut's not that far a drive.

518
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:54,656
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>当你有两个不到十岁的孩子时
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>Well, when you have 2 children under the age of 10,

519
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:57,574
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>不是周末  跑去赴约几乎...
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>Popping down for date night midweek is...

520
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:00,239
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>是不可能的
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>Nearly impossible.

521
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,865
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>萨姆每周末都回家
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>Sam came home every weekend,

522
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:04,660
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>那时我就能见到他
<20-9,HELEN PARKER>And I would see him then.

523
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,602
<20-10,BECKETT>好吧  我们需要调查
<20-10,BECKETT>Okay, well, we just needed to check.

524
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,753
<20-10,BECKETT>很可能是里德小姐弄错了
<20-10,BECKETT>It's possible that Ms. Reed was mistaken.

525
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,926
<20-11,HELEN PARKER>你可曾想到  或许她才是知道
<20-11,HELEN PARKER>Did it ever occur to you that maybe she was the one

526
00:21:10,926 --> 00:21:12,732
<20-11,HELEN PARKER>他在撒谎的那个人
<20-11,HELEN PARKER>That knew he was lying?

527
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,847
<20-12,BECKETT>我们会考虑每种情况
<20-12,BECKETT>We're considering every scenario.

528
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,451
<20-13,HELEN PARKER>上个月有许多挂断的电话
<20-13,HELEN PARKER>We got a lot of hang-ups last month.

529
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,164
<20-13,HELEN PARKER>你们觉得那是巧合吗
<20-13,HELEN PARKER>Do you think that's a coincidence?

530
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,225
<20-14,BECKETT>你跟萨姆说过吗
<20-14,BECKETT>Did you tell Sam about it?

531
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,910
<20-15,HELEN PARKER>说过  他说只是电话推销员
<20-15,HELEN PARKER>I did. He said it was telemarketers.

532
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,419
<20-15,HELEN PARKER>但是  是她
<20-15,HELEN PARKER>But it--it was her.

533
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,611
<20-16,BECKETT>你如何肯定是她
<20-16,BECKETT>How can you be sure?

534
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:26,879
<20-17,HELEN PARKER>她有我们家的电话号码
<20-17,HELEN PARKER>I know she has our phone number.

535
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,889
<20-17,HELEN PARKER>萨姆被杀后她打过电话
<20-17,HELEN PARKER>She's called since Sam was killed.

536
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,136
<20-18,CASTLE>莎拉打给你的
<20-18,CASTLE>Sarah called you?

537
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:33,243
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>她问关于葬礼的细节  你能相信吗
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>She called about the funeral details. Can you believe that?

538
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:34,555
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>如果她认为能够出席葬礼
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>If she thinks she's gonna show her face here,

539
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,724
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>就大错特错了
<20-19,HELEN PARKER>She is sadly mistaken.

540
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,437
<20-20,BECKETT>莎拉只打来过一次吗
<20-20,BECKETT>Was that the only time you heard from Sarah?

541
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:40,725
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>不  她今早又打过电话  还留了可笑的留言
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>No, she--she called this morning and left some ridiculous message

542
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:43,508
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>有关她送给萨姆的东西  她想收回
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>About getting things back from Sam that she had given him,

543
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:44,893
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>不停说什么钢笔
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>And then on and on about some pen

544
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,565
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>是她祖父的
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>That had been her grandfather's.

545
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:51,567
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>我们已结婚十年零八个月
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>We were married for ten years and eight months.

546
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:53,566
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>如果她认为半年的婚外情
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>If she thinks that her 6-month affair

547
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,048
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>能和我们的婚姻相比
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>Can hold a candle to that...

548
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:58,270
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>我不会给她任何东西
<20-21,HELEN PARKER>I'm not giving her anything.

549
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,951
<21-1,CASTLE>漫长的车程
<21-1,CASTLE>That was a long drive.

550
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,099
<21-1,CASTLE>我明白为何他会在市里租了公寓
<21-1,CASTLE>I can see why he got the apartment in the city.

551
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,883
<21-2,ESPOSITO>我调查了帕克工作职位的基本情况
<21-2,ESPOSITO>So... I did some background on Parker's job situation.

552
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,206
<21-2,ESPOSITO>结论是他的前任雇主
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Turns out that his old employer,

553
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:12,064
<21-2,ESPOSITO>康涅狄格环保公司  消耗殆尽
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Connecticut Solutions, has been circling the drain.

554
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,410
<21-2,ESPOSITO>在过去几年中
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Over the last couple of years,

555
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,710
<21-2,ESPOSITO>被他的新任雇主夺去一半的市场
<21-2,ESPOSITO>They've lost half their market share to his new employer,

556
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,108
<21-2,ESPOSITO>纽约回收
<21-2,ESPOSITO>New York Recycle.

557
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:19,227
<21-3,BECKETT>听起来像萨姆离开了输的一方
<21-3,BECKETT>Sounds like Sam was abandoning a sinking ship.

558
00:22:19,227 --> 00:22:20,302
<21-4,CASTLE>加入赢的一方
<21-4,CASTLE>To join the winning team.

559
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:22,975
<21-5,ESPOSITO>想必是纽约回收有了新技术
<21-5,ESPOSITO>Supposedly New York Recycle came up with some new technology

560
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,615
<21-5,ESPOSITO>结果成了游戏主宰者
<21-5,ESPOSITO>That turned out to be a game changer.

561
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:27,489
<21-5,ESPOSITO>似乎一开始  两位总裁就已棋逢敌手
<21-5,ESPOSITO>Apparently these two C.E.O.s have been major rivals from day one.

562
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,286
<21-6,CASTLE>像比尔·盖茨和斯蒂夫·乔布斯
<21-6,CASTLE>Like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs,

563
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,084
<21-6,CASTLE>柯比和勒布朗
<21-6,CASTLE>Kobe and Lebron...

564
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,632
<21-6,CASTLE>茱丽和安妮斯顿
<21-6,CASTLE>Jolie and Aniston.

565
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:34,422
<21-7,BECKETT>明白了  竞争对手
<21-7,BECKETT>We get the picture. Rivals.

566
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:37,298
<21-8,CASTLE>是的  所以萨姆伪造了简历
<21-8,CASTLE>Yes. My point was, maybe that's why Sam fixed the resume

567
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:39,014
<21-8,CASTLE>他认为如果纽约回收知道他来自
<21-8,CASTLE>He didn't think that New York Recycle would hire him

568
00:22:39,014 --> 00:22:41,455
<21-8,CASTLE>康涅狄格环保  就不会雇用他
<21-8,CASTLE>If they knew he was from Connecticut Solutions.

569
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:43,256
<21-9,BECKETT>言之有理
<21-9,BECKETT>Well, that makes sense.

570
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:44,129
<21-10,CASTLE>谢谢
<21-10,CASTLE>Thank you.

571
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,131
<21-11,RYAN>你在开玩笑
<21-11,RYAN>You're kidding me.

572
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,314
<21-11,RYAN>谢谢  你帮了大忙
<21-11,RYAN>Uh, thank you. You've been very helpful.

573
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:50,910
<21-11,RYAN>申请调查萨姆简历上的号码
<21-11,RYAN>Hey, the warrants just came through on the numbers

574
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,572
<21-11,RYAN>还有推荐人的号码  有结果了
<21-11,RYAN>On Sam's resume? His references' phone numbers?

575
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,029
<21-11,RYAN>都是他上一个公司注册的
<21-11,RYAN>They're all billed and registered

576
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:57,045
<21-11,RYAN>账单也是寄去康涅狄格环保公司
<21-11,RYAN>To Connecticut Solutions, his old firm.

577
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,689
<21-12,BECKETT>为何他们申请这些电话
<21-12,BECKETT>Okay, why would they set up dummy phone lines

578
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:01,313
<21-12,BECKETT>提供伪造的推荐信
<21-12,BECKETT>And give phony recommendations?

579
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,807
<21-13,CASTLE>他们希望萨姆被雇用
<21-13,CASTLE>They wanted Sam to get hired.

580
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,329
<21-14,BECKETT>他并非对升职不理不睬
<21-14,BECKETT>He wasn't passed over for a promotion.

581
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:10,461
<21-14,BECKETT>他被安插在纽约回收  做商业卧底
<21-14,BECKETT>He was planted at New York Recycle as a corporate spy.

582
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:14,638
<21-14,BECKETT>很抱歉
<21-14,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

583
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:16,912
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>我得好好想想
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>I'm just trying to get my head around this idea.

584
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,809
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>他在劳动节野餐会上组织
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>I mean, this is the guy who organized the potato sack race

585
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:21,159
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>马铃薯麻袋竞赛
<22-1,LANCE CARLBERG>At the Labor Day picnic.

586
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:23,354
<22-2,BECKETT>有重要的间接证据表明
<22-2,BECKETT>Well, there's considerable circumstantial evidence

587
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:25,480
<22-2,BECKETT>他是前任雇主派来的
<22-2,BECKETT>That he was planted here by his former employer.

588
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,327
<22-2,BECKETT>只是还没有具体证据
<22-2,BECKETT>We just don't have the proof yet.

589
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,398
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>显然  没人比我更想要
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>Well, obviously, no one wants to get to the bottom of this

590
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:30,115
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>追根究底
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>More than I do.

591
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:31,794
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>我们会完全配合你们的工作
<22-3,LANCE CARLBERG>So you'll have our complete cooperation.

592
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:34,258
<22-4,CASTLE>你认为康涅狄格环保的目标是什么
<22-4,CASTLE>What do you think Connecticut Solutions was after?

593
00:23:34,258 --> 00:23:36,223
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>是我们的电池回收技术
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>It's our battery recycling technology.

594
00:23:36,223 --> 00:23:37,618
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>我确信你们都知道不应该
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>I'm sure you both know you're not supposed to dump

595
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,401
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>把电池扔进垃圾筒
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>Your batteries in with your trash.

596
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,411
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>电池需要完全处理
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>Batteries need to be disposed of properly,

597
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:43,862
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>否则  酸溶液和重金属析出...
<22-5,LANCE CARLBERG>Or else the acids and the heavy metals will leech out into--

598
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:46,783
<22-6,CASTLE>-进入地下水  -没错  正是
<22-6,CASTLE>- And get into the water table. - Exactly, yes.

599
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:50,001
<22-7,LANCE CARLBERG>问题是  储存电池废物是很昂贵的
<22-7,LANCE CARLBERG>The problem is, storing battery sludge can be quite expensive

600
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,583
<22-7,LANCE CARLBERG>但我们想到了办法循环利用
<22-7,LANCE CARLBERG>But we figured out a way to actually recycle the stuff.

601
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,585
<22-8,CASTLE>当你争取回收旧电池的合同时
<22-8,CASTLE>So when you bid on a contract to haul aw old batteries,

602
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:55,794
<22-8,CASTLE>能降低出价
<22-8,CASTLE>You can do it cheaper.

603
00:23:55,794 --> 00:23:57,540
<22-9,BECKETT>那样康涅狄格环保
<22-9,BECKETT>Which is why Connecticut Solutions

604
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,270
<22-9,BECKETT>就要分你半个市场
<22-9,BECKETT>Lost half of its market share to you.

605
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,870
<22-10,LANCE CARLBERG>说到底  是他们无力还击
<22-10,LANCE CARLBERG>The bottom line is, they can't compete.

606
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,117
<22-11,CASTLE>莎拉·里德是开发这项目的
<22-11,CASTLE>Was Sarah Reed on the team of engineers

607
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:04,172
<22-11,CASTLE>技术工程师之一吗
<22-11,CASTLE>That developed that technology?

608
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:05,355
<22-12,LANCE CARLBERG>是的  没错
<22-12,LANCE CARLBERG>Yeah, that's right.

609
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:06,985
<22-13,CASTLE>很可能因为这样  萨姆·帕克
<22-13,CASTLE>Well, that's probably why Sam Parker went out of his way

610
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:09,584
<22-13,CASTLE>故意接近她  很聪明
<22-13,CASTLE>To romance her--for access. That's pretty smart.

611
00:24:09,584 --> 00:24:11,620
<22-14,LANCE CARLBERG>请原谅  你是说他卑鄙吗
<22-14,LANCE CARLBERG>Pardon me, but don't you mean despicable?

612
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,093
<22-15,CASTLE>两者并不互斥
<22-15,CASTLE>The two aren't mutually exclusive.

613
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:14,525
<22-16,BECKETT>介意我们的信息技术组
<22-16,BECKETT>Would you mind if our forensic I.T. team

614
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,886
<22-16,BECKETT>看看莎拉和萨姆就是杰克的电脑吗
<22-16,BECKETT>Took a look at Sarah's computer and Sam's--Jake's--as well?

615
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:18,943
<22-16,BECKETT>或许能告诉我们
<22-16,BECKETT>They should be able to tell us

616
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,386
<22-16,BECKETT>是否危及了你的安全
<22-16,BECKETT>Whether your security was compromised

617
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:22,457
<22-16,BECKETT>是否私自占有了什么
<22-16,BECKETT>And whether he got a hold of anything proprietary.

618
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:23,839
<22-17,LANCE CARLBERG>我们愿全力配合
<22-17,LANCE CARLBERG>Anything we can do to help.

619
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,252
<23-1,BECKETT>好  谢谢
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

620
00:24:25,252 --> 00:24:28,133
<23-1,BECKETT>信息技术组已拿到莎拉和萨姆的电脑
<23-1,BECKETT>Forensic I.T. has taken possession Of Sarah and Sam's computers.

621
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,385
<23-2,CASTLE>公司里有很多商业秘密
<23-2,CASTLE>You know, there's a lot of corporate secrets

622
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,978
<23-2,CASTLE>派间谍去偷我能理解
<23-2,CASTLE>I could see sending a spy to steal,

623
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:33,120
<23-2,CASTLE>偷偷摸摸的  就为了电池废物
<23-2,CASTLE>But all this skulking around for some battery sludge?

624
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,516
<23-3,BECKETT>像那个人说的  这也是生意
<23-3,BECKETT>Well, like the man said, it's a business like any other.

625
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,345
<23-3,BECKETT>不论谁经营康涅狄格环保公司
<23-3,BECKETT>But whoever runs Connecticut Solutions

626
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:40,768
<23-3,BECKETT>都需要解释究竟是怎么一回事
<23-3,BECKETT>Is gonna have a hell of a lot of explaining to do.

627
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,977
<24-1,SARAH REED>是真的吗
<24-1,SARAH REED>Is it true?

628
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,831
<24-2,BECKETT>里德小姐
<24-2,BECKETT>Ms. Reed?

629
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:48,816
<24-3,SARAH REED>他们说的  是真的吗
<24-3,SARAH REED>What they're saying, is it true?

630
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,264
<24-4,BECKETT>我不能说细节
<24-4,BECKETT>Look, I can't go into details,

631
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:54,833
<24-4,BECKETT>但有证据表明杰克试图偷取信息
<24-4,BECKETT>But there's evidence that Jake was trying to steal information.

632
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:57,472
<24-5,SARAH REED>都是在做戏
<24-5,SARAH REED>Then it was all an act?

633
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,148
<24-6,CASTLE>那...  不代表他不在乎你
<24-6,CASTLE>Now that--that doesn't mean he didn't care about you.

634
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:03,885
<24-7,SARAH REED>那就是那个意思
<24-7,SARAH REED>That's exactly what it means.

635
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,388
<24-7,SARAH REED>他从没爱过我
<24-7,SARAH REED>He never loved me.

636
00:25:06,388 --> 00:25:09,108
<24-7,SARAH REED>他一直都是在利用我
<24-7,SARAH REED>He was just using me the whole time.

637
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:15,317
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>这家伙很厉害
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>This guy was good.

638
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,950
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>在他硬盘的隐藏分区里
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>He was running a secret e-mail client

639
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,240
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>运行着一台秘密电邮客户服务器
<25-1,FORENSIC IT GUY>From inside a hidden partition in his hard drive.

640
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,902
<25-2,ESPOSITO>说英语  我的搭档不太懂这个
<25-2,ESPOSITO>English? For my partner here.

641
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:24,558
<25-3,FORENSIC IT GUY>为防止有人会察觉  他设计的装置
<25-3,FORENSIC IT GUY>He set things up so that he could send emails outside

642
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,602
<25-3,FORENSIC IT GUY>以便于他向公司以外的网络发邮件
<25-3,FORENSIC IT GUY>Of the company network in case anyone ever came snooping.

643
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:27,768
<25-4,ESPOSITO>什么样的邮件
<25-4,ESPOSITO>What kind of emails?

644
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:31,424
<25-5,FORENSIC IT GUY>我解析电脑  但是这个
<25-5,FORENSIC IT GUY>I speak computer. This however...

645
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:33,356
<25-5,FORENSIC IT GUY>看起来像化学分子式
<25-5,FORENSIC IT GUY>Looks like chemistry.

646
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:35,978
<25-6,RYAN>-他是跟特定人物联系吗  -是
<25-6,RYAN>- Was he communicating with anyone in particular? - Yeah.

647
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,675
<25-7,FORENSIC IT GUY>所有的邮件都是给同一个人的
<25-7,FORENSIC IT GUY>All these-mails were to the same guy.

648
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,711
<25-7,FORENSIC IT GUY>Aberman@conn-sol.net
<25-7,FORENSIC IT GUY>Aberman@conn-sol.net.

649
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:45,479
<26-1,ESPOSITO>安迪·伯曼
<26-1,ESPOSITO>Andy Berman.

650
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,565
<26-1,ESPOSITO>他是康涅狄格环保的总裁
<26-1,ESPOSITO>He's the C.E.O. of Connecticut Solutions.

651
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,389
<26-2,BECKETT>他肯定就是萨姆的报告对象
<26-2,BECKETT>He must have been who Sam was reporting to.

652
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,219
<26-3,RYAN>几个月前他们互通了很多电邮
<26-3,RYAN>They exchanged a bunch of e-mails a couple months ago,

653
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:53,183
<26-3,RYAN>然后到萨姆被杀前都没有联系
<26-3,RYAN>Then nothing till the night Sam was killed.

654
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:54,654
<26-4,CASTLE>最后一封说什么
<26-4,CASTLE>And what'd that one say?

655
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:57,106
<26-5,ESPOSITO>"给我打电话  我们需要谈谈"
<26-5,ESPOSITO>"Call me. We need to talk."

656
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:58,947
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>是的  这是事实
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>Okay, yes, it's true.

657
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,806
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>那个晚上萨姆发邮件给我
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>Sam emailed me the other night,

658
00:26:00,806 --> 00:26:02,122
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>-我打电话给他  -用公用电话
<27-1,ANDY BERMAN>- And I called him. - From a pay phone?

659
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:03,982
<27-3,ANDY BERMAN>在我家附近的加油站
<27-3,ANDY BERMAN>At a gas station near my house.

660
00:26:03,982 --> 00:26:05,224
<27-4,CASTLE>很像秘密间谍啊
<27-4,CASTLE>Very cloak and dagger of you.

661
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:07,129
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>他说要在市里见我
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>He said he needed to meet me in the city.

662
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:08,101
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>他说终于查到
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>He said he finally figured out

663
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,942
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>纽约回收是如何成功的
<27-5,ANDY BERMAN>How New York Recycle was pulling it off.

664
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,535
<27-6,BECKETT>那么你承认派他去卧底
<27-6,BECKETT>So you admit that you planted him there

665
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,110
<27-6,BECKETT>偷取他们的电池回收技术
<27-6,BECKETT>To steal their battery technology?

666
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,956
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>他们出价总比我们低
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>They've been underbidding us left and right,

667
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,648
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>抢走了我们的生意
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>Stealing our business.

668
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,415
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>分享他们的回收技术
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>Getting our hands on their recycling method

669
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,166
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>能让我们公司分到客观的利润
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>Was a way to level the playing field.

670
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,619
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>但他们不愿分享  所以我就给萨姆
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>They weren't gonna share it, so I offered Sam

671
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:26,214
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>一百万  只要他能掌握核心技术
<27-7,ANDY BERMAN>A $1-million payday if he could get a hold of it.

672
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:28,214
<27-8,CASTLE>等他在电话里说任务完成了
<27-8,CASTLE>And when he called and said he completed his mission,

673
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:30,114
<27-8,CASTLE>你马上赶过去
<27-8,CASTLE>You rushed right over.

674
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:33,618
<27-9,ANDY BERMAN>我和萨姆  早就算完成了
<27-9,ANDY BERMAN>The thing about Sam is, he and I had been down this road before.

675
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:36,994
<27-10,CASTLE>什么意思  他之前就告诉你得手了
<27-10,CASTLE>What do you mean? He--he'd told you he'd found it before?

676
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:40,001
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>根据他给的资料
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>I wasted hundreds of thousands on research and development

677
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:41,098
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>我在研究和开发花了无数的金钱
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>With the stuff he brought me.

678
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:43,204
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>这个化学分子式根本就不完整
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>The chemical formulas were never complete.

679
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:45,413
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>所以当工程师试图完善它
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>So when my engineers tried to fill in the blanks

680
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:46,943
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>测试它时  我们总是失败
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>And test them, we failed every time.

681
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:48,647
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>最终  我们耗尽资金
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>Finally, we ran out of money,

682
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,499
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>所以几个月前
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>So a couple of months ago,

683
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:51,186
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>我不得不和萨姆切断联系
<27-11,ANDY BERMAN>I had to cut Sam loose.

684
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,299
<27-12,BECKETT>既然萨姆不再为你工作
<27-12,BECKETT>If Sam wasn't working for you,

685
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,692
<27-12,BECKETT>他在电话里说了什么
<27-12,BECKETT>What was he calling about?

686
00:26:54,692 --> 00:26:56,307
<27-13,ANDY BERMAN>他说要给我看点东西
<27-13,ANDY BERMAN>He said he needed to show me something.

687
00:26:56,307 --> 00:26:57,900
<27-14,BECKETT>-是什么  -我不知道
<27-14,BECKETT>- What?- I don't know.

688
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,874
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>我驾车到市区他的公寓见面
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>I drove into the city to meet him at his apartment,

689
00:26:59,874 --> 00:27:01,049
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>但我停车之后
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>But as I pulled up,

690
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,519
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>就看到门口有许多警察
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>There were cops all over the entrance.

691
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:04,274
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>我感觉不妙
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>I got a bad feeling about it,

692
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,510
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>所以我转身离开  驱车回家
<27-15,ANDY BERMAN>So I turned around and I drove home.

693
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:10,403
<27-16,BECKETT>非常有趣的故事  伯曼先生
<27-16,BECKETT>That's very interesting story, Mr. Berman.

694
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,349
<27-16,BECKETT>但我有个不同的结尾
<27-16,BECKETT>But I have a different ending--

695
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:15,129
<27-16,BECKETT>你上楼走到萨姆的公寓
<27-16,BECKETT>One where you went upstairs to Sam's apartment

696
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:19,245
<27-16,BECKETT>他告诉你终于找到了正确的分子式
<27-16,BECKETT>And he told you that he finally found the real thing.

697
00:27:19,245 --> 00:27:20,790
<27-16,BECKETT>于是你对自己说
<27-16,BECKETT>You said so yourself.

698
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:23,645
<27-16,BECKETT>你的公司已经无力支付他一百万美元
<27-16,BECKETT>Your company didn't have the $1 million to pay him.

699
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,415
<27-16,BECKETT>那么你能做的事只有一件
<27-16,BECKETT>So you did the one thing that you could.

700
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,483
<27-16,BECKETT>杀了他再偷走分子式
<27-16,BECKETT>You killed him and you stole it

701
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,740
<27-16,BECKETT>只有孤注一掷才能拯救衰败的公司
<27-16,BECKETT>In a desperate attempt to save your sinking company.

702
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:38,781
<27-17,ANDY BERMAN>我要求打电话给我的律师
<27-17,ANDY BERMAN>I would like to call my lawyer now, please.

703
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:42,863
<28-1,CASTLE>你编故事的方式  相当漂亮
<28-1,CASTLE>That was pretty cool, the way you filled in the story there.

704
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,519
<28-1,CASTLE>我可能还比不上你
<28-1,CASTLE>I think I must be rather off on you.

705
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,494
<28-1,CASTLE>比我想的还要黑暗
<28-1,CASTLE>That sounded dirtier than I meant it.

706
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:48,084
<28-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<28-1,CASTLE>Hey Beckett.

707
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,146

<28-3,CASTLE>Speaking of dirty...

<28-4,RYAN>Before they're taken in for booking.

712
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,811
<28-5,BECKETT>找我  为什么
<28-5,BECKETT>For me, why?

713
00:28:01,188 --> 00:28:02,173
<28-5,BECKETT>不是吧

<29-2,SARAH REED>里德小姐

00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:26,300
<29-3,BECKETT>你在帕克的办公室干嘛
<29-3,BECKETT>What were you doing in the parkers' office?

728
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,876
<29-4,SARAH REED>她不把钢笔还我
<29-4,SARAH REED>She wouldn't give me back my pen.

729
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:30,330
<29-5,CASTLE>-你的钢笔  -我的祖父留下的
<29-5,CASTLE>- Your pen?  - My grandfather's fountain pen.

730
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,396
<29-6,SARAH REED>我把它给了杰克
<29-6,SARAH REED>I gave it to Jake wh--

731
00:28:31,397 --> 00:28:33,175
<29-7,HELEN PARKER>萨姆  他的名字叫萨姆
<29-7,HELEN PARKER>Sam! His name was Sam!

732
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:35,653
<29-8,SARAH REED>给他的时候  不知道他是个骗子
<29-8,SARAH REED>I gave it to him before I knew he was a lying sack.

733
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:36,805
<29-8,SARAH REED>然后她就不还我了
<29-8,SARAH REED>And she wouldn't give it back to me.

734
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,945
<29-9,HELEN PARKER>我就在办公室里找  那什么也没有
<29-9,HELEN PARKER>I looked for it in the office. There was nothing there.

735
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:40,530
<29-9,HELEN PARKER>我根本不知道她在说什么
<29-9,HELEN PARKER>I have no idea what she's talking about.

736
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,102
<29-10,SARAH REED>是吗  那这是什么
<29-10,SARAH REED>Oh, really? Huh. Well, then what do you call this?

737
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,305
<29-11,CASTLE>那在办公室吗
<29-11,CASTLE>That was in the office?

738
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:47,856
<29-12,SARAH REED>是的  就在抽屉里
<29-12,SARAH REED>Yes. It was right there in the drawer.

739
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,168
<29-12,SARAH REED>我不知道她怎么会忘记
<29-12,SARAH REED>How she could've missed it, I don't know.

740
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,072
<29-12,SARAH REED>除非她在撒谎  而且从来没找过
<29-12,SARAH REED>Unless, of course, she was lying and never bothered to look.

741
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,482
<29-13,BECKETT>里德小姐  我理解你的感受
<29-13,BECKETT>Ms. Reed, I understand how you're feeling,

742
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:54,073

<29-14,SARAH REED>No, this is my grandfather's pen.

744
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,738
<29-14,SARAH REED>早知如此我绝不会送给杰克
<29-14,SARAH REED>I never would've given it to Jake if I had known.

745
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,436
<29-15,CASTLE>女士们  我们能否先将
<29-15,CASTLE>Ladies, I'm wondering If maybe we can put

746
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:02,602
<29-15,CASTLE>这惹人厌的插曲放在一旁
<29-15,CASTLE>This whole nasty episode behind us.

747
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:05,632
<29-16,HELEN PARKER>她闯入我家  谁知道她还偷了什么
<29-16,HELEN PARKER>She broke into my house. God knows what else she stole.

748
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:07,796
<29-17,BECKETT>介意看下你的包吗
<29-17,BECKETT>Do you mind if I take a look at the purse?

749
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:09,105
<29-18,SARAH REED>没问题
<29-18,SARAH REED>Not at all.

750
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,716
<29-19,SARAH REED>高兴了
<29-19,SARAH REED>Happy now?

751
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,456
<29-20,BECKETT>可以了吗  这事就算过去了
<29-20,BECKETT>Is everyone okay? Can we all just walk away?

752
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,336
<29-21,HELEN PARKER>如果再让我看到你
<29-21,HELEN PARKER>If I ever catch your face around here

753
00:29:26,336 --> 00:29:27,370
<29-22,SARAH REED>得了吧  你就大声喊出来
<29-22,SARAH REED>For crying out loud, give it a rest!

754
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,400
<29-22,SARAH REED>怪不得他会得溃疡
<29-22,SARAH REED>No wonder the guy had an ulcer.

755
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,283
<29-22,SARAH REED>如果是我和你结婚  我也会
<29-22,SARAH REED>I would, too, if I was married to you.

756
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:29,835
<29-22,SARAH REED>溃疡
<29-22,SARAH REED>An ulcer?

757
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,734
<29-23,HELEN PARKER>你说什么  你这个疯子
<29-23,HELEN PARKER>What are you talking about, you crazy lunatic?!

758
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:35,614
<29-25,BECKETT>听着  听着  女士们
<29-25,BECKETT>Look! Look! Hello. Ladies, look!

759
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:38,945
<29-26,BECKETT>我知道你们都很生气
<29-26,BECKETT>I understand that you're both angry

760
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,156
<29-26,BECKETT>而且感觉被背叛
<29-26,BECKETT>And feeling betrayed,

761
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:42,568
<29-26,BECKETT>但互相责骂对方  有用吗
<29-26,BECKETT>But taking it out on each other. Isn't going to help.

762
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,912
<29-26,BECKETT>你们可以起诉对方
<29-26,BECKETT>So you can both press charges

763
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:45,704
<29-26,BECKETT>让情况更糟糕
<29-26,BECKETT>And make a bad thing worse

764
00:29:45,704 --> 00:29:48,024
<29-26,BECKETT>或者冷静地离开
<29-26,BECKETT>Or you can calm down and walk away.

765
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:52,294
<29-26,BECKETT>选择二是有时间限制的
<29-26,BECKETT>Option number two is a limited-time offer.

766
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,588
<30-1,ALEXIS>-爱你  -回头见
<30-1,ALEXIS>- Love you. - See ya.

767
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:13,227
<30-3,CASTLE>别说你又在休息室里睡了一晚
<30-3,CASTLE>Please tell me you did not sleep in the break room again.

768
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:14,592
<30-4,BECKETT>我回家了
<30-4,BECKETT>I went home.

769
00:30:14,592 --> 00:30:16,770
<30-4,BECKETT>只是忍不住去想昨晚那事
<30-4,BECKETT>Just can't stop thinking about that fight last night

770
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,823
<30-5,CASTLE>要是说我也是  会不那么想念我吗
<30-5,CASTLE>Ooh, would you think less of me if I said, me, too?

771
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:23,504
<30-6,BECKETT>我一直在想  莎拉离那很远
<30-6,BECKETT>I kept thinking that that was a long way for Sarah to go

772
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:24,893
<30-6,BECKETT>只是为了拿钢笔
<30-6,BECKETT>Just to pick up that pen.

773
00:30:24,893 --> 00:30:26,183
<30-6,BECKETT>还有溃疡什么的
<30-6,BECKETT>And that whole thing with the ulcers was

774
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,494
<30-7,CASTLE>我知道了  上演《绝望主妇》
<30-7,CASTLE>Oh, I know. That was a great "Desperate Housewives" moment,

775
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,525
<30-7,CASTLE>莎拉可是刺激了海伦一通
<30-7,CASTLE>The way Sarah just rubbed Helen's face in it.

776
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:34,070
<30-8,BECKETT>问题是  哪有什么溃疡
<30-8,BECKETT>The thing is, There's nothing about an ulcer.

777
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,974
<30-8,BECKETT>在蕾妮尸检报告中
<30-8,BECKETT>In Lanie's autopsy report.

778
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:37,164
<30-8,BECKETT>萨姆十分健康
<30-8,BECKETT>Sam had a clean bill of health.

779
00:30:37,164 --> 00:30:38,551
<30-9,CASTLE>那莎拉说的又是什么
<30-9,CASTLE>Then what was Sarah talking about?

780
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:40,203
<30-10,BECKETT>他们正在调查
<30-10,BECKETT>The boys are looking into it right now.

781
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:43,050
<30-10,BECKETT>但是据萨姆的日程安排来看
<30-10,BECKETT>But according to Sam's date book

782
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,979
<30-10,BECKETT>过去三周
<30-10,BECKETT>He had doctor's appointments every Tuesday

783
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,360
<30-10,BECKETT>他每周二都和医生有预约
<30-10,BECKETT>For the last three weeks.

784
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,385
<30-11,CASTLE>如果他有忧郁症的话
<30-11,CASTLE>Well, if he was being a hypochondriac about it,

785
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:49,793
<30-11,CASTLE>他们就不会马上告诉他有溃疡
<30-11,CASTLE>They would've told him right away he didn't have an ulcer.

786
00:30:49,793 --> 00:30:52,218
<30-12,BECKETT>那么他周二下午一点在干什么
<30-12,BECKETT>So what was he doing every Tuesday at 1:00 p.m.?

787
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:53,220
<30-13,CASTLE>另一个女人
<30-13,CASTLE>Another woman?

788
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,127
<30-14,ESPOSITO>医生办公室
<30-14,ESPOSITO>So the doctor's office

789
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:58,015
<30-14,ESPOSITO>没有萨姆·帕克和杰克·霍兰的病人记录
<30-14,ESPOSITO>Has no patient records for Sam Parker or Jake Holland.

790
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,755
<30-15,RYAN>已经确认萨姆用过汽车服务
<30-15,RYAN>Car service Sam was using confirmed

791
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:01,918
<30-15,RYAN>目的地是医生办公室
<30-15,RYAN>That he gave the doctor's office as his destination

792
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:02,944
<30-15,RYAN>当他安排汽车时
<30-15,RYAN>When he was scheduling the cars--oh

793
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,227
<30-15,RYAN>谢谢  艾丽斯
<30-15,RYAN>Thanks, Elise.

794
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:06,051
<30-16,RYAN>但我和司机谈过
<30-16,RYAN>But I talked to the drivers.

795
00:31:06,051 --> 00:31:09,270
<30-16,RYAN>萨姆一上车就改变了目的地
<30-16,RYAN>Sam changed the destination once they picked him up.

796
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:10,855
<30-16,RYAN>第一周他去了
<30-16,RYAN>The first week he headed out

797
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,362
<30-16,RYAN>长岛的居民区
<30-16,RYAN>To this residential address out in long island.

798
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:15,337
<30-16,RYAN>第二周去了
<30-16,RYAN>The next week he drove out to

799
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,876
<30-16,RYAN>在帕拉默斯的纽约回收加工厂
<30-16,RYAN>New York recycle's  Processing plant up in Paramus.

800
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,775
<30-16,RYAN>最后一周到纽瓦克港口
<30-16,RYAN>And then last week, he hit the port out in Newark.

801
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:23,582
<30-17,ESPOSITO>萨姆不想莎拉知道他的诡异行踪
<30-17,ESPOSITO>Sam wouldn't have wanted Sarah to get on to his 007 routine.

802
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:25,427
<30-17,ESPOSITO>也许他不告而别是去做间谍了
<30-17,ESPOSITO>So maybe he was slipping away to do his spying.

803
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,180
<30-18,BECKETT>在长岛呆了几个小时
<30-18,BECKETT>At some hours on long island?

804
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:28,296
<30-19,CASTLE>另一个女人
<30-19,CASTLE>So another woman.

805
00:31:28,296 --> 00:31:30,463
<30-20,BECKETT>她和萨姆在纽瓦克港
<30-20,BECKETT>She and Sam were

806
00:31:30,464 --> 00:31:31,798
<30-20,BECKETT>浪漫地在纽瓦克港一起散步
<30-20,BECKETT>Taking Long, romantic walks at Port Newark.

807
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:33,770
<30-21,CASTLE>为什么你不相信
<30-21,CASTLE>Why you gotta ruin the dream?

808
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,736
<30-22,BECKETT>听着  萨姆最后一刻改变目的地
<30-22,BECKETT>Listen, Sam was changing his destination last minute

809
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:37,857
<30-22,BECKETT>是因为他在隐藏什么
<30-22,BECKETT>With the car service because he was trying to hide something.

810
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:39,715
<30-22,BECKETT>我们来看看这些地址
<30-22,BECKETT>So let's look into the addresses

811
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:40,440
<30-22,BECKETT>看看他为什么
<30-22,BECKETT>And see why he

812
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,376
<30-22,BECKETT>要欺骗萨拉
<30-22,BECKETT>Felt the need to give Sarah a cover story.

813
00:31:56,577 --> 00:32:00,760
<31-1,CASTLE>州法规定每工作五小时  休息十分钟
<31-1,CASTLE>State law requires a 10-minute break every five hours.

814
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,939
<31-2,ALEXIS>谢谢  爸爸  我早想喝了
<31-2,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad. I needed this.

815
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,105
<31-3,CASTLE>资料室的调查进展如何
<31-3,CASTLE>So how goes your property room sleuthing?

816
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,700
<31-4,ALEXIS>不太顺利
<31-4,ALEXIS>Not amazing.

817
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,717
<31-5,CASTLE>贝克特给你的
<31-5,CASTLE>Oh, no. What happened to that

818
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,413
<31-5,CASTLE>警官名单查得如何了
<31-5,CASTLE>Uh, list of detectives Beckett gave you?

819
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,394
<31-6,ALEXIS>最后一个线索刚才也断了
<31-6,ALEXIS>I just hit my last dead end.

820
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:14,807
<31-7,CASTLE>更重要的是  你尝试过了
<31-7,CASTLE>Oh, well, what's important is, is that, uh, you tried.

821
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:15,962
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>我知道
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>I know.

822
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:17,840
<31-7,CASTLE>只是我真的很想把那些照片
<31-7,CASTLE>I just really wanted to get those pictures

823
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,841
<31-8,ALEXIS>还给受害者家人
<31-8,ALEXIS>Back to the victim's family.

824
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,322
<31-8,ALEXIS>如果这些是你随身携带的照片
<31-8,ALEXIS>I mean, I'd want them if they were pictures

825
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:24,279
<31-8,ALEXIS>我也希望能够找回来
<31-8,ALEXIS>That you'd carried around.

826
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,625
<31-9,CASTLE>如果你想象的画面是
<31-9,CASTLE>If you are imagining a scenario where I am

827
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:29,982
<31-9,CASTLE>我不在了  无法关注你一举一动
<31-9,CASTLE>No longer here and watching over your every move

828
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:31,610
<31-9,CASTLE>保护你免受危险
<31-9,CASTLE>And protecting you from every danger,

829
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,332
<31-9,CASTLE>那我保证  绝不可能发生
<31-9,CASTLE>I can assure you, that will never happen.

830
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,038
<31-10,ALEXIS>我刚才只是说觉得那个很重要
<31-10,ALEXIS>I'm just saying, I think it's important.

831
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,202
<31-11,CASTLE>不  你说的没错  但是记住
<31-11,CASTLE>No, you're right, but remember,

832
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:42,539
<31-11,CASTLE>这么多东西无人认领是有原因的
<31-11,CASTLE>There's a reason why a lot of this stuff goes unclaimed.

833
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,126
<31-12,ALEXIS>是啊  在我剩下的时间里
<31-12,ALEXIS>Yeah. I guess I just need to focus on cataloging

834
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:46,881
<31-12,ALEXIS>应该把注意力放在分类上
<31-12,ALEXIS>For the rest of my time here.

835
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,233
<31-13,CASTLE>在你知晓之前  就会从执法部门退休
<31-13,CASTLE>And before you know it, you'll be retired from law enforcement

836
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:50,836
<31-13,CASTLE>回到高中继续学习
<31-13,CASTLE>And back in the eleventh grade.

837
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:53,859
<31-14,ALEXIS>谢谢爸爸
<31-14,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad.

838
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:55,715
<31-15,CASTLE>为什么  不谢
<31-15,CASTLE>For what? You're welcome.

839
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,280
<31-16,ALEXIS>你给我指了条新线索
<31-16,ALEXIS>You just gave me a new lead.

840
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,329
<31-17,CASTLE>我会帮你把可可喝完的
<31-17,CASTLE>So I'll finish your cocoa.

841
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:04,436
<32-1,BECKETT>两组家庭关系
<32-1,BECKETT>Two relationships.

842
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:07,317
<32-1,BECKETT>你能想象这种压力吗
<32-1,BECKETT>Can you imagine the stress of trying to pull that off?

843
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:09,876
<32-1,BECKETT>是的
<32-1,BECKETT>Yes.

844
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,136
<32-2,CASTLE>从纯文学观点来看
<32-2,CASTLE>Uh, from a literary point of view.

845
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:15,742
<32-3,BECKETT>你们发现了什么
<32-3,BECKETT>Hey. What'd you guys find?

846
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:17,108
<32-4,RYAN>我们按照片进行调查
<32-4,RYAN>Well, we canvassed using a picture.

847
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:19,198
<32-4,RYAN>遇到纽瓦克港口的一名工作人员
<32-4,RYAN>We came up with a alongshore man in port Newark

848
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,170
<32-4,RYAN>他记得萨姆
<32-4,RYAN>Who remembered Sam.

849
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,179
<32-4,RYAN>似乎萨姆当时在询问旅客名单
<32-4,RYAN>Apparently he'd been asking about shipping manifests.

850
00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:23,422
<32-5,CASTLE>没什么可疑
<32-5,CASTLE>Sounds random.

851
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:25,371
<32-6,ESPOSITO>这个人帮不上忙  萨姆就离开了
<32-6,ESPOSITO>The longshoreman couldn't help him, so Sam moved on.

852
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,984
<32-7,BECKETT>第一个周二去的地方呢
<32-7,BECKETT>What about the address from the first Tuesday?

853
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:28,911
<32-8,RYAN>有好消息
<32-8,RYAN>Oh, here's where  gets good.

854
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:31,923
<32-8,RYAN>长岛那个地址住着一位单身母亲
<32-8,RYAN>The long island address is the residence of a single mother--

855
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:33,890
<32-8,RYAN>劳伦·布兰斯顿和六岁的女儿
<32-8,RYAN>Lauren Bramston-- and her 6-year-old daughter.

856
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,403
<32-9,CASTLE>我早就说了  是另一个女人
<32-9,CASTLE>I told you it was another woman.

857
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,647
<32-9,CASTLE>三角恋变成了四角恋
<32-9,CASTLE>Our love triangle just became a love square.

858
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:41,649
<32-10,RYAN>不  还是三角恋  换了名字但是...
<32-10,RYAN>Nope. Still a triangle. Different name, but that's...

859
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:44,731
<32-11,BECKETT>未婚妻  莎拉·里德
<32-11,BECKETT>The fiance, Sarah Reed.

860
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:48,650
<32-12,CASTLE>看起来萨姆不是唯一隐瞒身份的人
<32-12,CASTLE>Well, it looks like Sam wasn't the only one hiding his identity.

861
00:33:53,256 --> 00:33:55,439
<33-1,BECKETT>订婚  恋情
<33-1,BECKETT>The engagement,  the relationship,

862
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,134
<33-1,BECKETT>我们已经知道这是一场骗局
<33-1,BECKETT>We know they were all fake.

863
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:59,962
<33-1,BECKETT>证明爱情不存在可是很难的  贝克特探长
<33-1,BECKETT>Love is a hard thing to disprove, detective Beckett.

864
00:34:00,135 --> 00:34:03,475
<33-1,BECKETT>这是你真实驾照的复印件
<33-1,BECKETT>This is a copy of your real driver's license.

865
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,160
<33-1,BECKETT>你的社保卡
<33-1,BECKETT>And this is your social security card.

866
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:10,281
<33-1,BECKETT>一份纽约回收中心的受雇记录
<33-1,BECKETT>And this is the employment record from New York Recycle

867
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:12,587
<33-1,BECKETT>是用假身份登记的
<33-1,BECKETT>Under an assumed identity.

868
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:14,207
<33-2,LAURA BRANSTON>一点不像新起点
<33-2,LAURA BRANSTON>Nothing like a fresh start.

869
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:15,872
<33-3,CASTLE>我们还查到
<33-3,CASTLE>We did a little digging.

870
00:34:15,872 --> 00:34:17,885
<33-3,CASTLE>纽约回收中心不是第一个
<33-3,CASTLE>Turns out New York Recycle isn't the first company

871
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,602
<33-3,CASTLE>你用假身份上班的公司
<33-3,CASTLE>You've worked for under a new identity.

872
00:34:19,602 --> 00:34:21,175
<33-4,LAURA BRANSTON>我必须维持生计
<33-4,LAURA BRANSTON>A girl's gotta make a living.

873
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:24,265
<33-5,BECKETT>我是这么想的
<33-5,BECKETT>Here's what I'm thinking--

874
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:27,211
<33-5,BECKETT>兰斯·卡尔伯格发现了萨姆是个间谍
<33-5,BECKETT>Lance Carlberg figured out that Sam was a spy.

875
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:31,389
<33-5,BECKETT>他联系了你  专业的商业间谍
<33-5,BECKETT>He contacted you, an expert in corporate espionage,

876
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:32,737
<33-5,BECKETT>让你去搞定他
<33-5,BECKETT>And asked you to intercept him.

877
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,156
<33-6,LAURA BRANSTON>我只做了分内的事
<33-6,LAURA BRANSTON>I was just doing my job.

878
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,087
<33-6,LAURA BRANSTON>骗人不算犯罪  是不是  探长
<33-6,LAURA BRANSTON>Leading a man on isn't a crime, is it, detective?

879
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,123
<33-8,BECKETT>-的确不算  -我没问你骗人的事
<33-8,BECKETT>- Should be. - I'm not looking into the leading on part.

880
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,117
<33-8,BECKETT>我问的是谋杀
<33-8,BECKETT>I'm looking into a murder,

881
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:42,170
<33-8,BECKETT>你去过萨姆的公寓
<33-8,BECKETT>And you had access to Sam's apartment,

882
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,592
<33-8,BECKETT>你受雇"照顾好"他
<33-8,BECKETT>And you were hired to take care of him.

883
00:34:43,592 --> 00:34:45,639
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>我只受雇阻止他
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>I was hired to get in his way.

884
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:46,979
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>我本来应该假装已经
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>It was supposed to look like I had access

885
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:47,970
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>取得了机密信息
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>To classified information.

886
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,587
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>所以当我和他调情的时候
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>So when I struck up a flirtation,

887
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,640
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>他认为这种关系会给他机会
<33-9,LAURA BRANSTON>He thought the relationship would give him the access he needed.

888
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,319
<33-10,BECKETT>一旦你们在一起  你的计划是怎样的
<33-10,BECKETT>Once you had the relationship, what was the plan?

889
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:56,599
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>我只需偶然把笔记本电脑
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>I just had to leave my laptop

890
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:58,306
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>落在他的公寓
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>Lying around his apartment once or twice.

891
00:34:58,306 --> 00:35:01,023
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>有个周末把门卡落在了他的衣服里
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>My keycard ended up in his laundry one weekend.

892
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:02,493
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>男人都认为他们很聪明
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>Men think they're smart.

893
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:04,411
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>方法就是让他们不停地自以为是
<33-11,LAURA BRANSTON>The trick is to keep letting them think it.

894
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:09,196
<33-12,BECKETT>那么你的电脑里有什么
<33-12,BECKETT>Um... So what was on the computer?

895
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:12,210
<33-13,LAURA BRANSTON>兰斯给萨姆部分的化学式
<33-13,LAURA BRANSTON>Lance was feeding Sam these partial chemical formulas.

896
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,901
<33-13,LAURA BRANSTON>他认为这能让康涅狄格的研究毫无进展
<33-13,LAURA BRANSTON>He thought it would keep Connecticut solutions going in circles.

897
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,078
<33-14,CASTLE>为什么不甩了他
<33-14,CASTLE>Why not just fire him?

898
00:35:16,078 --> 00:35:17,895
<33-15,LAURA BRANSTON>为什么不一石二鸟
<33-15,LAURA BRANSTON>Why not kill two birds with one stone?

899
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:20,816
<33-15,LAURA BRANSTON>绊住对手  还能把康涅狄克弄得一团糟
<33-15,LAURA BRANSTON>Keep the enemy close and run Connecticut into the ground.

900
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:22,125
<33-16,CASTLE>是什么让你觉得
<33-16,CASTLE>And what makes you think

901
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,750
<33-16,CASTLE>萨姆陷入了你的圈套
<33-16,CASTLE>That Sam was falling for your routine?

902
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,348
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>开始我也疑惑
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>Well, I wondered at first,

903
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:27,173
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>因为他从不跟我上床
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>Because he wouldn't sleep with me.

904
00:35:27,173 --> 00:35:29,377
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>后来我意识到他忠于他妻子
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>And then I realized that he was being faithful to his wife.

905
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:34,137
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>就佯信了他"我很守旧"的理由
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>So I pretended to buy his whole "I'm old-fashioned" thing.

906
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:35,820
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>他以为他在耍我
<33-17,LAURA BRANSTON>He thought he was playing me.

907
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:37,409
<33-18,BECKETT>他确实
<33-18,BECKETT>He was.

908
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:40,454
<33-18,BECKETT>这是萨姆的验尸报告
<33-18,BECKETT>This is Sam's autopsy report.

909
00:35:40,646 --> 00:35:43,535
<33-19,CASTLE>萨姆没有得溃疡
<33-19,CASTLE>Hmm. Sam didn't have an ulcer.

910
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:45,364
<33-20,LAURA BRANSTON>他总是去看医生
<33-20,LAURA BRANSTON>He was seeing a doctor for it.

911
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:48,083
<33-21,CASTLE>不  这是个幌子  他耍了你
<33-21,CASTLE>No, that was just a story.  He made you.

912
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,650
<33-22,LAURA BRANSTON>不可能  如果他骗我  我能看得出来
<33-22,LAURA BRANSTON>No way. I would've been able to tell.

913
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,037
<33-23,CASTLE>我不想打破你化名的美好愿望
<33-23,CASTLE>Oh, I hate to burst this little "alias" bubble you got going on,

914
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:56,464
<33-23,CASTLE>但是萨姆找到了你在长岛的房子
<33-23,CASTLE>But Sam found your house in Long Island.

915
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:59,619
<33-23,CASTLE>他早就知道你不只是个轻浮的工程师
<33-23,CASTLE>He knew you were more than just a flirty engineer.

916
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,458
<33-24,BECKETT>为了不引起你的猜疑  他演了好久的戏
<33-24,BECKETT>He played along not to arouse suspicion,

917
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,683
<33-24,BECKETT>但我想你已经知道了吧
<33-24,BECKETT>But I think you already knew that.

918
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,626
<33-24,BECKETT>你知道他是在玩你  而他
<33-24,BECKETT>You knew that he made you and that he found

919
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:08,200
<33-24,BECKETT>发现了秘密方法  所以你杀了他
<33-24,BECKETT>The secret method, and that's why you killed him.

920
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,208
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>我想这听起来像是
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>I think that sounds like a...

921
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:16,770
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>一个精彩谍中谍故事  但是有个问题
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>Great spy versus spy story, But there is one problem.

922
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,601
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>萨姆被杀那晚  我在女儿的独奏会上
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>The night Sam was killed, I was at my daughter's recital,

923
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:22,314
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>约二十名家长能够证明
<33-25,LAURA BRANSTON>And there's about 20 other parents that can vouch for that.

924
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,951
<34-1,CASTLE>我喜欢她  她适合当凶手
<34-1,CASTLE>I like her... For the murder.

925
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,120
<34-1,CASTLE>你看到她疯子般的眼神了吧
<34-1,CASTLE>You see that crazy look in her eye?

926
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,922
<34-1,CASTLE>那是疯狂杀手的眼神
<34-1,CASTLE>That's crazy-killer look.

927
00:36:31,382 --> 00:36:33,441
<34-2,ESPOSITO>莎拉的不在场证明证实了
<34-2,ESPOSITO>Yo,  Sarah's alibi checks out.

928
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,890
<34-2,ESPOSITO>凶案发生时
<34-2,ESPOSITO>Dance teacher puts her in the front row

929
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,802
<34-2,ESPOSITO>舞蹈老师请她坐在前排
<34-2,ESPOSITO>At the time of the murder.

930
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,304
<34-3,CASTLE>她还是那副疯狂的眼神
<34-3,CASTLE>She's still got crazy eyes.

931
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:38,920
<34-4,BECKETT>他从没爱过她  她也从没爱过他
<34-4,BECKETT>He never loved her, she never loved him,

932
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,721
<34-4,BECKETT>而他们都以为在玩弄对方
<34-4,BECKETT>And they both thought that they were playing each other.

933
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:42,200
<34-5,RYAN>这还是不能说明谁是凶手
<34-5,RYAN>Which still doesn't explain who killed him.

934
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,681
<34-6,BECKETT>我们忽略了什么
<34-6,BECKETT>We're missing something.

935
00:36:44,261 --> 00:36:45,414
<34-7,CASTLE>那支笔
<34-7,CASTLE>The pen.

936
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,787
<34-7,CASTLE>如果莎拉跟萨姆的感情是假的
<34-7,CASTLE>If Sarah's relationship with Sam was a fake...

937
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:50,167
<34-8,BECKETT>她怎会把祖父的钢笔送给他
<34-8,BECKETT>Then why did she give him her grandfather's special pen?

938
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,968
<34-9,CASTLE>还有昨晚莎拉在萨姆的办公室
<34-9,CASTLE>And what was Sarah really looking for

939
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,648
<34-9,CASTLE>真正想找的东西是什么
<34-9,CASTLE>In Sam's office last night?

940
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,962
<35-1,BECKETT>什么都没有  我还是想不通
<35-1,BECKETT>Nothing. This doesn't make any sense.

941
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,131
<35-1,BECKETT>我们已经检查了莎拉的包
<35-1,BECKETT>We went through Sarah's purse.

942
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,516
<35-1,BECKETT>如果有重要东西  我们早就发现了
<35-1,BECKETT>If there was something in it, we would've found it.

943
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:09,408
<35-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在想什么
<35-1,BECKETT>Castle,  what are you doing?

944
00:37:09,408 --> 00:37:11,187
<35-2,CASTLE>我在构思一个场景
<35-2,CASTLE>I'm writing a scene.

945
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,897
<35-2,CASTLE>假设萨拉找到了要的东西
<35-2,CASTLE>Let's say Sarah found What it was she was looking for.

946
00:37:15,454 --> 00:37:16,888
<35-2,CASTLE>东西拿在手上
<35-2,CASTLE>She had it in her hand.

947
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:19,619
<35-2,CASTLE>这个时候她听到海伦进来了
<35-2,CASTLE>That's when she would've heard Helen coming out of the house.

948
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:20,827
<35-2,CASTLE>她就必须不顾一切
<35-2,CASTLE>She would've had to have

949
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:24,508
<35-2,CASTLE>避免她手里的东西被发现
<35-2,CASTLE>Gotten rid of whatever it was that she found...

950
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,180
<35-3,BECKETT>很精彩  你想构思下东西的位置吗
<35-3,BECKETT>Great. You want to write the part where we find it?

951
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,249
<35-4,CASTLE>这样海伦永远都不会知道
<35-4,CASTLE>So Helen would never know.

952
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,860
<35-4,CASTLE>你看看这是什么
<35-4,CASTLE>Ah. What do you know?

953
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,492
<35-5,CASTLE>还通着电源
<35-5,CASTLE>Power mode is still on.

954
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:49,903
<35-5,CASTLE>我们需要点胶带
<35-5,CASTLE>We're gonna need some tape.

955
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,434
<36-1,ESPOSITO>这些是死者
<36-1,ESPOSITO>These are the pics that our Vic took

956
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:54,287
<36-1,ESPOSITO>假装去看医生时拍下的
<36-1,ESPOSITO>While he was supposedly at the doctor.

957
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:56,033
<36-2,RYAN>根据纽约回收中心的说法  他们把
<36-2,RYAN>According to New York Recycle, they ship

958
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:58,492
<36-2,RYAN>电池废渣运到在帕拉默斯的回收工厂
<36-2,RYAN>Their battery sludge up to the recycling plant in Paramus.

959
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:00,169
<36-3,CASTLE>去帕拉默斯可不必乘船
<36-3,CASTLE>You don't need a boat to get to Paramus.

960
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:02,913
<36-4,MONTGOMERY>笨蛋秘方  他们没有处理废渣
<36-4,MONTGOMERY>Secret method, my ass. They weren't processing it.

961
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,184
<36-4,MONTGOMERY>他们把商标换了  然后倒掉废渣
<36-4,MONTGOMERY>They were switching labels and dumping it.

962
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,239
<37-1,CASTLE>萨姆像是艾琳·布劳克维奇[电影《永不妥协》女主角]
<37-1,CASTLE>That Sam was quite the Erin Brockovich, wasn't he?

963
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,202
<37-2,BECKETT>根本就没有回收电池的秘密方法
<37-2,BECKETT>There was no secret method to battery recycling.

964
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:16,928
<37-2,BECKETT>你们把废渣装到货物驳船上
<37-2,BECKETT>You shipped the sludge out on cargo barges

965
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,425
<37-2,BECKETT>然后倒入海中
<37-2,BECKETT>And dumped it in the ocean.

966
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,432
<37-3,CASTLE>由此省下的存储费和处理费
<37-3,CASTLE>The money you saved on storage and processing

967
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,253
<37-3,CASTLE>就进入了你的口袋
<37-3,CASTLE>You just put into your own pocket instead.

968
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:23,978
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>我知道我的权利
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>Listen, I know my rights.

969
00:38:23,978 --> 00:38:26,488
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>我什么话都不会说
<37-4,LANCE CARLBERG>And I don't have to say anything.

970
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,334
<37-5,BECKETT>你把一大批货物卖给了客户
<37-5,BECKETT>You sold a bill of goods to your customers.

971
00:38:30,334 --> 00:38:33,556
<37-5,BECKETT>你向他们保证说他们会拯救世界
<37-5,BECKETT>You promised them that they were gonna help save the world.

972
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:35,947
<37-5,BECKETT>而你为了钱  丧尽天良
<37-5,BECKETT>Instead you poisoned it for money.

973
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:37,991
<37-6,CASTLE>怎么回事  卡尔伯格
<37-6,CASTLE>What happened, Carlberg?

974
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:40,567
<37-6,CASTLE>萨姆质问你  威胁说要揭发你吗
<37-6,CASTLE>Sam confront you, threaten to ruin you?

975
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,238
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>我没有杀任何人
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>I didn't kill anyone.

976
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,829
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>你
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>And you...

977
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,581
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>你没有证据
<37-7,LANCE CARLBERG>You have no proof.

978
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:48,386
<37-8,BECKETT>事实上  我有
<37-8,BECKETT>Actually, I do.

979
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:59,714
<37-9,BECKETT>我们做了弹道测试  结果吻合
<37-9,BECKETT>We ran ballistics. It's a match.

980
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,357
<37-10,CASTLE>在你家楼外的垃圾桶里发现的
<37-10,CASTLE>We found it in the dumpster outside your apartment building.

981
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:06,001
<37-10,CASTLE>如果你把这个也回收了  也许能逃脱罪责
<37-10,CASTLE>Had you recycled, you might have gotten away with it.

982
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,098
<38-1,BECKETT>你丈夫被谋杀的当晚
<38-1,BECKETT>The night that your husband was murdered,

983
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,173
<38-1,BECKETT>他回到办公室
<38-1,BECKETT>He went back to his office

984
00:39:12,173 --> 00:39:14,633
<38-1,BECKETT>去取他收集的最后一点证据
<38-1,BECKETT>To grab the last few pieces of evidence he had collected,

985
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:17,871
<38-1,BECKETT>当时  卡尔伯格已经怀疑他了
<38-1,BECKETT>And by then, Carlberg had already become suspicious.

986
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,352
<38-2,CASTLE>当他发现你丈夫
<38-2,CASTLE>When he realized that your husband

987
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:22,210
<38-2,CASTLE>要联系旧老板请他帮忙揭露丑行时
<38-2,CASTLE>Was contacting his old boss for help in exposing his company,

988
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,863
<38-2,CASTLE>卡尔伯格想用封口费买通他
<38-2,CASTLE>Carlberg attempted to buy his silence,

989
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,002
<38-2,CASTLE>但是萨姆不买账
<38-2,CASTLE>But Sam wouldn't accept the bribe.

990
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:30,512
<38-3,HELEN PARKER>当然不会  萨姆不是那种人
<38-3,HELEN PARKER>Of course not. Not Sam.

991
00:39:30,512 --> 00:39:31,360
<38-4,BECKETT>你说环境问题
<38-4,BECKETT>You said that the environment

992
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,065
<38-4,BECKETT>是你丈夫最关心的事
<38-4,BECKETT>Was the most important thing to your husband.

993
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:34,503
<38-4,BECKETT>他为了保护环境而牺牲
<38-4,BECKETT>Well, he died trying to save it,

994
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,409
<38-4,BECKETT>我们觉得你应该知道这个
<38-4,BECKETT>And we thought that you should know that.

995
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,531
<39-2,BECKETT>谢谢
<39-2,BECKETT>Thank you.

996
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:47,835
<39-3,CASTLE>看看吧
<39-3,CASTLE>Check it out.

997
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:52,666
<39-4,CASTLE>环保局把纽约回收中心查封了
<39-4,CASTLE>The E.P.A. is shutting down New York Recycle.

999
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:01,441
<39-5,BECKETT>安娜·诺尔斯  不  我不认识
<39-5,BECKETT>Anna Noles? No, I don't know any Anna Noles.

1000

<39-7,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, send her up.

1002
00:40:05,742 --> 00:40:07,242
<39-8,CASTLE>安娜·诺尔斯是谁
<39-8,CASTLE>So who's Anna Noles?

1003
00:40:07,242 --> 00:40:09,370
<39-9,ALEXIS>我发现的照片是她妈妈的
<39-9,ALEXIS>The pictures I found belonged to her mother.

<39-10,BECKETT>是吗  你怎么发现的
<39-10,BECKETT>Really? How'd you track 'em down?

1005
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,881
<39-11,ALEXIS>是因为老爸说的那些话
<39-11,ALEXIS>It was something you said, dad,

1006
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:14,887
<39-11,ALEXIS>关于我从执法部门退休的事
<39-11,ALEXIS>About me retiring from law enforcement.

1007
00:40:14,887 --> 00:40:17,249
<39-11,ALEXIS>让我想到  要是最初查案的警官
<39-11,ALEXIS>It got me thinking, what if the officer who had

1008
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,401
<39-11,ALEXIS>退休了怎么办
<39-11,ALEXIS>Originally worked the case had since retired?

<39-12,BECKETT>你能结案让我刮目相看
<39-12,BECKETT>I'm very impressed you were able to close this case.

1011
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,594
<39-13,ALEXIS>谢谢  我知道这不如
<39-13,ALEXIS>Thank you. I-I mean, I know it's not like

1012

<39-13,ALEXIS>你做的工作重要  但是我
<39-13,ALEXIS>The important stuff you do, but I--

1013
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:31,569
<39-14,BECKETT>当一个人失去亲人
<39-14,BECKETT>You know, when a person loses someone,

1014
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,521
<39-14,BECKETT>这些是最重要的
<39-14,BECKETT>This is important.

1015
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,633
<39-15,CASTLE>我猜就是她
<39-15,CASTLE>I bet that's her.

1016
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:44,799
<39-16,BECKETT>也许你该跟她谈谈
<39-16,BECKETT>You know, maybe you should talk to her.

1017
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:53,328
