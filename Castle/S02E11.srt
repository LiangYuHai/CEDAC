<1-9,BECKETT>No, I'm not your workwife.

31
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,780
<1-10,CASTLE>我可以养条猎犬  名字就叫夏洛克[福尔摩斯]
<1-10,CASTLE>I could get a bloodhound. I could name him Sherlock,

32
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,400
<1-10,CASTLE>然后还可以它带到犯罪现场
<1-10,CASTLE>And then I could--  I could bring him to crime scenes.

33
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,360
<1-11,BECKETT>不可以
<1-11,BECKETT>No, you couldn't.

00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,440
<1-12,CASTLE>再给它带一顶小号侦探帽
<1-12,CASTLE>I could get him to wear a little Sherlock hat,

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,790
<1-12,CASTLE>训练它叼着放大镜

<1-12,CASTLE>Disapproving, judgmental-- you're totally my work-wife.

39
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,540
<1-12,CASTLE>这血迹也太明显了  但会是个好线索
<1-12,CASTLE>Oh, the blood's bold, but it works.

40
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,860
<1-13,BECKETT>不知他是否同意
<1-13,BECKETT>Not sure he'd agree.

41
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,530
<1-14,CASTLE>很明显  他  醉心艺术
<1-14,CASTLE>Well, obviously, he was-- into art.

42
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,990

<1-15,ESPOSITO>没有强行进入的痕迹
<1-15,ESPOSITO>There's no sign of forced entry.

44
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,060
<1-15,ESPOSITO>楼上的房客晚上10点14分听到枪声报警
<1-15,ESPOSITO>Tenant upstairs call in gunshots to 9-1-1 at 10:14 p.m.

45
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,630
<1-16,BECKETT>知道他为何这么晚在这吗
<1-16,BECKETT>Any idea what he was  doing here so late?

46
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,170
<1-17,ESPOSITO>不清楚  但据他助手达里斯·兰利交代
<1-17,ESPOSITO>No, but according to his assistant, Darius Langley,

47
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,760
<1-17,ESPOSITO>-他们8点就关门了  -据他所言

<1-17,ESPOSITO>墙上和仓库中的画没有丢失
<1-17,ESPOSITO>There's nothing missing off the walls or from the back.

49
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,210
<1-18,CASTLE>监控录像能看出什么吗
<1-18,CASTLE>Anything off those security cameras?

50
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,920
<1-19,ESPOSITO>-假的  没有接线  -凶手够幸运的
<1-19,ESPOSITO>- Fake. Not even hooked up. - Lucky break for the guy.

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,160
<1-21,CASTLE>除非他早知道这点  而且知道芬克会加班
<1-21,CASTLE>Unless he knew, just like he knew Fink was working late.

52
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,590
<1-22,BECKETT>或是计划好约他到这里  再问问助手
<1-22,BECKETT>Or made plans to meet him here. Check with the assistant.

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,860
<1-23,LANIE>死者与凶手搏斗过
<1-23,LANIE>He had some fight in him.

<1-23,LANIE>Abrasions on the forearms, on the hands.

55
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,690
<1-24,BECKETT>然后他从楼梯逃跑
<1-24,BECKETT>And then he made a run for the stairs.

56
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,030
<1-25,CASTLE>背后中枪
<1-25,CASTLE>Only to be shot in the back.

<1-27,ESPOSITO>Is it possible he might have been meeting somebody?

<1-28,DARIUS LANGLEY>就算他在见人  也没告诉我
<1-28,DARIUS LANGLEY>If he was meeting someone, he didn't tell me.

<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>是的  芬克先生很支持我上学
<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>Yeah, Mr. Fink totally supported me being in school.

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,930
<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>他让我提前离开去上课
<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>He'd let me leave early to make classes.

69
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,100
<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>你们打给我的时候  我也在学校
<1-34,DARIUS LANGLEY>That's where I was when you guys called.

70
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,010
<1-35,BECKETT>芬克先生有没有什么仇人
<1-35,BECKETT>Do you know if Mr. Fink had any enemies,

71
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,250
<1-35,BECKETT>相处不愉快的客户或画家
<1-35,BECKETT>Any unhappy clients or artists?

72
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,920
<1-36,DARIUS LANGLEY>没什么不寻常的
<1-36,DARIUS LANGLEY>Nothing out of the ordinary.

<1-37,BECKETT>好的  麻烦了
<1-37,BECKETT>Yes, please.

75
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,830
<1-39,RYAN>现在有个小问题
<1-39,RYAN>Hey, we got a little problem.

76
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,800
<1-41,RYAN>我们从墙上取出两颗弹头
<1-41,RYAN>We dug these two slugs out of the wall.

77
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,150
<1-42,BECKETT>还算完整  看看弹道测试
<1-42,BECKETT>They're not very fragmented. See if ballistics

78
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,440
<1-42,BECKETT>是否与其他枪击案相同
<1-42,BECKETT>Can run a match on any of the other shooting the city.

79
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,870
<1-43,RYAN>当然  但这不是问题所在
<1-43,RYAN>Sure, but that's not the problem.

80
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,180
<1-41,RYAN>我们从墙上取出这两颗弹头
<1-41,RYAN>We dug these two out of the wall,

81
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,470
<1-43,RYAN>而帕里什医生从死者身上取出另外两颗
<1-43,RYAN>And Dr. Parish has another two in our vic here.

82
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,940
<1-44,ESPOSITO>所以凶手并非神枪手
<1-44,ESPOSITO>So our perp's not a sharpshooter.

83
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,840
<1-45,RYAN>但我们只发现四颗子弹
<1-45,RYAN>But we've only found four bullets,

84
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,990
<1-45,RYAN>而地上有1  2  3  4  5块弹壳
<1-45,RYAN>And there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shell casings on the ground.

85
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,630
<1-46,CASTLE>外面也没有血迹
<1-46,CASTLE>There's no blood trail leading out of here.

86
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,480
<1-47,RYAN>正是  而且死者的血
<1-47,RYAN>Exactly, and not a drop of blood

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
<1-47,RYAN>一滴也没有溅到外面
<1-47,RYAN>Outside of the spatter from our vic here.

88
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,820
<1-48,BECKETT>那么说没有第二个死者了
<1-48,BECKETT>So there's no second victim?

89
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,060
<1-49,CASTLE>那么  第五颗子弹在哪里
<1-49,CASTLE>So where's the fifth bullet?

90
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,910
<2-1,CASTLE>那子弹是冰块做的
<2-1,CASTLE>The bullet was made of ice.

91
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,930
<2-2,BECKETT>好的  对  带她过来
<2-2,BECKETT>Okay, great. Yeah, send her up.

92
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,840
<2-2,BECKETT>芬克的妻子来了
<2-2,BECKETT>Fink's wife is on her way up.

93
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,800
<2-3,CASTLE>开枪后  子弹就融化了
<2-3,CASTLE>Fires the bullet. It melts before we can find it.

94
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,610
<2-3,CASTLE>一颗冰弹
<2-3,CASTLE>An ice bullet.

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,970
<2-3,CASTLE>喂  冰弹  你没在听吗
<2-3,CASTLE>Hello. An ice bullet, are you even paying attention to me?

96
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,300
<2-4,BECKETT>没有  你说的没一句值得听的
<2-4,BECKETT>No. You aren't saying anything worth paying attention to.

97
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,830
<2-5,ESPOSITO>伙计们还在排查
<2-5,ESPOSITO>Yo. Uniforms are still canvassing,

98
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,510
<2-5,ESPOSITO>目前  他们没在画廊外发现任何血迹
<2-5,ESPOSITO>But so far, they still haven't found any blood trails outside the gallery.

99
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,870
<2-6,RYAN>而且鉴证小组两次重新勘察现场
<2-6,RYAN>And C.S.U.'s reswept the scene twice.

100
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,960
<2-6,RYAN>还是找不到第五颗子弹
<2-6,RYAN>No sigh of our fifth bullet.

101
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,540
<2-7,CASTLE>-我说过了  冰弹  -不  老兄
<2-7,CASTLE>- I'm telling you, ice bullet. - Nah, bro.

102
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,090
<2-8,ESPOSITO>冰弹也会留下弹孔
<2-8,ESPOSITO>An ice bullet would still make a bullet hole.

103
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,910
<2-9,RYAN>-冰弹孔  -你刚才叫我什么
<2-9,RYAN>- You mean ice hole. - What'd you just call me?

104
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,120
<2-11,BECKETT>伙计们  还有什么消息
<2-11,BECKETT>Guys, what else?

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,230
<2-12,ESPOSITO>我们查了芬克的手机记录
<2-12,ESPOSITO>We checked Fink's cell phone record.

106
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,060
<2-12,ESPOSITO>晚上9点19分  他接了个电话
<2-12,ESPOSITO>He got a call at 9:19 p.m.,

107
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,770
<2-12,ESPOSITO>即遇害前一小时接到未知来电
<2-12,ESPOSITO>An hour before he was killed, from a blocked cell phone number.

108
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,430
<2-13,RYAN>通话记录表明那个电话来自纽约
<2-13,RYAN>Phone records indicate that the call originated here in New York,

109
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,580

<2-15,BECKETT>Run down Fink's client and artist list,

113
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,630
<2-15,BECKETT>看看有没有国际号码
<2-15,BECKETT>See if any of them had international numbers,

114
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,900
<2-15,BECKETT>还有别多嘴
<2-15,BECKETT>And watch your mouth.

<3-1,ANGELICA FINK>He'd sell, like, five pieces,

130
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,990
<3-1,ANGELICA FINK>他们会想知道为什么没卖六幅
<3-1,ANGELICA FINK>And they'd want to know why he didn't sell six.

131
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,740
<3-2,BECKETT>芬克太太  我知道你心烦意乱

<3-4,ANGELICA FINK>我才不想变成这样
<3-4,ANGELICA FINK>I didn't want 'em.

<3-5,CASTLE>Who would hate your husband enough

137
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,880
<3-5,CASTLE>-残忍地在他背后开枪  -罗柯
<3-5,CASTLE>- To shoot him in cold blood in the back? - Rocco.

<3-7,BECKETT>-罗柯  画家之一吗  -他的助手
<3-7,BECKETT>- Rocco? Was that one of the artists? - His assistant.

00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,370
<3-9,CASTLE>我记得达里斯是他的助手
<3-9,CASTLE>I thought Darius was his assistant.

<3-10,ANGELICA FINK>罗柯是前任  维克多几个月前炒了他

144
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,760
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>就凭罗柯  他根本算不上个男人
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>No. Rocco? He wasn't even a man.

145
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,250
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>他就像是个小跳蚤
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>He was more like a flea.

146
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,290
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>维克多根本没放在心上
<3-12,ANGELICA FINK>Victor didn't even think twice about it.

147
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,520
<4-1,CASTLE>假设小跳蚤有把枪
<4-1,CASTLE>You suppose the Flea had a gun,

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,940
<4-1,CASTLE>一把小枪和会消失的子弹

<4-2,BECKETT>Ice bullets and Fleas with guns--

<4-2,BECKETT>作家的大脑又没法思考了
<4-2,BECKETT>Do you have writer's block again?

151
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,450
<4-3,CASTLE>史蒂芬·金写的那本

<4-3,CASTLE>我觉得  不必被逻辑所局限
<4-3,CASTLE>I figure, why be limited by logic?

<4-4,BECKETT>罗柯给芬克打过恐吓电话
<4-4,BECKETT>Rocco called and left threatening messages for Fink.

<4-7,ESPOSITO>The guy got hit in the head and can't remember who he is.

161
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,290
<4-8,CASTLE>子弹消失的情节很酷  但失忆症更酷
<4-8,CASTLE>Oh, missing bullets are cool. Amnesia is even cooler.

162
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,510
<4-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>我想你肯定还有更重要的事要做
<4-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>I'm sure you have better things to do.

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,620
<5-15,CASTLE>妈妈  这样很危险
<5-15,CASTLE>Mother, that's a red flag.

<5-16,MARTHA>宝贝  你说什么也破坏不了我的兴致
<5-16,MARTHA>Honey, nothing you could say can spoil this for me.

<5-17,CASTLE>失忆症啊  现在流行

217
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,470
<5-17,CASTLE>可是显然  没这个必要了
<5-17,CASTLE>But clearly, there would be no point.

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,830
<6-2,ESPOSITO>真是疯狂  我们找到了案子的目击者

221
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,340
<6-2,ESPOSITO>但我们不知道他是谁
<6-2,ESPOSITO>We don't know who he is,

222
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,710

225
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,580
<6-4,ESPOSITO>正在带他过来
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Uniforms are bringing him in now.

226
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,290
<6-5,RYAN>弹道测试证实这颗子弹
<6-5,RYAN>Ballistics confirms the bullet

227
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,090
<6-5,RYAN>和其他子弹来自同一把枪
<6-5,RYAN>Come from the same gun as the others.

228
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,230
<6-5,RYAN>不管画廊发生了什么  他都在现场
<6-5,RYAN>Whatever happened in the gallery, he was there.

229
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,200
<6-6,BECKETT>不仅如此  凶手还想灭口
<6-6,BECKETT>Not only was he there, but someone tried to kill him as well.

230
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,540
<6-7,RYAN>-很幸运他带着书  -读的还是俄国文学
<6-7,RYAN>- Good thing he reads. - Good thing he reads Russian literature.

231
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,530
<6-7,RYAN>如果他迷尼古拉斯·斯帕克斯  就死定了
<6-7,RYAN>If the guy was a Nicolas Sparks' fan, he'd be dead.

232
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,910
<6-8,BECKETT>让鉴证小组检查外套上
<6-8,BECKETT>Have C.S.U. check the coat

233
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,030
<6-8,BECKETT>残留的火药  血迹和纤维
<6-8,BECKETT>For gunpowder residue, blood, fibers.

234
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,740
<6-8,BECKETT>或许能说明当晚的情况
<6-8,BECKETT>Maybe it can tell us what happened that night.

235
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,120
<6-8,BECKETT>查查芬克的画家和客户的身份证照片
<6-8,BECKETT>And check photo I.D.s on Fink's artists and clients.

236
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,130
<6-9,RYAN>你认为凶手是其中之一
<6-9,RYAN>You think he might be on of 'em?

237
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,420
<6-10,BECKETT>女人总是抱着幻想的
<6-10,BECKETT>A girl can dream.

238
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,730
<6-11,CASTLE>我给你拿了咖啡
<6-11,CASTLE>I brought you coffee.

239
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,310
<6-12,BECKETT>谢谢  卡塞尔
<6-12,BECKETT>Thank you, Castle.

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,350
<6-12,BECKETT>我们的记忆分为三种类型
<6-12,BECKETT>We all have three different types of memory.

241
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,220
<6-12,BECKETT>一般的知识  比如语言和事实
<6-12,BECKETT>General knowledge, like language and facts,

242
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,940
<6-12,BECKETT>这叫作语义记忆
<6-12,BECKETT>Is called semantic memory.

243
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
<6-12,BECKETT>在这部分  你完全没有问题
<6-12,BECKETT>Yours doesn't seem to be affected.

244
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,780
<6-12,BECKETT>还有程序记忆
<6-12,BECKETT>Then there's procedural memory,

245
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,160
<6-12,BECKETT>也叫肌肉记忆
<6-12,BECKETT>Also often called muscle memory.

246
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,010
<6-12,BECKETT>其中包括
<6-12,BECKETT>That includes any actions or skills

247
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,370
<6-12,BECKETT>你不断重复的行为和技巧
<6-12,BECKETT>That you've repeated over and over

248
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,180
<6-12,BECKETT>逐渐形成了神经通路
<6-12,BECKETT>And formed neural pathways for,

249
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,880
<6-12,BECKETT>比如骑自行车  这点你也没问题
<6-12,BECKETT>Like riding a bike. Now I know it is intact.

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,710
<6-12,BECKETT>因为你可以行走自如
<6-12,BECKETT>Because you've been walking around.

251
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,890
<7-1,CASTLE>所以问题是什么  医生
<7-1,CASTLE>So what's the problem, doc?

252
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,260
<7-1,CASTLE>问题在于情节性记忆
<7-1,CASTLE>The problem is in episodic memory.

253
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,350
<7-1,CASTLE>你所经历过的事
<7-1,CASTLE>That's any experience you've ever had--

254
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,730
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>对话  看过的电影
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>Conversations, movies you've seen,

255
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,920
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>认识的人  甚至你自己的名字
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>The people in your life, even your own name.

256
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,530
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>就好像  如果我是一名赌徒
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>So, like, if I were a betting man,

257
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,790
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>但却不记得自己是赌徒
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>Which I have no idea if I am,

258
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,290
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>我能赌记忆可以恢复吗
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>Would I put my money on my memory coming back?

259
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,740
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>还是不可以
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>Or not?

260
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,180
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>很难讲
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>There's no way to tell.

261
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,300
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>也许可以恢复全部记忆
<7-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>You might eventually get it all back

262
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,040
<7-3,BECKETT>也许不能  或是恢复一部分
<7-3,BECKETT>Or none of it or anything in between.

263
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,450
<7-3,BECKETT>能知道其中的原因吗
<7-3,BECKETT>Do we know why this would've happened?

264
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,610
<7-3,BECKETT>他后脑受到撞击
<7-3,BECKETT>He's got a bump on the back of his head.

265
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,150
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>头部的撞击通常伴随心理创伤
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>It's usually a blow to the head coupled with psychological trauma

266
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,420
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>导致失忆
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>Which leads to amnesia.

267
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,700
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>创伤
<7-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>Trauma?

268
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,040
<7-5,CASTLE>你确实中了枪  是这意思吗
<7-5,CASTLE>You did get shot. Could that be it?

269
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,800
<7-5,CASTLE>如果他相信他命不久矣  就会这样
<7-5,CASTLE>If he believed he was going to die, then sure.

270
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,370
<7-6,CASTLE>如果我们带他回到犯罪现场
<7-6,CASTLE>If we took him back to the scene of the crime,

271
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,590
<7-6,CASTLE>可以刺激他的记忆吗
<7-6,CASTLE>Could that jog his memory?

272
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,320
<7-6,CASTLE>有可能  但是失忆症很棘手
<7-6,CASTLE>Possibly. But amnesia's a tricky condition.

273
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,480
<7-6,CASTLE>我要带他回圣文森特
<7-6,CASTLE>I'd like to take him back to St. Vincent's,

274
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,820
<7-7,BECKETT>做一些测试和扫描  安全起见
<7-7,BECKETT>Run some tests and scans, just to be safe.

275
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,750
<7-7,BECKETT>当然  我先问一些问题
<7-7,BECKETT>Of course. I'll need to ask a few questions first.

276
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,180
<7-7,BECKETT>先生
<7-7,BECKETT>Mister...

277
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,200
<7-7,BECKETT>抱歉  我不知道怎么称呼你
<7-7,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I don't even know what to call you.

278
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,990
<7-8,JEREMY PRESWICK>我也不知道我的名字
<7-8,JEREMY PRESWICK>I don't know what to call me either.

279
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,900
<7-9,CASTLE>-你说他的程序性记忆还在  -没错
<7-9,CASTLE>- You said his procedural memory is intact.   - Yes.

280
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,990
<7-10,CASTLE>-我可以  -当然
<7-10,CASTLE>- May I?  - Sure.

281
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,060
<7-11,BECKETT>签在下面
<7-11,BECKETT>Just sign at the bottom.

282
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,170
<7-13,JEREMY PRESWICK>真奇怪  怎么回事
<7-13,JEREMY PRESWICK>That's freaky. How'd I-- how'd I do that?

283
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,800
<7-14,BECKETT>-看起来像真的签名  -可能是
<7-14,BECKETT>- That looks like a real signature. - Well, it probably is.

284
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
<7-14,BECKETT>人们多次重复签名
<7-14,BECKETT>You've signed your name so many times

285
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,810
<7-15,CASTLE>已经形成了神经通路  程序性记忆
<7-15,CASTLE>You've formed neural pathways, procedural memory.

286
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,550
<7-16,BECKETT>他不记得自己的名字  但却记得签名
<7-16,BECKETT>So he can't remember his name, but he can sign it?

287
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,300
<7-17,CASTLE>-神秘的大脑  -字迹很模糊
<7-17,CASTLE>- Mysteries of the brain.  - It's illegible.

288
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,810
<7-17,CASTLE>也许你是一名医生
<7-17,CASTLE>Maybe you're a doctor.

289
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,510
<7-18,BECKETT>第一个字好像是杰
<7-18,BECKETT>This first initial looks like a "j."

290
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,550
<7-18,BECKETT>-有印象吗  -不
<7-18,BECKETT>- Does that ring a bell?  - No. Unh-unh.

291
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,910
<7-20,CASTLE>也许我们暂时叫你杰
<7-20,CASTLE>Maybe we should just call you Jay.

292
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,020
<7-21,JEREMY PRESWICK>杰  总比没有强
<7-21,JEREMY PRESWICK>Jay. That's as good as anything, I guess.

293
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,860
<7-22,BECKETT>你认识这人吗
<7-22,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

294
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,590
<7-23,JEREMY PRESWICK>不  我应该认识吗
<7-23,JEREMY PRESWICK>No. Should I?

295
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,070
<7-24,BECKETT>他叫维克多·芬克
<7-24,BECKETT>His name is Victor Fink.

296
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,190
<7-24,BECKETT>你中枪的画廊就是他的
<7-24,BECKETT>He owned the art gallery where you were shot.

297
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,690
<7-25,JEREMY PRESWICK>他当时也在那里吗
<7-25,JEREMY PRESWICK>He was there with me?

298
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,730
<7-26,BECKETT>他被枪杀了
<7-26,BECKETT>He was shot and killed.

299
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,950
<7-27,JEREMY PRESWICK>天啊
<7-27,JEREMY PRESWICK>God.

300
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,720
<7-28,BECKETT>这个呢  罗柯·琼斯
<7-28,BECKETT>What about this man? Rocco Jones.

301
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
<7-28,BECKETT>他曾是画廊的工作人员
<7-28,BECKETT>He is the worker in gallery

302
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,680
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>各位  我很没用
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>Guys, I feel so useless.

303
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>我真的  真的很抱歉
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>Look, I'm really... I'm really sorry.

304
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,860
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>我认不出他
<7-29,JEREMY PRESWICK>I-I just don't know him.

305
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,580
<8-1,ROCCO>我为你做了这么多  芬克
<8-1,ROCCO>After all I did for you, Fink?

306
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,070
<8-1,ROCCO>我不只是你的助理
<8-1,ROCCO>I wasn't just your assistant, man.

307
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,030
<8-1,ROCCO>我为你犯法
<8-1,ROCCO>I broke the law for you.

308
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,180
<8-1,ROCCO>你以为能就这样炒了我吗
<8-1,ROCCO>And you think you can just fire me?

309
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,030
<8-1,ROCCO>我就应该杀了你  从背后崩了你
<8-1,ROCCO>I should kill you, man. Just pop you right in the back.

310
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,060
<8-1,ROCCO>砰  你就是死人一个
<8-1,ROCCO>Bang! And you're dead.

311
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,350
<8-2,ESPOSITO>你最终还是鼓起勇气杀了他  罗柯
<8-2,ESPOSITO>So you finally get the courage to do it, there, Rocco?

312
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,400
<8-3,ROCCO>老兄  我昏了头  发发脾气而已
<8-3,ROCCO>Dude, come on. I was mad. I was just blowing off steam.

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,150
<8-4,ESPOSITO>你说你为他做犯法的事
<8-4,ESPOSITO>You said you broke the law for him.

314
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,820
<8-4,ESPOSITO>怎么回事
<8-4,ESPOSITO>How?

315
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,020
<8-4,ESPOSITO>算了  伙计
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Fine by me, pal.

316
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,200
<8-4,ESPOSITO>等着上法庭吧
<8-4,ESPOSITO>You have a nice trial.

317
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,160
<8-5,ROCCO>得了  你在说什么鬼话
<8-5,ROCCO>Come on. What the hell are you talking about?

318
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,950
<8-6,ESPOSITO>你恐吓某人  然后他死了
<8-6,ESPOSITO>You threatened a guy, then he turns up dead.

319
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,860
<8-6,ESPOSITO>好好算算
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Do the math.

320
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,560
<8-7,ROCCO>造假
<8-7,ROCCO>Forgeries.

321
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,020
<8-7,ROCCO>芬克雇我帮他做高级画作的赝品
<8-7,ROCCO>Fink paid me to paint forgeries of high-end paintings.

322
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,320
<8-7,ROCCO>我挣扎过  但我需要钱
<8-7,ROCCO>Look, I was struggling, man. I needed the dough.

323
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,730
<8-8,ESPOSITO>他怎么处理赝品
<8-8,ESPOSITO>What'd he do with the copies?

324
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,910
<8-9,ROCCO>卖了
<8-9,ROCCO>Sold them.

325
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,620
<8-9,ROCCO>当成真品卖给买家
<8-9,ROCCO>Passed them along to the buyer like they were the real thing.

326
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,790
<8-10,ESPOSITO>卖给谁
<8-10,ESPOSITO>Who did he sell to?

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,210
<9-1,ESPOSITO>巴希尔·哈伦
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Bahir Harun.

328
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,550
<9-1,ESPOSITO>他是巴林领事馆的外交人员
<9-1,ESPOSITO>He's an attacher at the Bahrain consulate.

329
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,290
<9-2,BECKETT>巴林人  芬克在遇害一小时前
<9-2,BECKETT>Bahrain? So he's the one who talked to Fink

330
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,510
<9-2,BECKETT>通话的那个人
<9-2,BECKETT>An hour before he was murdered.

331
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,240
<9-2,BECKETT>也许他知道了芬克卖的是赝品
<9-2,BECKETT>Maybe he figured out Fink was selling fakes

332
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,340
<9-2,BECKETT>决定要报复
<9-2,BECKETT>And decided to get even.

333
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,440
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这都不要紧
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Doesn't matter.

334
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,530
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这家伙有完全外交豁免权
<9-3,ESPOSITO>The guy has full diplomatic immunity.

335
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,650
<9-4,BECKETT>很好
<9-4,BECKETT>Great.

336
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,060
<9-5,RYAN>我检查了芬克所有的顾客和画家的
<9-5,RYAN>So I checked all the photo I.D.s

337
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,530
<9-5,RYAN>身份证照片
<9-5,RYAN>Of all of Fink's clients and artists.

338
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,120
<9-5,RYAN>我们的朋友杰不在其中
<9-5,RYAN>Our friend Jay isn't one of them.

339
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,650
<9-6,ESPOSITO>那他当时在画廊里干什么
<9-6,ESPOSITO>Then what was he doing at the gallery?

340
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,970
<9-7,RYAN>霍洛威医生从医院来电
<9-7,RYAN>Holloway called from the hospital.

341
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,560
<9-7,RYAN>杰除了头部的小撞击  身体无恙
<9-7,RYAN>Aside from a minor head bump, Jay's got a clean bill of health.

342
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,520
<9-7,RYAN>当然  除了失忆
<9-7,RYAN>Well, other than the memory loss.

343
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
<9-8,BECKETT>你们带杰回到罪案现场
<9-8,BECKETT>You know what? Why don't you guys grab jay, take him

344
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,150
<9-8,BECKETT>看能不能刺激他的记忆恢复
<9-8,BECKETT>Down to the crime scene, see if that sparks his memory?

345
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,900
<9-8,BECKETT>联系芬克的助理达里斯
<9-8,BECKETT>And get a hold of Fink's assistant Darius.

346
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,950
<9-8,BECKETT>约他在那里见面
<9-8,BECKETT>Tell him to meet you down there

347
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,350
<9-8,BECKETT>让他带上巴希尔·哈伦的资料
<9-8,BECKETT>With every file he has on Bahir Harun.

348
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,470
<10-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>你确定我当时在这里
<10-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>And you're sure I was here?

349
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,090
<10-2,RYAN>不着急  不要有压力
<10-2,RYAN>Take your time. No pressure.

350
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,080
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>我是不是应该头疼
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>Isn't this supposed to be where I get a headache

351
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,170
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>记忆片段开始闪现
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>And flashes of memory start overwhelming me

352
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,970
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>直到所有的片段汇集一起
<10-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>Until all the pieces come together?

353
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,540
<10-4,RYAN>你电影看太多了
<10-4,RYAN>Okay, you've seen too many movies.

354
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,500
<10-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>我可不记得这个
<10-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>Yeah, that I can't remember.

355
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,080
<10-6,RYAN>就像是先有鸡  还是先有蛋
<10-6,RYAN>Wow. That's very... Chicken/egg.

356
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,710
<10-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>欢迎来到我的世界
<10-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>Welcome to my world.

357
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,340
<10-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>真诡异
<10-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>Weird...

358
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,480
<10-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>真有人能就这样失忆了
<10-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>That someone can just lose his mind like that.

359
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,190
<10-9,ESPOSITO>你确定不认识他
<10-9,ESPOSITO>Are you sure you don't recognize him?

360
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,300
<10-9,ESPOSITO>我不认识他
<10-9,ESPOSITO>I don't think so.

361
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,040
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>我在这里只做了几个月
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>But I've only been here a few months.

362
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,300
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>不过怎样  这是哈伦先生的一切资料
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>Anyway, here's everything I could find on Mr. Harun.

363
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,200
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>3年内的买画资料
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>All purchases, going back three years.

364
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,230
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>我还是不相信芬克在干造假的勾当
<10-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>I still can't believe Fink was trafficking in forgeries.

365
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,430
<11-1,ESPOSITO>哈伦从芬克那里买画
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Harun's purchases from Fink.

366
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,610
<11-2,CASTLE>数量很多
<11-2,CASTLE>That's dozens of paintings.

367
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,440
<11-3,ESPOSITO>没错  据芬克的前助理罗柯
<11-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and according to Fink's old assistant Rocco,

368
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,420
<11-3,ESPOSITO>所有的画都可能是赝品
<11-3,ESPOSITO>Any and all of these could've been forgeries.

369
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,960
<11-4,CASTLE>朱尔斯·马特森的作品  至少要10万美金
<11-4,CASTLE>This is a Jules Matterson. This is worth $100,000 easy.

370
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,420
<11-5,BECKETT>但他只给罗柯1000美金  就把他打发了
<11-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but you only pay Rocco a grand to knock it off.

371
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,200
<11-6,ESPOSITO>芬克可能为了钱干掉哈伦
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Fink could've ripped Harun off for millions.

372
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,700
<11-7,CASTLE>谁说犯罪不需要付出代价
<11-7,CASTLE>Who says crime doesn't pay?

373
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,350
<11-8,ESPOSITO>要是谁榨了我那么多钱
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Someone took me for that much,

374
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,340
<11-8,ESPOSITO>我也会在背后给他一枪
<11-8,ESPOSITO>I could see putting a bullet in his back.

375
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,350
<11-9,CASTLE>这就解释了为什么哈伦威胁芬克
<11-9,CASTLE>Well, that explains why Harun went after Fink,

376
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,990
<11-10,BECKETT>-但是杰呢  -我们得跟哈伦谈谈
<11-10,BECKETT>-But what about Jay?  -We need to talk to Harun.

377
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,500
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  我讨厌外交豁免权  也讨厌没结果
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, I hate diplomatic immunity as much as the next cop,

378
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,470
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>至于你  先把那家伙放一边
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>But as far as you're concerned, forget the guy.

379
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,850
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>我提交了会面请求
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>I put in the interview request.

380
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,580
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>现在归国务院管了  结束
<12-1,MONTGOMERY>Now it's in the state department's hands, period.

381
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,890
<12-2,BECKETT>但是长官  其他受害人怎么办
<12-2,BECKETT>Fine, but, sir, what about the other victim?

382
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,610
<12-3,MONTGOMERY>患失忆的那家伙
<12-3,MONTGOMERY>The guy with amnesia. So?

383
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,000
<12-4,BECKETT>他今晚没地方去
<12-4,BECKETT>He has nowhere to go tonight.

384
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,530
<12-5,MONTGOMERY>把他移交给社会福利处
<12-5,MONTGOMERY>Well, turn him over to social services.

385
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,840
<12-5,MONTGOMERY>是国务院的事  不是我们的
<12-5,MONTGOMERY>It's the state's problem, not ours.

386
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,250
<12-6,BECKETT>我知道  他最终可能在庇护所生活
<12-6,BECKETT>I know, sir, but he'll probably end up in a homeless shelter.

387
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,760
<12-6,BECKETT>他是涉案人员  也是潜在的人证
<12-6,BECKETT>He's a person of interest and a potential witness.

388
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,660
<12-6,BECKETT>我不想因为体制问题失去他
<12-6,BECKETT>I would hate to lose him to the system.

389
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,890
<12-6,BECKETT>那好吧
<12-6,BECKETT>Okay.

390
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,970
<12-7,MONTGOMERY>他可以睡我的沙发
<12-7,MONTGOMERY>But my couch is off-limits.

391
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,150
<12-8,BECKETT>谢谢长官
<12-8,BECKETT>Thank you, sir.

392
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,870
<13-1,RYAN>这里不是露天广场
<13-1,RYAN>It's not the plaza.

393
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,670
<13-1,RYAN>但我常溜到这里小憩
<13-1,RYAN>But I have snuck many a power nap on this couch over years

394
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,370
<13-1,RYAN>你会睡得很安稳的
<13-1,RYAN>You should sleep just fine.

395
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,750
<13-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>很感激  不用和陌生人挤在一起
<13-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>I'm grateful not to have to go anywhere with strangers.

396
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,020
<13-3,BECKETT>这不是难事
<13-3,BECKETT>It's not a problem.

397
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,790
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>想到有人想杀我  真可怕
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>It's terrifying to think that someone actually tried to kill me

398
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,730
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>我不知道凶手是谁  为什么要杀我
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>And I don't know who it was or why.

399
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,530
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>他们还逍遥法外
<13-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>And they're still out there.

400
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,710
<13-5,RYAN>所以我们要把那混蛋绳之于法
<13-5,RYAN>That's why we're gonna catch the bastard.

401
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,290
<13-6,BECKETT>但在此之前  我们要查明你的身份
<13-6,BECKETT>But to do that, we need to find out who you are.

402
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,650
<13-6,BECKETT>因此明早我们要向媒体发布你的相片
<13-6,BECKETT>So we're gonna release your photograph to the media tomorrow morning.

403
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,070
<13-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>如果没人认识我呢
<13-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>And what if nobody recognizes it?

404
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,830
<13-8,RYAN>肯定有人认识你
<13-8,RYAN>I'm sure someone will.

405
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,750
<13-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>如果没人认识  而我又不记得自己
<13-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>But what if no one does and I don't remember?

406
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,260
<13-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>那我是谁
<13-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>Then who am I?

407
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,410
<13-10,BECKETT>我向你保证  我们不会放弃你
<13-10,BECKETT>I promise you, we won't give up on you.

408
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,220
<14-1,ALEXIS>自然课老师说  巧克力所含的化学物质
<14-1,ALEXIS>My science teacher says that chocolate contains chemicals

409
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,980
<14-1,ALEXIS>已证实可以减压
<14-1,ALEXIS>That are proven to relieve depression.

410
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,420
<14-2,MARTHA>太好了  但我更喜欢葡萄酒  陈年佳酿
<14-2,MARTHA>Ah, it's good. But I prefer grape--aged, bottled and corked.

411
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,840
<14-3,CASTLE>你们在开冰激凌品尝会
<14-3,CASTLE>You're having an ice cream tasting,

412
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,720
<14-3,CASTLE>没人打电话  发短信  留言
<14-3,CASTLE>And no one called, texted or tweeted.

413
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,380
<14-4,ALEXIS>奶奶和查特分手了
<14-4,ALEXIS>Gram broke it off with Chet.

414
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,210
<14-4,ALEXIS>我建议糖治疗法
<14-4,ALEXIS>So I suggested sugar therapy.

415
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,090
<14-5,CASTLE>中心公园的日出怎样
<14-5,CASTLE>What happened to sunrise in central park?

416
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,880
<14-6,MARTHA>我在开谁玩笑  那是童话
<14-6,MARTHA>Oh, who am I kidding? It's a fairy tale.

417
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,520
<14-7,CASTLE>哪个女人不喜欢童话呢
<14-7,CASTLE>And what woman doesn't want a fairy tale?

418
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,820
<14-8,MARTHA>-他跟我想的不一样  -如何不同
<14-8,MARTHA>-He's not who I thought he was.   - How so?

419
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,410
<14-9,CASTLE>很多不同
<14-9,CASTLE>Million different little things--you know,

420
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,050
<14-10,MARTHA>他不开车  很瘦
<14-10,MARTHA>He doesn't drive, he's skinny,

421
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,730
<14-10,MARTHA>他会这样笑
<14-10,MARTHA>Oh, and he has this laugh like...wah-um.

422
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,190
<14-11,MARTHA>我甚至不会  就像鹅叫那样
<14-11,MARTHA>I can't even do it. It's like a honking goose kind of...

423
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,570
<14-12,CASTLE>就是这些情景剧原因而分手
<14-12,CASTLE>These are sitcom reasons for breaking up.

424
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,810
<14-12,CASTLE>今早你们还相爱
<14-12,CASTLE>This morning you were in love.

425
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,970
<14-12,CASTLE>这怎么可能
<14-12,CASTLE>What possibly could've happened?

426
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,270
<14-13,ALEXIS>爸爸  后退  火花熄灭了
<14-13,ALEXIS>Dad, back off. The spark died.

427
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,060
<14-13,ALEXIS>她显然重新考虑了
<14-13,ALEXIS>She's obviously reconsidered.

428
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,010
<14-14,MARTHA>没错
<14-14,MARTHA>That's right,

429
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,490
<14-14,MARTHA>我们现在试试这5种伤感口味
<14-14,MARTHA>And now we're going through the five flavors of grieving.

430
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,650
<14-15,CASTLE>这是接受冰激凌的第一阶段吗
<14-15,CASTLE>Oh. Is the first stage accepting the ice cream?

431
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,870
<15-1,RYAN>-完全正确  -那算我一份

<15-3,RYAN>睡得很沉
<15-3,RYAN>He slept like a rock.

434
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,500
<15-3,RYAN>霍洛威医生今早来了
<15-3,RYAN>Doc Holloway stopped by this morning

435
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,510
<15-3,RYAN>给他做认知能力测试
<15-3,RYAN>To give him a cognitive abilities test.

436
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,550
<15-3,RYAN>算术得分很高
<15-3,RYAN>Scored through the roof on the quantitative part.

437
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,770
<15-4,BECKETT>他数学不错  也许他是会计或金融领域
<15-4,BECKETT>He's good at math. Maybe he was an engineer

438
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,060
<15-4,BECKETT>工程师
<15-4,BECKETT>In accounting or financing.

439
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,820
<15-5,RYAN>或只是数学好而已
<15-5,RYAN>Or just good at math.

442
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,800
<15-5,RYAN>也许他想说服芬克展出他的作品
<15-5,RYAN>Maybe he was trying convince Fink to show his work.

443
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,050
<15-6,BECKETT>我觉得我们应该感激
<15-6,BECKETT>I suppose we should be thankful

444
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,220
<15-6,BECKETT>他没说画裸体画
<15-6,BECKETT>He didn't offer to pose nude.

<15-14,BECKETT>Well, until we figure out who he is, we've got nothing.

453
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,020
<16-1,BECKETT>结论是什么
<16-1,BECKETT>So what's the verdict?

454

<16-24,TORY WESTCHESTER>到十月为止两年
<16-24,TORY WESTCHESTER>Two years this past October.

477
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,800

<16-25,BECKETT>And you said his name was Joel...

478
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,300
<16-25,BECKETT>威彻斯特
<16-25,BECKETT>Westchester.

484
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,500
<16-30,CASTLE>我想他哮喘发作了
<16-30,CASTLE>I think he's having an asthma attack.

485
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,030
<16-31,BECKETT>你口袋里有哮喘气雾剂  快拿出来

<16-33,TORY WESTCHESTER>Eight, like Jon and Kate.

488
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,410
<16-34,CASTLE>我想乔伊对猫过敏
<16-34,CASTLE>I think Joel here is allergic to cats.

489
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,640
<16-35,TORY WESTCHESTER>真的吗
<16-35,TORY WESTCHESTER>Really?

490
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,180
<16-36,BECKETT>威彻斯特夫人  你不是他妻子  对吗
<16-36,BECKETT>Ms. Westchester, you're not really married to him, are you?

491
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,410
<16-37,TORY WESTCHESTER>我就是
<16-37,TORY WESTCHESTER>I could be.

<16-37,TORY WESTCHESTER>我就是他妻子  为什么我不是
<16-37,TORY WESTCHESTER>I so could be. Why the hell shouldn't I be?!

<17-1,RYAN>有记录的每种病态人格她都有
<17-1,RYAN>Every personality disorder in the book.

496
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,490
<17-1,RYAN>真是不幸
<17-1,RYAN>Sorry about that.

497
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,080
<17-2,CASTLE>又一个"谁想嫁给失忆者"游戏的参赛者
<17-2,CASTLE>Just another contestant on "who wants to marry an amnesiac?"

498
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,120
<17-3,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  大使馆人员哈伦先生来了
<17-3,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, your attacher, Mr.Harun, he's on his way down.

499
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,250
<17-3,MONTGOMERY>他愿意接受询问
<17-3,MONTGOMERY>He agreed to talk.

500
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,640
<18-1,RYAN>他自己送上门来了
<18-1,RYAN>He just showed up voluntarily?

501
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,820
<18-2,CASTLE>他想平息事态
<18-2,CASTLE>He wants to stay in control.

502
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,740
<18-3,BECKETT>这可能是我们唯一的机会
<18-3,BECKETT>This could be our only shot.

503
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,590
<18-3,BECKETT>所以一定要让哈伦
<18-3,BECKETT>Let's make sure that Harun

504
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,450
<18-3,BECKETT>-好好看看杰  -像无心的一样
<18-3,BECKETT>- Gets a good look at our friend Jay. - Inadvertent, of course.

505
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,690
<18-5,BECKETT>如果哈伦认为他杀了杰  他的反应
<18-5,BECKETT>If Harun thinks that he killed Jay, then his reaction

506
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,920
<18-5,BECKETT>会告诉我们一切  开工
<18-5,BECKETT>Could tell us everything we need to know. Let's go.

507
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,640
<19-1,BECKETT>哈伦先生  你曾是芬克先生的客户是吗
<19-1,BECKETT>Mr.Harun, you were a client of Mr. Fink's?

508
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,050
<19-2,BAHIR HARUN>没错
<19-2,BAHIR HARUN>That's correct.

509
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,330
<19-3,BECKETT>-你从他那里买了大量作品  -是的
<19-3,BECKETT>- You bought a significant number of works from him.  - Yes.

510
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,270
<19-1,BECKETT>我们认为其中很多作品是伪造的
<19-1,BECKETT>Well, we believe that many of those works were forgeries.

511
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,500
<19-2,BAHIR HARUN>的确是的
<19-2,BAHIR HARUN>That's correct.

512
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,070
<19-7,BECKETT>这么说你早就知道那些是赝品
<19-7,BECKETT>So you're saying that you knew they were fakes?

513
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,460
<19-9,BECKETT>-当然知道  -那你还买
<19-9,BECKETT>- Of course I knew. - And you bought them anyway?

514
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,220
<19-10,BAHIR HARUN>怎么说呢  我家里有很多朋友
<19-10,BAHIR HARUN>I have many friends back home whose wives are,

515
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,070
<19-10,BAHIR HARUN>他们的妻子总不满足
<19-10,BAHIR HARUN>How shall we say, uh, demanding.

516
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,700
<19-11,BECKETT>那她们要赝品干什么
<19-11,BECKETT>And what do demanding wives have to do with any of this?

517
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,440
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>大家都知道  女性比较肤浅
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>Well, we all know that the fairer sex can be shallow.

518
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,220
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>当然不包括你  探长
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>Not you, of course, detective--

519
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,490
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>你是个聪明又开放的美国女性
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>A smart, liberated American woman.

520
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,030
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>但是我朋友的妻子
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>But my friends' wives,

521
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,730
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>她们想要品牌包  如古奇
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>They want a bag that says, um, "Gucci."

522
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,920
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>她们不在乎是谁生产的
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>They don't care who made the bag

523
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,880
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>只要包上有那个标签
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>As long as it has that signature.

524
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,680
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>关于画作  同理可知
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>And it's the same with paintings.

525
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,180
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>比起作品本身
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>They are more appreciative of--of the signature

526
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,860
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>她们更看重签名
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>Than of the-- the work itself.

527
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>我的朋友们不愿意老花大把钞票
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>And my friends don't always want to spend top dollar

528
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,190
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>去买那些真货  就托维克多弄个赝品
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>On authentic pieces, so Victor would commission a copy.

529
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,660
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>朋友可以省钱  而我赚钱
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>My friends save money, I get rich...

530
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,840
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>女人也会以为
<19-12,BAHIR HARUN>And the wives get to think that they have...

531
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,270
<19-13,RYAN>-往左挪一步  -好
<19-13,RYAN>- Move to your left, just a drop.- Yeah.

532
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,860
<19-18,CASTLE>所以你只从芬克那里买赝品
<19-18,CASTLE>So you only bought fakes from Fink?

533
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,130
<19-19,BAHIR HARUN>不全是  他也提供一些真货
<19-19,BAHIR HARUN>No. He would also source originals

534
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,480
<19-19,BAHIR HARUN>给那些有品位的男人们
<19-19,BAHIR HARUN>For those husbands with taste.

535
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,520
<19-21,BAHIR HARUN>我很乐意提供  尽管真货赚的少
<19-21,BAHIR HARUN>I was happy to provide, even though originals pay less...

536
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,870
<19-20,RYAN>觉得眼熟吗
<19-20,RYAN>He look familiar?

537
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,120
<19-22,JEREMY PRESWICK>没有  抱歉
<19-22,JEREMY PRESWICK>No, sorry.

538
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,880
<19-23,BECKETT>芬克先生被杀的当晚
<19-23,BECKETT>The night that Mr. Fink was murdered,

539
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,990
<19-23,BECKETT>案发不久前你曾跟他通过话
<19-23,BECKETT>You called him not long before he was killed.

540
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,140
<19-23,BECKETT>是的  警探
<19-23,BECKETT>That's correct, detective.

541
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,580
<19-24,BAHIR HARUN>他要我过去一趟  说有幅画给我看
<19-24,BAHIR HARUN>He--he told me to come by, that he had a painting for me.

542
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,510
<19-24,BAHIR HARUN>我大约9点45到那  但他打发我走
<19-24,BAHIR HARUN>I showed up around 9:45,  but he sent me away.

543
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,510
<19-25,BECKETT>打发你走
<19-25,BECKETT>Sent you away?

544
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,990
<19-26,BAHIR HARUN>是的  他当时在跟另一个人争吵
<19-26,BAHIR HARUN>Yes, he was arguing with a man.

545
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,070
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>-吵什么  -不知道
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>- About what? - I have no idea.

546
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,830
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>如他所愿  我离开了
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>I respected his wishes

547
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,770
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>然后去诺布餐厅吃饭
<19-28,BAHIR HARUN>And went for dinner at Nobu.

548
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,900
<19-29,BECKETT>你能描述一下这个人吗
<19-29,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe this man?

549
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,820
<19-30,BAHIR HARUN>拜托  有必要继续这种无聊游戏吗
<19-30,BAHIR HARUN>Please. Must we continue with this ridiculous charade?

550
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,380
<19-30,BAHIR HARUN>我们都知道他就站在那里
<19-30,BAHIR HARUN>When we both know he is standing right there?

551
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,220
<19-31,BAHIR HARUN>那么  如果没有其他事情
<19-31,BAHIR HARUN>Now if that is all...

552
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,470
<19-32,BECKETT>哈伦先生  我还没问完
<19-32,BECKETT>Mr.Harun,  I'm not quite done yet.

553
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,070
<19-33,BAHIR HARUN>但我说完了
<19-33,BAHIR HARUN>Ah, but I am.

554
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,890
<19-33,BAHIR HARUN>希望你们过得愉快
<19-33,BAHIR HARUN>Have a nice day.

555
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,630
<20-1,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Thanks.

556
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,190
<20-2,CASTLE>对一个有外交豁免权的人来说
<20-2,CASTLE>For a guy with diplomatic immunity,

557
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,410
<20-2,CASTLE>他也不算特别有外交手腕
<20-2,CASTLE>He wasn't very diplomatic.

558
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,220
<20-3,BECKETT>哈伦在利用豁免权做挡箭牌
<20-3,BECKETT>Harun's hiding behind his immunity.

559
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,220
<20-3,BECKETT>他知道的远不止这些
<20-3,BECKETT>He knows more than he's saying.

560
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,660
<20-4,ESPOSITO>也许  但他的不在场证明是真的
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Maybe. But his alibi is good.

561
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,410
<20-4,ESPOSITO>诺布餐厅的监控录像录到
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Nobu has him on security video

562
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,990
<20-4,ESPOSITO>他晚上9点55进门
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Entering at 9:55 p.m.,

563
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,970
<20-4,ESPOSITO>也就是报警前19分钟
<20-4,ESPOSITO>19 minutes before the 9-1-1 call about shots fired.

564
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,890
<20-4,ESPOSITO>他不是凶手
<20-4,ESPOSITO>He's not our guy.

565
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,240
<20-5,BECKETT>但是  不是他开的枪
<20-5,BECKETT>Well, just because he didn't pull the trigger

566
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,530
<20-5,BECKETT>并不意味着他与此案无关
<20-5,BECKETT>Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

567
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,780
<20-6,CASTLE>杰中枪了
<20-6,CASTLE>And just because Jay was shot

568
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,620
<20-6,CASTLE>也不意味着他是清白的
<20-6,CASTLE>Doesn't mean he wasn't into something shady.

569
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,010
<20-6,CASTLE>这可能就是他中枪的原因
<20-6,CASTLE>It could be the reason he was shot.

570
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,650
<20-7,BECKETT>哈伦说他看到杰跟芬克在争吵
<20-7,BECKETT>Harun said he saw Jay arguing with Fink.

571
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,720
<20-8,ESPOSITO>我们要搞清楚为什么杰会在画廊
<20-8,ESPOSITO>We need to figure out why Jay was at the gallery.

572
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,380
<20-9,BECKETT>如果不知道他到底是谁  就不能搞清楚
<20-9,BECKETT>And we can't do that if we don't know who the hell he is.

573
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,060
<21-1,RYAN>我们已经查过一遍了  只是一堆垃圾
<21-1,RYAN>We've been through this. It's just a bunch of junk.

574
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,190
<21-2,BECKETT>但如果我们仔细清理一下
<21-2,BECKETT>But if we take a look at everything

575
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,860
<21-2,BECKETT>手头的所有资料  也许会有所发现
<21-2,BECKETT>We know about him collectively, maybe a picture will emerge.

576
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,460
<21-3,RYAN>这些钥匙没什么特别
<21-3,RYAN>Nothing distinctive about these keys.

577
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,490
<21-4,CASTLE>确实  那个塑料袋也的确缩小了范围
<21-4,CASTLE>Yeah, and that plastic bag really narrows it down.

578
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,720
<21-5,BECKETT>他患有哮喘病
<21-5,BECKETT>Okay, he's got asthma,

579
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,560
<21-5,BECKETT>对猫过敏  爱读书
<21-5,BECKETT>He's allergic to cats, he reads--

580
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,500
<21-6,RYAN>还精通数学  不会画画
<21-6,RYAN>And he's good at math and he can't draw.

581
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,580
<21-6,RYAN>综合看来  他只是个数学健将
<21-6,RYAN>Put it together, he's your average math athlete

582
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,000
<21-6,RYAN>口袋里还装着很多垃圾
<21-6,RYAN>With a lot of crap in his pocket.

583
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,140
<21-7,UNIFORM>-探长  -谢谢
<21-7,UNIFORM>- Detective. - Thank you.

584
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,610
<21-8,BECKETT>蕾妮对他外套的检验报告
<21-8,BECKETT>It's from Lanie. It's the forensics report on his coat.

585
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,420
<21-9,CASTLE>也许他的驾照还缝在里衬
<21-9,CASTLE>Maybe his driver's license was sewn into the lining.

586
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,370
<21-10,BECKETT>有火药残留物
<21-10,BECKETT>Gunpowder residue.

587
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:44,770
<21-11,RYAN>这么说他是被近距离射击的
<21-11,RYAN>So he was shot at close range

588
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,320
<21-12,BECKETT>还有咖啡渍  糖粒  和牛奶印迹
<21-12,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Coffee stains, sugar granules, traces of milk.

589
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
<21-13,CASTLE>可以知道他是怎么喝咖啡的了
<21-13,CASTLE>Well, we know how he takes his coffee.

590
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,350
<21-15,RYAN>-动物的毛  -不是猫毛
<21-15,RYAN>- Animal hairs. - Not cat hairs.

591
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,140
<21-16,CASTLE>-我怎么忽略了这个  -忽略什么
<21-16,CASTLE>- How could I have missed this? - Missed what?

592
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,510
<21-19,RYAN>-知道这是什么吗  -知道  食品袋
<21-19,RYAN>- Do you know what this is?  - Yeah, it's a grocery bag.

593
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,690
<21-20,CASTLE>不  不仅仅是食品袋
<21-20,CASTLE>No, it's not just a grocery bag.

594
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,230
<21-20,CASTLE>这个袋子能告诉我们杰的真实身份
<21-20,CASTLE>It's the bag that's gonna tell us exactly who Jay is.

595
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,010
<22-1,BECKETT>为什么硬拉我回画廊
<22-1,BECKETT>Why are you dragging me back to the art gallery?

596
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,820
<22-2,CASTLE>不是去画廊  是那条街
<22-2,CASTLE>Not to the art gallery, to the street.

597
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,810
<22-3,BECKETT>-不见了 -什么不见了
<22-3,BECKETT>- Ah, it's gone. - What's gone?

598
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,590
<22-4,CASTLE>那只狗  这就是他带着食品袋的原因
<22-4,CASTLE>The dog. That's why he had the bag,

599
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,620
<22-4,CASTLE>为了用袋子清理狗粪
<22-4,CASTLE>To clean up after his dog.

600
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,840
<22-5,BECKETT>你怎么知道那就是他的狗
<22-5,BECKETT>How do you know it was his dog?

601
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,300
<22-6,CASTLE>那他为什么拿个袋子
<22-6,CASTLE>Well, why else would he have a bag?

602
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,880
<22-6,CASTLE>为什么过了午夜还有一只狗
<22-6,CASTLE>Why else would there be a dog tied up

603
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,470
<22-6,CASTLE>被拴在一栋商业大楼外
<22-6,CASTLE>Outside a commercial building after midnight?

604
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,930
<22-6,CASTLE>可能有人把狗偷走了
<22-6,CASTLE>Maybe someone stole it.

605
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,510
<22-7,BECKETT>帮我接动物管理处
<22-7,BECKETT>Get me animal control.

606
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,060
<22-7,BECKETT>挂狗牌的都是24小时内收养的
<22-7,BECKETT>All the canines with I.D. tags we picked up in the last 24.

607
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,110
<22-7,BECKETT>大部分是主人不小心弄丢了
<22-7,BECKETT>Mostly their owners lost 'em accidentally

608
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,670
<22-7,BECKETT>我们打去电话  他们就松了口气
<22-7,BECKETT>And are relieved when we call.

609
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,120
<23-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<23-1,BECKETT>Castle.

610
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,740
<23-2,CASTLE>多漂亮的家伙啊
<23-2,CASTLE>Oh. Who's a good girl?

611
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,260
<23-2,CASTLE>这只是从148大街西26号捡回的
<23-2,CASTLE>That one's from 148 west 26th.

612
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,280
<23-3,BECKETT>就是芬克的画廊那里
<23-3,BECKETT>That's Fink's gallery.

613
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,810
<23-4,CASTLE>露西
<23-4,CASTLE>Lucy.

614
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,840
<23-4,CASTLE>你叫杰里米·普瑞斯威科
<23-4,CASTLE>Your name is Jeremy Preswick.

615
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,440
<24-1,BECKETT>已经和机动车管理部的照片核对过了
<24-1,BECKETT>We checked it against your D.M.V. photo,

616
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,760
<24-1,BECKETT>是你的真实身份
<24-1,BECKETT>And it's a positive I.D.

617
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,660
<24-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>-杰里米·普瑞斯威科  -你今年34岁
<24-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>- Jeremy Preswick. - You are 34 years old,

618
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,810
<24-3,BECKETT>住在特里贝克地区华伦街82号
<24-3,BECKETT>And you live at 82 warren street in Tribeca.

619
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,540
<24-3,BECKETT>你没有什么亲人
<24-3,BECKETT>You don't really have any family.

620
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,430
<24-3,BECKETT>父母几年前过世
<24-3,BECKETT>Your parents passed away a few years ago,

621
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,140
<24-3,BECKETT>也没有兄弟姐妹
<24-3,BECKETT>And you don't have any siblings.

622
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,730
<24-3,BECKETT>但我们联系到了你的前妻爱玛·卡恩斯
<24-3,BECKETT>But we did manage to get a hold of your ex-wife, Emma Carnes.

623
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,490
<24-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>前妻
<24-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>Ex-wife?

624
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,080
<24-5,BECKETT>我离过婚
<24-5,BECKETT>I'm divorced?

625
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,130
<24-6,JEREMY PRESWICK>没错
<24-6,JEREMY PRESWICK>Yeah.

626
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,750
<24-7,BECKETT>抱歉  你前妻听说你的情况后很关心你
<24-7,BECKETT>Sorry. Your ex sounded pretty concerned.

627
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,510
<24-7,BECKETT>我们认为这可能是
<24-7,BECKETT>And we figured that would be the fastest way

628
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,860
<24-7,BECKETT>弄清事情原委最快捷的方法
<24-7,BECKETT>Of putting together the details,

629
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,120
<24-7,BECKETT>也对你和我们的调查都有很大帮助
<24-7,BECKETT>Which would be great for you and for our investigation.

630
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,050
<24-8,JEREMY PRESWICK>你们看着办吧
<24-8,JEREMY PRESWICK>If you think it'll help.

631
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,910
<24-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>我连我有前妻都不记得
<24-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>I have an ex-wife that I can't remember.

632
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,190
<24-10,CASTLE>有人还觉得你很幸运呢
<24-10,CASTLE>Hey, some men would consider you lucky.

633

<24-30,CASTLE>你知道为什么吗
<24-30,CASTLE>Do you know why?

658
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,750
<24-31,EMMA CARNES>不知道  我也觉得不可思议
<24-31,EMMA CARNES>No. I thought it was weird.

661
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,750
<24-33,EMMA CARNES>关于这个我向朋友们抱怨了很久
<24-33,EMMA CARNES>I've ranted for hours to girlfriends about that.

662
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,510
<24-34,JEREMY PRESWICK>我猜我肯定被你骂得一文不值
<24-34,JEREMY PRESWICK>I'm guessing I don't come off so well in that rant.

663
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,950
<24-35,EMMA CARNES>那时你就是个混蛋
<24-35,EMMA CARNES>You were a jerk.

<24-36,JEREMY PRESWICK>但我也有错
<24-36,JEREMY PRESWICK>But so was I.

665
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,170
<24-37,EMMA CARNES>也许因为我们结婚太早了
<24-37,EMMA CARNES>I mean, the truth is, We probably got married too young.

666
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,370
<24-38,JEREMY PRESWICK>我认不出你  对此我很抱歉

<24-38,JEREMY PRESWICK>我确信当时完全是我的错
<24-38,JEREMY PRESWICK>And I'm certain that it was entirely my fault

669
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,480
<24-38,JEREMY PRESWICK>以至于毁了我们的婚姻
<24-38,JEREMY PRESWICK>That marriage fell apart.

<25-14,BECKETT>这里很零乱
<25-14,BECKETT>It's pretty sparse.

707

717
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,340
<25-20,EMMA CARNES>就是把这幅画卖掉  然后分掉这笔钱
<25-20,EMMA CARNES>Was to sell it and split the cash.

732
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,460
<26-3,BECKETT>那只能说明他是被近距离射击的
<26-3,BECKETT>Well, that just means that he was shot at close range.

733
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,010
<26-4,CASTLE>假设是杰里米拿着抢
<26-4,CASTLE>Like if Jeremy were holding the gun,

734
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,310
<26-4,CASTLE>与芬克扭打在一起  芬克把枪转向他
<26-4,CASTLE>Struggled with Fink, Fink managed to turn the gun around

735
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,260
<26-4,CASTLE>然后开火
<26-4,CASTLE>And it went off?

736
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,950
<26-5,LANIE>芬克手腕上的淤青
<26-5,LANIE>Well, these abrasions on Fink's wrists

737
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,470
<26-5,LANIE>正好与你刚才说的吻合
<26-5,LANIE>Are certainly consistent with that.

738
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,350
<26-6,BECKETT>那他为何会把枪留在公寓里
<26-6,BECKETT>Well, then why would he have left the gun in his apartment?

739
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,660
<26-7,CASTLE>霍洛威医生说过  他可能处于神游状态
<26-7,CASTLE>Doc Holloway said he was probably in a fugue state,

740
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,000
<26-7,CASTLE>比如梦游  他可能丢下枪然后
<26-7,CASTLE>Like sleepwalking. He could've dropped the gun off

741
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,070
<26-7,CASTLE>然后又重新回到画廊
<26-7,CASTLE>And then went back out again.

742
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,150
<26-8,LANIE>好吧  我糊涂了
<26-8,LANIE>Okay, am I  missing something?

743
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,190
<26-8,LANIE>我以为你们抓到了凶手
<26-8,LANIE>I thought you were supposed to be happy

744
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,880
<26-8,LANIE>应该高兴才是
<26-8,LANIE>After you caught the killer.

745
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,050
<27-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>我为什么杀人
<27-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>Why'd I do it?

746
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,490
<27-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>我们不知道原因
<27-1,JEREMY PRESWICK>We don't know why.

747
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,350
<27-2,BECKETT>你需要聘请一位律师
<27-2,BECKETT>You'll be appointed a lawyer.

748
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,290
<27-2,BECKETT>我知道艾玛想给你找一个
<27-2,BECKETT>I know that Emma wants to help hire someone,

749
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,450
<27-2,BECKETT>我想钱不是问题
<27-2,BECKETT>And I don't think money will be an issue.

750
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,820
<27-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>谢谢
<27-3,JEREMY PRESWICK>Well, thank you.

751
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,000
<27-4,BECKETT>不知道你为什么谢我  普瑞斯威科先生
<27-4,BECKETT>I don't know why you're thanking me, Mr. Prestwick.

752
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,430
<27-4,BECKETT>我们以谋杀罪逮捕了你
<27-4,BECKETT>We just arrested you for murder.

753
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,190
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>没错  但那不是你们的错
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>Yeah, well, it's not your fault.

754
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,700
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>对一个自认为是受害者
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>You guys have been nothing but incredibly nice

755
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,770
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>又一无所知的白痴  你们已经够好了
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>To a babbling idiot  who thought he was a victim

756
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,280
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>感觉就像我欺骗了你们
<27-5,JEREMY PRESWICK>It's like I tricked you.

757
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,400
<27-6,CASTLE>祝你好运  杰里米
<27-6,CASTLE>Good luck, Jeremy.

758
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,310
<27-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>你们查明真相之后  能告诉我吗
<27-7,JEREMY PRESWICK>If you figure it out, would you let me know?

759
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,570
<27-8,BECKETT>当然
<27-8,BECKETT>Of course.

760
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,600
<27-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>知道原因的话  可能会好过一点
<27-9,JEREMY PRESWICK>I just think it would be easier knowing why.

761
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,850
<28-1,CASTLE>为根本不记得的杀人而内疚
<28-1,CASTLE>The guy is guilty of a murder he can't remember.

762
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,050
<28-1,CASTLE>真让人郁闷
<28-1,CASTLE>That just sucks.

763
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,580
<28-1,CASTLE>我是说  如果你打算杀人
<28-1,CASTLE>I mean, if you're gonna kill someone, get caught,

764
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,060
<28-1,CASTLE>被抓后得在监狱里度过余生
<28-1,CASTLE>Spend the rest of your life in prison, at least

765
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,390
<28-1,CASTLE>至少你还知道自己为何坐牢
<28-1,CASTLE>You have the satisfaction of knowing why you did it--

766
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,850
<28-1,CASTLE>仇恨  报复  破坏  甚至公路抢劫
<28-1,CASTLE>Hatred, revenge, hell, maybe even cut you off on the highway.

767
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,640
<28-1,CASTLE>即使找到杀人动机  杰里米还是不知道
<28-1,CASTLE>But Jeremy won't even have that even if we do find motive

768
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,310
<28-1,CASTLE>因为他不记得杀人的意义何在
<28-1,CASTLE>Because he won't remember why it meant anything to him.

769
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,350
<28-2,BECKETT>我跟你一样  卡塞尔  觉得郁闷
<28-2,BECKETT>I'm with you, Castle. It sucks.

770
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,310
<28-3,CASTLE>下一步怎么办
<28-3,CASTLE>So what next?

771
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,030
<28-4,BECKETT>我们把书面报告呈交给地方检察官
<28-4,BECKETT>We, uh, submit the paperwork to the D.A.

772
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,920
<28-5,CASTLE>可地方检察官也需要动机啊  不是吗
<28-5,CASTLE>But the D.A. will need motive, right?

773
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,460
<28-6,BECKETT>不  证据说话  确凿的证据
<28-6,BECKETT>No. Evidence speaks. Smoking gun.

774
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,820
<28-7,CASTLE>你不想知道他为什么杀人吗
<28-7,CASTLE>But don't you want to know why he did it?

775
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,260
<28-8,BECKETT>想  但事实上  我们并不需要知道
<28-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but the truth is, is that we don't need it.

776
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,870
<28-9,CASTLE>地方检察官不需要
<28-9,CASTLE>The D.A. doesn't need it.

777
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,530
<28-9,CASTLE>但你和我呢
<28-9,CASTLE>But you and me?

778
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,490
<28-9,CASTLE>我昨晚彻夜难眠  你呢
<28-9,CASTLE>I know I couldn't sleep last night. Could you?

779
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,660
<29-1,CASTLE>这里肯定有答案
<29-1,CASTLE>There's gotta be an answer here,

780
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,120
<29-1,CASTLE>他生活里的东西肯定能解释一切
<29-1,CASTLE>Something in his life that makes it all make sense.

781
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,570
<29-2,BECKETT>举起手来  不许动
<29-2,BECKETT>Hands! Show 'em.

782
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,030
<29-3,EMMA CARNES>吓死我了
<29-3,EMMA CARNES>Oh, that gets the heart rate going.

783
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,210
<29-4,BECKETT>卡恩斯女士  你在这里做什么
<29-4,BECKETT>Ms. Carnes, what are you doing here?

784
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,010
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>拿一些露西的东西
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>Getting Lucy's things.

785
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,010
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>处方药
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>Prescription.

786
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,880
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>我想得由我保管了
<29-5,EMMA CARNES>I guess I have custody now.

787
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,730
<29-6,BECKETT>很抱歉吓到你了  我们不知道你在这里
<29-6,BECKETT>I'm sorry to surprise you.  We didn't know you'd be here.

788
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,470
<29-7,BECKETT>你没事吧
<29-7,BECKETT>Are you okay?

789
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,610
<29-8,EMMA CARNES>没事  我只是突然想到
<29-8,EMMA CARNES>Yeah. I guess I just thought for half a second

790
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,730
<29-8,EMMA CARNES>这于我和他是一次难得又怪异机会
<29-8,EMMA CARNES>That this would be a bizarre second chance for Jer and me.

791
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,430
<29-9,CASTLE>-很蠢  是吗  -不  一点都不蠢
<29-9,CASTLE>- Stupid, right? - No, it's not stupid.

792
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,250
<29-9,CASTLE>发现他是个杀人凶手之后
<29-9,CASTLE>And to find out that he's a murderer...

793
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,370
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>当我再次见到他时  我
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>When I saw him again, I...

794
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,260
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>那么多年的争吵
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>All those years of petty arguments

795
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,100
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>导致后来的分离  都不算什么了
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>Thatore us apart didn't seem to matter.

796
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,430
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>就像  我们初次见面
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>It was--it was like we first met.

797
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,170
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>我找回了那种感觉
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>You know, I felt that thing.

798
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,540
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>然后我们来这里  看见他不愿意卖掉它
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>And then we came here and I saw that he didn't sell it,

799
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,670
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>我觉得他也对我念念不忘
<29-10,EMMA CARNES>And I thought maybe he still had feelings for me, too.

800
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,940
<29-11,BECKETT>你是指这幅
<29-11,BECKETT>Do you mean the painting

801
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,130
<29-11,BECKETT>你们俩蜜月时买的油画
<29-11,BECKETT>That the two of you bought on your honeymoon?

802
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,310
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>是的  不是因为我们想买
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>Yeah, we didn't buy it because we wanted to.

803
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,490
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>而是必须买
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>We had to.

804
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,670
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>当时我们在锡耶纳的一家画廊
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>We were in the artist's studio in Siena

805
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,290
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>杰里米从画架上拿起它
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>And Jeremy picked it up off the easel.

806
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:44,660
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>画还没干透呢  他总是冒冒失失的
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>He was always goofing around. The artist went crazy.

807
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,970
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>那个画家都快疯了
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>It was still drying.

808
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,180
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>为这个爱情印记我们笑了好久
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>We laughed for a week about our little love smudge.

809
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,880
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>当我看见他没有卖掉它  我就在想
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>And then when I saw that he didn't sell it, I thought,

810
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,940
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>或许
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>Maybe...

811
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,520
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>但我是在自欺欺人
<29-12,EMMA CARNES>But I was kidding myself.

812
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,200
<29-13,BECKETT>为什么这么说
<29-13,BECKETT>What do you mean?

813
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,720
<29-14,EMMA CARNES>没有手指印  就是这里
<29-14,EMMA CARNES>No thumbprint. It should be right here.

814
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,780
<29-14,EMMA CARNES>他卖掉了原来那幅画  这个是副本
<29-14,EMMA CARNES>He sold ours. This one's just a copy.

815
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,550
<29-15,BECKETT>卡恩斯女士  你确定吗
<29-15,BECKETT>Ms. Carnes, are you sure?

816
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,210
<29-16,EMMA CARNES>当然  确信无疑
<29-16,EMMA CARNES>Of course I'm sure.

817
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,620
<29-17,CASTLE>是赝品
<29-17,CASTLE>It's a fake.

818
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,850
<29-18,BECKETT>我们知道谁倒卖赝品
<29-18,BECKETT>And we know who dealt in fakes.

819
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,150
<29-19,CASTLE>这就能将杰里米和芬克联系起来了
<29-19,CASTLE>That's gotta be Jeremy's connection to Fink.

820
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,170
<29-19,CASTLE>也解释了为何杰里米会在画廊
<29-19,CASTLE>That's gotta be why Jeremy was at the gallery.

821
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,500
<29-20,BECKETT>如果像哈伦说的杰里米和芬克在争吵
<29-20,BECKETT>And if Jeremy and Fink were arguing like Harun said,

822
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,830
<29-20,BECKETT>或许就是为了真品
<29-20,BECKETT>Maybe it was over the original.

823
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,990
<29-21,CASTLE>如果这是赝品  那真品在哪里
<29-21,CASTLE>And if that's a fake, then where is the original?

824
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,320
<30-2,BAHIR HARUN>当然  小心那幅画
<30-2,BAHIR HARUN>Absolutely, and, uh-- Careful with that one.

825
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,580
<30-2,BAHIR HARUN>好的  谢谢  再见[法语]
<30-2,BAHIR HARUN>Oui. Oui, merci. A bientot.

826
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,220
<30-3,BECKETT>哈伦先生  这么快就走了吗
<30-3,BECKETT>Leaving us so soon, Mr. Harun?

827
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,550
<30-4,BAHIR HARUN>怎么了  我还要赶飞机
<30-4,BAHIR HARUN>Oh, what now?  I have a plane to catch.

828
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,630
<30-5,CASTLE>这次旅行收获了不错的作品吗
<30-5,CASTLE>Make any interesting art acquisitions on this trip?

829
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,380
<30-6,BAHIR HARUN>确实有些收获
<30-6,BAHIR HARUN>Actually, yes.

830
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
<30-7,CASTLE>介意我们看一看吗
<30-7,CASTLE>Mind if we take a look?

831
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,100
<30-8,BAHIR HARUN>很抱歉  我没有时间
<30-8,BAHIR HARUN>I'm sorry.  I just don't have the time.

832
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,170
<30-9,BECKETT>挤出时间
<30-9,BECKETT>Make time.

833
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,820
<30-10,BAHIR HARUN>"外交豁免权"的哪一部分
<30-10,BAHIR HARUN>What part of "diplomatic immunity"

834
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,630
<30-10,BAHIR HARUN>你们不太清楚
<30-10,BAHIR HARUN>Are you not clear on?

835
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,410
<30-11,BECKETT>你每次这样说时
<30-11,BECKETT>See, every time you say something like that,

836
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,980
<30-11,BECKETT>就让我觉得你在隐瞒什么
<30-11,BECKETT>It makes me think that you have something to hide.

837
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,900
<30-12,BAHIR HARUN>你永远也找不出来  真糟糕
<30-12,BAHIR HARUN>It's too bad that you will never find out.

838
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,940
<30-13,BECKETT>请出示驾照和行驶证
<30-13,BECKETT>License and registration, please.

839
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,000
<30-15,BECKETT>-什么  为什么  -你们并排停车
<30-15,BECKETT>- What? Why? - You are double parked.

840
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
<30-16,DRIVER>这是纽约  人人都并排停车
<30-16,DRIVER>This is New York. Everyone double parks.

841
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,230
<30-17,CASTLE>-他是妨碍公务吗  -我想是的
<30-17,CASTLE>- Is he resisting arrest? - I believe so.

842
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,460
<30-18,BECKETT>站到这边来
<30-18,BECKETT>Step over here.

843
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,780
<30-19,BECKETT>我们要查车
<30-19,BECKETT>We're gonna have to search your car.

844
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,810
<30-20,BAHIR HARUN>你没有权利这么做
<30-20,BAHIR HARUN>You have no right to do this.

845
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,520
<30-21,BECKETT>我没看到任何外交牌照
<30-21,BECKETT>I don't see any diplomatic plates.

846
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,280
<30-21,BECKETT>豁免权不包括汽车
<30-21,BECKETT>And immunity doesn't extend to a car service.

847
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,860
<31-1,BECKETT>哈伦先生  你有两条路可选
<31-1,BECKETT>Mr. Harun, this can go one of two ways,

848
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,070
<31-1,BECKETT>要么合作  说出我们想要知道的
<31-1,BECKETT>You can either cooperate and tell me what I need to know

849
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,240
<31-1,BECKETT>要么我致电国务院
<31-1,BECKETT>Or I can call the state department

850
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,010
<31-1,BECKETT>通知他们你有一件艺术品
<31-1,BECKETT>And inform them that you have a piece of artwork

851
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,900
<31-1,BECKETT>和一件谋杀案有很大关联
<31-1,BECKETT>That's at the center of our murder investigation.

852
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,880
<31-2,CASTLE>最后我发现  纽约小报
<31-2,CASTLE>And the last I checked, the New York tabloids

853
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,150
<31-2,CASTLE>只会略微提及你的外交身份
<31-2,CASTLE>Could give a rat's ass about your diplomatic status.

854
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,550
<31-2,CASTLE>他们会用你的照片做头条
<31-2,CASTLE>They'll just print your photograph with a headline

855
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,990
<31-2,CASTLE>题目是"外交混蛋"
<31-2,CASTLE>That says "diplomatic douche bag."

856
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,300
<31-3,BAHIR HARUN>好吧  你们想知道什么
<31-3,BAHIR HARUN>Fine. What would you like to know?

857
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,140
<31-4,BECKETT>枪击案一名受害人家中
<31-4,BECKETT>There's a fake version of this painting

858
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,050
<31-4,BECKETT>发现了这幅油画的赝品
<31-4,BECKETT>Found in one of our shooting victim's apartments.

859
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,520
<31-5,BAHIR HARUN>-能告知是怎么回事吗  -我怎么知道
<31-5,BAHIR HARUN>- Can you tell us how it got there?  - How would I know this?

860
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,700
<31-6,CASTLE>因为赝品
<31-6,CASTLE>Because the fake painting is

861
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,190
<31-6,CASTLE>在真品曾经所在的地方
<31-6,CASTLE>Where the real painting used to be

862
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,890
<31-6,CASTLE>现在真品在你手里
<31-6,CASTLE>And now you have the real painting.

863
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,790
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>我只知道  这是我让芬克
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>All I know is that I asked Fink to acquire it

864
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,700
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>为我的客户所寻  当他说有了之后
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>For a client of mine.  When he said he had it,

865
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,800
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>我以为他找到画主并买了下来
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>I assumed he'd tracked down the owner and made a deal.

866
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,720
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>当我那晚到画廊后  他又打发我走了
<31-7,BAHIR HARUN>But when I went to the gallery that evening, he sent me away,

867
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,570
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>就像我说过的
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>Just like I told you.

868
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,470
<31-8,BECKETT>故事很精彩  哈伦先生
<31-8,BECKETT>That's a great story, Mr. Harun,

869
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,990
<31-8,BECKETT>可如果芬克打发你时  你是空手而归的
<31-8,BECKETT>But if Fink sent you away empty-handed,

870
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,340
<31-8,BECKETT>你又怎么会有这幅画吗
<31-8,BECKETT>Why do you have the painting?

871
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,360
<31-9,BAHIR HARUN>因为早上我接到一个人的电话
<31-9,BAHIR HARUN>Because I got a call from a man this morning

872
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,680
<31-9,BAHIR HARUN>说他有这幅画  想要出售
<31-9,BAHIR HARUN>That said he had it for a price.

873
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
<31-10,BECKETT>是谁
<31-10,BECKETT>Who was it?

874
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,980
<31-11,BAHIR HARUN>芬克的新助手达里斯
<31-11,BAHIR HARUN>It was Fink's new assistant Darius.

875
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,770
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>这太荒谬了
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>This is crazy.

876
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,040
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>我已经说过了
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>I told you already,

877
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,440
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>芬克先生被杀时我在上课
<32-1,DARIUS LANGLEY>I was in class when Mr. Fink was killed.

878
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,310
<32-2,BECKETT>-没人记得见过你  -我坐在后排
<32-2,BECKETT>- Nobody remembers seeing you there.  - I sat in the back.

879
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,770
<32-4,CASTLE>淘气的学生才那样
<32-4,CASTLE>The naughty kids always do.

880
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,660
<32-5,BECKETT>杰里米为油画找芬克对质那晚
<32-5,BECKETT>You were at the gallery the night that Jeremy

881
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,570
<32-5,BECKETT>你在画廊
<32-5,BECKETT>Confronted Fink about the painting.

882
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,410
<32-6,DARIUS LANGLEY>听着  显然这里面有误会
<32-6,DARIUS LANGLEY>Listen, there's obviously been some kind of misunderstanding.

883
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,830
<32-7,BECKETT>这也是误会吗
<32-7,BECKETT>Was this a misunderstanding as well?

884
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,750
<32-7,BECKETT>这是普瑞斯威科公寓管理员签署的声明
<32-7,BECKETT>It's a signed statement from the super at Prestwick's building

885
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,500
<32-7,BECKETT>承认他拿了你1000美元
<32-7,BECKETT>Admitting that he took a $1,000 bribe from you

886
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,980
<32-7,BECKETT>允许你进入杰里的公寓
<32-7,BECKETT>To allow you into Jeremy's apartment

887
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,140
<32-7,BECKETT>于是你换走了那幅画
<32-7,BECKETT>So that you could switch out the paintings.

888
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,920
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>抱歉  有必要从头开始说明一下
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>I'm sorry. Shoulda come clean from the start.

889
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,210
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>芬克想要那幅画
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>Fink wanted the painting.

890
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,740
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>他告诉我  跟普瑞斯威科买那幅画
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>He told me to buy it from Prestwick,

891
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,630
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>但这家伙不卖
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>But the guy wouldn't sell.

892
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,640
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>所以芬克让我画了幅赝品
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>So Fink had me paint a fake.

893
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,030
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>是的  我贿赂了管理员...
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>And, yeah, I-I bribed the super to...

894
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,950
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>为了和真品调包
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>Switch it with the real thing.

895
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,630
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>这很愚蠢
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>It was stupid,

896
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,320
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>但芬克威胁说  如果我不干就要被解雇
<32-8,DARIUS LANGLEY>But...Fink threatened to fire me if I didn't.

897
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,700
<32-9,BECKETT>全部都是你干的  达里斯
<32-9,BECKETT>It was all you, Darius.

898
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,470
<32-9,BECKETT>你将油画调包  然后吞掉了
<32-9,BECKETT>You switched out the paintings, you pocketed

899
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,840
<32-9,BECKETT>芬克给你买画的钱
<32-9,BECKETT>The money that Fink gave you to buy it.

900
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,190
<32-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>是芬克  他指使的我
<32-10,DARIUS LANGLEY>It was Fink. He manipulated me.

901
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,750
<32-11,BECKETT>不  你说谎
<32-11,BECKETT>No, that is just a lie.

902
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,310
<32-11,BECKETT>你还说了一个谎  你的名字
<32-11,BECKETT>And you know what else is a lie? Your name.

903
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,510
<32-11,BECKETT>达里斯·兰利是你的室友
<32-11,BECKETT>Darius Langley is your roommate.

904
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,190
<32-12,CASTLE>很聪明  用他的身份在画廊找工作
<32-12,CASTLE>Pretty smart, using his identity to land a job at the gallery.

905
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,990
<32-12,CASTLE>不过我猜你有两次造假罪
<32-12,CASTLE>Though I guess it'd be pretty tough to get hired

906
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,320
<32-12,CASTLE>很难再找到工作
<32-12,CASTLE>With two felony counts of counterfeiting, though,

907
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,550
<33-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>是吗  乔治
<33-2,JEREMY PRESWICK>Isn't it, George?

908
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,100
<32-13,BECKETT>你的档案挺厚的  海勒先生
<32-13,BECKETT>You've got quite a rap sheet, Mr. Heller.

909
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,010
<32-14,CASTLE>如果再次入罪  你就要被关很久啦
<32-14,CASTLE>Hmm. One more strike, you go away for a long time.

910
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,630
<32-15,BECKETT>所以当普瑞斯威科知道真相时
<32-15,BECKETT>Which is why you couldn't afford Prestwick calling the cops

911
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,280
<32-15,BECKETT>你知道不能让他报警  于是向他开枪
<32-15,BECKETT>When he found out the truth, and so you shot him.

912
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,090
<32-15,BECKETT>当他倒下时  你又朝芬克开枪
<32-15,BECKETT>And then when he went down, you shot Fink as well.

913
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,550
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>你以为你可以告我谋杀吗
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>You think you're gonna pin this murder on me?

914
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,280
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>不可能
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>No way.

915
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,140
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>你没证据
<32-16,GEORGE HELLER>You don't got jack.

916
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,880
<32-17,BECKETT>仔细看
<32-17,BECKETT>Read carefully.

917
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,950
<32-17,BECKETT>你贿赂了管理员  两次
<32-17,BECKETT>You bribed the super...  Twice.

918
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,780
<32-17,BECKETT>第二次是莱恩和埃斯波西托警探
<32-17,BECKETT>And the second time was four hours after

919
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,700
<32-17,BECKETT>带普瑞斯威科到画廊的四小时后
<32-17,BECKETT>Detectives Ryan and Esposito brought Prestwick to the gallery

920
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,650
<32-17,BECKETT>你意识到他已经失忆
<32-17,BECKETT>And you realized that he had lost his memory.

921
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,480
<32-17,BECKETT>你把枪放在那里的
<32-17,BECKETT>You planted the gun.

922
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,300
<32-18,CASTLE>挥棒落空
<32-18,CASTLE>Swing and a miss.

923
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,440
<32-18,CASTLE>三振出局
<32-18,CASTLE>Strike three. You're out.

924
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,090
<33-1,RYAN>这真美
<33-1,RYAN>Ah, it's a beaut.

925
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,850
<33-3,BECKETT>-不是吗  -我特别喜欢手指印
<33-3,BECKETT>- Isn't it? - I especially love the fingerprint.

926
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,240
<33-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>我也是  虽然我不记得了
<33-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>Me, too.  Even if I can't remember,

927
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,020
<33-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>但仍能感觉到  这是我生活的一部分
<33-4,JEREMY PRESWICK>It still somehow feels a part of me.

928
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,660
<33-5,EMMA CARNES>杰里
<33-5,EMMA CARNES>Hey, Jer.

929
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,370
<33-5,EMMA CARNES>准备好走了吗
<33-5,EMMA CARNES>Ready to rock?

930
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,690
<33-6,JEREMY PRESWICK>谢谢你能来
<33-6,JEREMY PRESWICK>Thanks for coming.

931
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,980
<33-7,EMMA CARNES>还记得露西吗
<33-7,EMMA CARNES>You remember Lucy?

932
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:02,560
<33-9,BECKETT>-不  -她肯定记得你了
<33-9,BECKETT>- No. - She certainly remembers you.

933
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,430
<33-10,JEREMY PRESWICK>谢谢  伙计们
<33-10,JEREMY PRESWICK>Well, hey, thanks, guys.

934
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:08,130
<33-10,JEREMY PRESWICK>因为你们  因谋杀被也没那么糟
