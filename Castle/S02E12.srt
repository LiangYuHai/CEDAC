<1-2,SHEILA BLANE>如果那个女孩毁了你的婚礼
<1-2,SHEILA BLANE>If that girl ruins your wedding--

<1-4,LAURIE HILL>若昨晚我也像她那样喝那么多香槟
<1-4,LAURIE HILL>If I had as much champagne as she did last night,

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,320
<1-8,KYRA>也不在洗手间
<1-8,KYRA>She's not in the bathroom.

32

<1-9,SHEILA BLAINE>看她的礼服还在不在
<1-9,SHEILA BLAINE>Go and see if her dress is still here.

33
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,170
<2-1,CASTLE>绑结实点儿
<2-1,CASTLE>Make sure it's nice and tight.

<2-3,MARTHA>What on earth are you two doing?

36
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,030
<2-4,CASTLE>做研究
<2-4,CASTLE>Research.

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,160
<2-5,ALEXIS>老爸在下一章里写道  妮基·希特
<2-5,ALEXIS>Dad has Nikki Heat duct-taped to a chair

38
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,190
<2-5,ALEXIS>被胶带绑在了椅子上
<2-5,ALEXIS>in his next chapter,

39
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,630
<2-5,ALEXIS>他不知道该怎样让她逃脱
<2-5,ALEXIS>and he doesn't know how to get her out of it.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,160
<2-6,CASTLE>我想  最好的办法
<2-6,CASTLE>I thought, what better way to figure it out

41
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,030
<2-6,CASTLE>莫过于从她的角度来思考
<2-6,CASTLE>than to get into the mind of my character.

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,860
<2-6,CASTLE>我不知道
<2-6,CASTLE>I don't know.

43
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,690
<2-7,MARTHA>我觉得你完全可以凭想象力
<2-7,MARTHA>I suppose you could just use your imagination.

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,500
<2-8,CASTLE>我希望写逼真一点  还有手
<2-8,CASTLE>Well, I want it to be authentic. Hands.

47
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,020
<2-9,MARTHA>完了  说漏嘴了
<2-9,MARTHA>Oh, God. I can't believe I just said that.

48
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,530
<2-10,CASTLE>你们要去干嘛
<2-10,CASTLE>Where are you two off to?

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,420
<2-11,ALEXIS>奶奶要参加彩排  我想去看
<2-11,ALEXIS>Gram's got a dress rehearsal. I thought I'd go watch.

<2-12,MARTHA>是看我
<2-12,MARTHA>Watch me

<2-12,MARTHA>or watch the adorable delivery boy in the second act?

52
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,920
<2-13,ALEXIS>紧不紧
<2-13,ALEXIS>Too tight?

53
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,960
<2-14,CASTLE>非常好
<2-14,CASTLE>Perfect.

54
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,760
<2-15,ALEXIS>你确定要把嘴封上吗
<2-15,ALEXIS>And you're sure about your mouth?

55
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,930
<2-16,CASTLE>我说过了  要逼真
<2-16,CASTLE>Like I said, authentic.

56
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,160
<2-17,ALEXIS>可以就点头
<2-17,ALEXIS>Nod if you're okay.

57
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,130
<2-17,ALEXIS>好  出发  完事后可能会去购物
<2-17,ALEXIS>Okay. We're off, and after, we might go shopping.

58
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,090
<2-17,ALEXIS>所以
<2-17,ALEXIS>So...

59
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,990
<2-17,ALEXIS>你不介意  对吧
<2-17,ALEXIS>You don't mind, right?

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,750
<2-18,ALEXIS>别这样  老爸
<2-18,ALEXIS>Oh, come on, dad.

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
<2-18,ALEXIS>要是我不拿  你就不关心我了
<2-18,ALEXIS>We both know you'd have no respect for me if I didn't.

62
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,430
<2-18,ALEXIS>玩得愉快  祝你好运
<2-18,ALEXIS>Have fun and good luck.

63
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,130
<2-19,MARTHA>我不知道她从哪儿学的  真不知道
<2-19,MARTHA>I don't know where she gets it from. Honestly, I don't.

64
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,800
<2-20,ALEXIS>-再见  -再见
<2-20,ALEXIS>- Bye  - Adios.

65
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,660
<3-1,ESPOSITO>死者是苏菲·朗森  35岁
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Victim is Sophie Ronson, 35.

66
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,500
<3-1,ESPOSITO>从洛杉矶来参加婚礼
<3-1,ESPOSITO>She's in from LA for the wedding.

67
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,430
<3-2,BECKETT>是客人吗
<3-2,BECKETT>Was she a guest?

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,470
<3-3,ESPOSITO>不是  伴娘
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Mnh-mnh. Bridesmaid.

69
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,730
<3-4,ESPOSITO>朗森小姐没去做妆发
<3-4,ESPOSITO>The bride came looking

70
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,300
<3-4,ESPOSITO>新娘就过来查看
<3-4,ESPOSITO>when Ms. Ronson didn't show up for her hair and makeup.

71
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,700
<3-4,ESPOSITO>结果在大衣橱里发现了她
<3-4,ESPOSITO>Found her stuffed in that armoire.

72
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,970
<3-5,BECKETT>有什么发现
<3-5,BECKETT>What do you see?

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,100
<3-6,LANIE>初步分析死者为窒息而死
<3-6,LANIE>Preliminary cause is asphyxiation.

74
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,070
<3-6,LANIE>从气管的扭曲形状来看
<3-6,LANIE>And from the way her windpipe is crushed,

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,180
<3-6,LANIE>凶手是从死者身后行凶
<3-6,LANIE>I'd say the killer choked her from behind.

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,310
<3-6,LANIE>咽喉处有挫伤
<3-6,LANIE>We've got contusions on her throat,

77
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,420
<3-6,LANIE>一只耳环不见踪影
<3-6,LANIE>one of her earrings is missing.

78
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,780
<3-6,LANIE>像是被从耳垂扯下
<3-6,LANIE>It looks like it was yanked from her lobe.

79
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,380
<3-7,ESPOSITO>搜遍了房间  也没发现耳环
<3-7,ESPOSITO>We searched the room. The earring's not here.

80
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,110
<3-8,BECKETT>通知鉴证组  打印出耳环的照片
<3-8,BECKETT>Get CSU to print out a picture

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,420
<3-8,BECKETT>这样同事可在整个酒店范围搜寻
<3-8,BECKETT>so that uniforms can start searching the hotel.

82
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,930
<3-9,ESPOSITO>好的
<3-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

83
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,120
<3-10,BECKETT>死亡时间
<3-10,BECKETT>Time of death?

84
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,150
<3-11,LANIE>从室温和尸斑来看
<3-11,LANIE>Based on temperature and lividity,

85
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,350
<3-11,LANIE>我估计是凌晨三点到五点之间
<3-11,LANIE>I'd say between 3:00 and 5:00 am this morning.

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
<3-12,BECKETT>-谢谢  -不客气
<3-12,BECKETT>- Thank you. - Hmm.

87
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,850
<3-13,LANIE>去和酒店保安人员谈谈
<3-13,LANIE>Let's talk to hotel security.

88
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,880
<3-14,BECKETT>我要看监视录像
<3-14,BECKETT>I want to see surveillance tapes

89
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,620
<3-14,BECKETT>所有登记入住的客人名单
<3-14,BECKETT>and a list of all registered hotel guests.

90
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,620
<3-14,BECKETT>死者手机及房间电话的通话记录
<3-14,BECKETT>And get records for her room phone and her cell.

91
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,050
<3-15,ESPOSITO>马上去办
<3-15,ESPOSITO>I'm on it.

92
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,290
<3-16,RYAN>酒店方面说只给了死者一张房卡
<3-16,RYAN>Hotel says only one key card was issued to the victim.

93
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,590
<3-16,RYAN>这张卡最后一次使用是在凌晨3点18分
<3-16,RYAN>It was last used to enter the victim's room at 3:18 am.

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,620
<3-17,BECKETT>和死亡时间吻合
<3-17,BECKETT>Okay, well, that coincides with time of death.

95
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,920
<3-17,BECKETT>新娘和新郎在哪儿
<3-17,BECKETT>Where are the bride and groom?

96
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,160
<3-18,RYAN>婚礼套房  在大厅尽头
<3-18,RYAN>Bridal suite at the end of the hall.

97
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,120
<3-18,RYAN>叫格雷格和凯拉
<3-18,RYAN>Uh, Greg And Kyra.

98
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,160
<3-19,BECKETT>让同事召集参加婚礼的所有客人
<3-19,BECKETT>Okay, have uniforms assemble the wedding guests

99
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,130
<3-19,BECKETT>到酒吧间  接受询问
<3-19,BECKETT>in the bar to be interviewed.

100
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,130
<3-20,RYAN>卡塞尔在哪儿
<3-20,RYAN>Where's Castle?

101
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,060
<3-21,BECKETT>不知道  调查伴娘的死因
<3-21,BECKETT>I don't know. Figured the death of a bridesmaid

102
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,130
<3-21,BECKETT>正适合他干
<3-21,BECKETT>would be right up his alley.

103
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,740
<3-22,RYAN>他可能听到"婚礼" 就临阵退缩了
<3-22,RYAN>He heard "wedding" and probably got cold feet?

104
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,980
<3-22,RYAN>最后见到苏菲是什么时候
<3-22,RYAN>When was the last time that you saw Sophie?

105
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,450
<3-22,RYAN>在昨晚的预演晚宴上
<3-22,RYAN>At the rehearsal dinner last night.

106
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,590
<3-22,RYAN>我好像都没跟她说话
<3-22,RYAN>I don't even think I talked to her.

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,350
<5-1,BECKETT>她为了我们  一路赶过来
<5-1,BECKETT>She came all this way for us,

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,210
<5-2,KYRA>我甚至都没跟她打招呼
<5-2,KYRA>and I don't think I even said hello.

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,550
<5-3,GREG>这不是你的错  凯拉  昨天太忙乱了
<5-3,GREG>It's not your fault, Kyra. It was a crazy day.

110
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
<5-4,KYRA>我去睡觉后  你们聊过吗
<5-4,KYRA>Did you talk to her after I went up to bed?

111
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,490
<5-5,GREG>没有  你知道泰迪叔叔这个人的
<5-5,GREG>No. You know how uncle Teddy is.

112
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,000
<5-5,GREG>在没喝倒之前他是不会放我走的
<5-5,GREG>He wouldn't let me leave without doing tequila shots.

113
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,530
<5-5,GREG>大约1点的时候  我溜回了房间
<5-5,GREG>I escaped up to my room around 1:00.

114
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,790
<5-5,GREG>我不知道苏菲是否还在酒吧间
<5-5,GREG>I'm not sure if Sophie was still at the bar.

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,430
<5-6,BECKETT>昨晚你们不在同一间房吗
<5-6,BECKETT>The two of you weren't in the same room last night?

116
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,660
<5-7,KYRA>不在
<5-7,KYRA>No.

117
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,440
<5-8,GREG>婚礼前见新娘会带来霉运
<5-8,GREG>It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.

118
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,340
<5-9,BECKETT>关于苏菲  我还有些问题
<5-9,BECKETT>Is there anything else you can tell me about Sophie?

119
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,870
<5-9,BECKETT>她是否在恋爱  有没有仇人
<5-9,BECKETT>Was she in a relationship? Did she have any enemies?

120
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,340
<5-9,BECKETT>我不清楚
<5-9,BECKETT>I don't know.

121
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,310
<5-10,KYRA>她在洛杉矶  我们并不是十分亲密
<5-10,KYRA>She lived in LA, and we-- we were never super close.

122
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,020
<5-11,GREG>是苏菲介绍我们认识的
<5-11,GREG>Sophie introduced us.

123
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,420
<5-11,GREG>因为她  我们才能在一起
<5-11,GREG>She's the reason we're together.

124
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,350
<5-12,KYRA>所以我们准备婚礼的时候
<5-12,KYRA>So when we were planning the wedding,

125
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,920
<5-12,KYRA>就想到应该把她请来
<5-12,KYRA>we thought she should be there.

126

<5-12,KYRA>谁会做这样的事呢
<5-12,KYRA>Who would do something like this?

<6-4,ESPOSITO>很确定凶手不在其中
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Seemed pretty sure there wasn't a killer among them,

135
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,270
<6-4,ESPOSITO>不过还是给了我名单

<6-4,ESPOSITO>好消息是  电梯的摄像头都在运作
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Good news is, the elevators are all wired. Bad news is,

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,360
<6-4,ESPOSITO>坏消息是楼梯和走廊的没有
<6-4,ESPOSITO>the stairwells and hallways aren't.

<6-11,CASTLE>是的  是的  没错
<6-11,CASTLE>Yes. Yes, it is.

146
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,970
<6-11,CASTLE>死者是伴娘
<6-11,CASTLE>So a bridesmaid, huh?

147
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,500
<6-11,CASTLE>怎么回事
<6-11,CASTLE>What happened?

148
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,400
<7-1,CASTLE>不会是穿着礼服被杀害的吧
<7-1,CASTLE>Wouldn't get caught dead in that dress?

149
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,370
<7-2,RYAN>其实也没那么差劲
<7-2,RYAN>They're actually not that bad.

150
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,920
<7-2,RYAN>是条淡紫色的雪纺纱裙
<7-2,RYAN>A subtle mauve chiffon.

151
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,580
<7-3,ESPOSITO>兄弟  真的吗  淡紫色的
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Dude, really? Mauve?

152
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,010
<7-4,RYAN>怎么啦  我有姐妹的
<7-4,RYAN>What? I have sisters.

153
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,950
<7-4,RYAN>你该看看她们的礼服  奇丑无比
<7-4,RYAN>You should've seen their dresses--hideous.

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,950
<7-5,CASTLE>伴娘的礼服本来就该丑一些
<7-5,CASTLE>Ah, bridesmaid dresses are supposed to be hideous.

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,980
<7-6,ESPOSITO>是吗  为什么
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Really, why?

156
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,920
<7-7,BECKETT>那样的话  对比起来新娘就漂亮多啦
<7-7,BECKETT>So that the bride looks more beautiful in comparison.

157
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,950
<7-8,CASTLE>看到没
<7-8,CASTLE>Ah, see?

158
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,720
<7-8,CASTLE>每个女人都会想象她的婚礼
<7-8,CASTLE>Not a woman alive who doesn't think about her wedding day,

159
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,920
<7-8,CASTLE>连凯特·贝克特也不例外
<7-8,CASTLE>not even Kate Beckett.

160
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,890
<7-8,CASTLE>别告诉我  你从没从杂志上剪下
<7-8,CASTLE>Tell me you never tore a picture of a wedding gown

161
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,360
<7-9,BECKETT>中意的婚纱
<7-9,BECKETT>out of a magazine.

162
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,440
<7-9,BECKETT>我从没从杂志上剪过婚纱
<7-9,BECKETT>I've never torn a picture of a wedding gown out of a magazine.

163
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,460
<7-10,CASTLE>你撒谎
<7-10,CASTLE>You're lying.

164
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,300
<7-10,CASTLE>-她在撒谎  -赞成
<7-10,CASTLE>- She's lying. - Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,610
<7-11,RYAN>倒霉的新娘是哪位
<7-11,RYAN>So who's the unlucky bride?

166
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,480
<7-13,RYAN>她叫
<7-13,RYAN>Uh, her name is...

167
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,090
<7-14,CASTLE>凯拉
<7-14,CASTLE>Kyra?

168
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,020
<7-15,KYRA>里克
<7-15,KYRA>Rick?

169
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,050
<7-15,KYRA>里克·卡塞尔
<7-15,KYRA>Rick Castle.

170
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,990
<7-16,BECKETT>你们认识
<7-16,BECKETT>You two know each other?

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,620
<7-17,CASTLE>可不仅仅是认识
<7-17,CASTLE>That would be an understatement.

176
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,290
<8-1,KYRA>我看到报道说  你跟着警方做事
<8-1,KYRA>I read somewhere that you were working with the police,

177
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,800
<8-1,KYRA>但做梦也想不到
<8-1,KYRA>But I-I never would've expected to...

178
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,390
<8-1,KYRA>多久没见了
<8-1,KYRA>How long has it been?

179
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,100
<8-3,KYRA>-太久了  -你一点都没变
<8-3,KYRA>- Too long. - You look exactly the same.

180
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,300
<8-4,CASTLE>你变漂亮了
<8-4,CASTLE>And you've improved.

181
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,100
<8-5,KYRA>你总是很会说话
<8-5,KYRA>You always did know how to turn a phrase.

182
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,670
<8-5,KYRA>这真是
<8-5,KYRA>This is...

183
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
<8-5,KYRA>太像做梦了
<8-5,KYRA>So surreal.

184
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,010
<8-5,KYRA>今天是我结婚的日子
<8-5,KYRA>It's my wedding day,

185
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,880
<8-5,KYRA>而你却出现了
<8-5,KYRA>and you...show up.

186
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,650
<8-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  蕾妮有新发现
<8-6,BECKETT>Castle, Lanie's got something for us.

187
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,650
<8-7,CASTLE>我会过去的
<8-7,CASTLE>I'll catch up.

188
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,330
<8-8,BECKETT>行  好吧
<8-8,BECKETT>Hmm. Okay.

189
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,230
<9-1,BECKETT>发现了什么
<9-1,BECKETT>What'd you find?

190
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,130
<9-2,LANIE>我把死者翻过来时
<9-2,LANIE>Once I turned her over,

191
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,260
<9-2,LANIE>看到了她背部上方的这些擦伤
<9-2,LANIE>I saw these abrasions across her upper back.

192
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,330
<9-2,LANIE>肯定是死前造成的
<9-2,LANIE>They were definitely made before she died,

193
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,870
<9-2,LANIE>可能是在挣扎的过程中造成的
<9-2,LANIE>probably during the struggle.

194
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
<9-3,BECKETT>是什么造成的呢
<9-3,BECKETT>Any idea what made them?

195
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,240
<9-4,LANIE>不知道  不过伤痕的形状很奇怪
<9-4,LANIE>No, but there's an odd shape to the wounds.

196
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,740
<9-4,LANIE>回到实验室就能知道了
<9-4,LANIE>I'll have a better idea once I get her back to the lab.

197
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,670
<9-5,BECKETT>好的
<9-5,BECKETT>Okay.

198
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
<9-6,LANIE>婚礼套房情况如何
<9-6,LANIE>So how's everything going in the bridal suite?

199
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,410
<9-6,LANIE>没有如期举行婚礼
<9-6,LANIE>Not the day they had planned.

200
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,450
<9-7,BECKETT>是啊  不过有神秘嘉宾
<9-7,BECKETT>Yeah, or the surprise guest.

201
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,980
<9-7,BECKETT>显然卡塞尔和新娘之间有段历史
<9-7,BECKETT>Apparently Castle has a history with the bride.

202
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,580
<9-8,LANIE>古代史  现代史  还是爱情史
<9-8,LANIE>Ancient, modern or sexual?

203
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,550
<9-9,BECKETT>看起来都有
<9-9,BECKETT>Seems like all of the above.

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,860
<9-10,LANIE>你不介意吗
<9-10,LANIE>You're okay with that?

205
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,020
<9-11,BECKETT>不介意啊  我为什么要介意
<9-11,BECKETT>Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

206
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,160
<9-12,BECKETT>有消息随时告诉我
<9-12,BECKETT>Just keep me posted on the labs.

207
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,930
<9-13,LANIE>那个说过婚姻制度
<9-13,LANIE>So what happened to the girl

208
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,970
<9-14,CASTLE>属于侏罗纪的女孩怎么结婚了
<9-14,CASTLE>who said that marriage was a Jurassic institution?

209
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,530
<9-15,KYRA>她长大了
<9-15,KYRA>She grew up.

210
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,170
<9-16,CASTLE>那是不是也意味着新郎也是个成年人
<9-16,CASTLE>Mm. Does that mean the groom is a grown-up, too?

211
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,800
<9-16,CASTLE>成天工作不休息
<9-16,CASTLE>All work and no play.

212
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,670
<9-17,KYRA>不是  他适当休息
<9-17,KYRA>No. He plays just enough.

213
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,780
<9-18,CASTLE>他真幸运
<9-18,CASTLE>He's a lucky man.

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,950
<9-19,KYRA>除了今天
<9-19,KYRA>Except today.

224
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,970
<9-26,GREG>他们认为凶手还在酒店里吗
<9-26,GREG>Do they think the murderer is still in the hotel?

225
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,170
<9-27,CASTLE>那得看这次事件是意外
<9-27,CASTLE>Well, that depends on whether the attack was random

226
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,140
<9-27,CASTLE>还是熟人所为
<9-27,CASTLE>or someone she knew.

227
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,870
<9-28,KYRA>你认为凶手可能在客人当中
<9-28,KYRA>So you think one of the guests could've killed her?

228
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,910
<9-29,CASTLE>警方必须考虑各种可能性
<9-29,CASTLE>We have to consider every possibility.

229
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,440
<9-30,GREG>抱歉我们得先离开下

287
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,400
<12-10,CASTLE>小巧的数码相机里应该就有
<12-10,CASTLE>on these handy-dandy digital video cameras.

288
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,740
<13-1,MIKE WEITZ>我们当时都在逃命呢
<13-1,MIKE WEITZ>There we are, running for our lives, right...

<13-3,MIKE WEITZ>苏菲的目光转向麦克
<13-3,MIKE WEITZ>and that's sophie looking away from us.

<13-4,CASTLE>歪歪倒倒走过走廊
<13-4,CASTLE>Serpentined down the hallway.

292
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,610
<13-5,MIKE WEITZ>就在那时  吉斯决定
<13-5,MIKE WEITZ>And that's when-- that's when Keith decides...

293
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,740
<13-6,MIKE WEITZ>得慢点走
<13-6,MIKE WEITZ>he's gonna slow him down a little bit.

294
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,650
<13-6,MIKE WEITZ>他拿起一个灭火器
<13-6,MIKE WEITZ>So he grabs a fire extinguisher...

295
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,480
<13-7,RYAN>-谁在别人演讲时接电话呢  -就是 没礼貌

<13-8,CASTLE>他喊道  我看不见  我看不见啦
<13-8,CASTLE>And he's yelling, "I can't see! I can't see!"

297
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,720
<13-9,ESPOSITO>她是跟谁通话呢

<13-10,BECKETT>暂停
<13-10,BECKETT>Pause that.

299
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,060
<13-10,BECKETT>这不是很奇怪吗   麦克演讲的中途
<13-10,BECKETT>Does anyone else find it odd that Sophie would leave

300
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,890
<13-10,BECKETT>苏菲就离开了
<13-10,BECKETT>in the middle of Mike's speech?

301
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,000
<13-11,ESPOSITO>也许打电话的人想要见她呢
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Maybe whoever called wanted to meet.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,310
<13-12,CASTLE>但会是谁呢
<13-12,CASTLE>Yeah, but who?

<14-4,RYAN>当初基本是卖大麻和可卡因
<14-4,RYAN>Mostly weed and coke back in the day.

316

317
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,630
<14-4,RYAN>就海扁了对方
<14-4,RYAN>who was trying to muscle in on his turf.

<15-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔的书都只是他
<15-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, most of that book is just a result

332
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,120
<15-9,BECKETT>胡思乱想的结果
<15-9,BECKETT>of Castle's overactive imagination.

333
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,030
<15-10,KYRA>你这么称呼他真有意思
<15-10,KYRA>It's funny that you call him that.

<15-10,KYRA>写的书刚开始畅销
<15-10,KYRA>fresh off his first best seller.

337

<16-2,ESPOSITO>我们知道你在酒店见过苏菲
<16-2,ESPOSITO>We know you met Sophie at the hotel, Boyd.

343
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,550
<16-2,ESPOSITO>几个钟头后  她就死了
<16-2,ESPOSITO>A couple hours later, she turns up dead.

344
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,420
<16-2,ESPOSITO>你不该给个交待吗
<16-2,ESPOSITO>You want to tell us how that happened?

345
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,220
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>我们在公园见的面
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>She met me in the park.

346
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,920
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>我有个熟人跟她推荐来我这买货
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>We had a mutual acquaintance who recommended my services.

347
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,290
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>她知道她要什么我都能给
<16-3,BOYD GAMBLE>She knew I could get her what she needed.

348
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,330
<16-4,RYAN>为什么卖了毒品还不放手
<16-4,RYAN>Why didn't you just sell her the drugs and be done with it?

349
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,990
<16-4,RYAN>怎么还去了酒店
<16-4,RYAN>Why did you show up at the hotel?

350
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,030
<16-5,BOYD GAMBLE>因为她要的东西很特别
<16-5,BOYD GAMBLE>Because she needed a specialty item.

351
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,000
<16-5,BOYD GAMBLE>当时我身上没货  说好拿到货就打给她
<16-5,BOYD GAMBLE>I didn't have any on me, so I told her I'd call her when I did.

352
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,070
<16-6,ESPOSITO>什么特别的货
<16-6,ESPOSITO>What specialty item?

353
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,070
<16-7,BOYD GAMBLE>氟硝西泮
<16-7,BOYD GAMBLE>Flunitrazepam.

354
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,470
<16-8,RYAN>迷药
<16-8,RYAN>Roofies?

355
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,470
<17-1,BECKETT>伴娘要迷药做什么
<17-1,BECKETT>Why would a bridesmaid need roofies?

356
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,410
<17-2,CASTLE>想占帅哥的便宜
<17-2,CASTLE>You want to take advantage of a guy,

357
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,980
<17-2,CASTLE>迷晕他基本就无法实现目的了
<17-2,CASTLE>knocking him unconscious kind of defeats the purpose.

358
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,770
<17-2,CASTLE>最佳方案  说句话就成
<17-2,CASTLE>The best way--just ask.

359
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,240
<17-2,CASTLE>我会帮你办好的
<17-2,CASTLE>I'll take care of it for you.

360
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,620
<17-2,CASTLE>你好  希拉
<17-2,CASTLE>Hello, Sheila.

361
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,920
<17-2,CASTLE>理查德
<17-2,CASTLE>Richard.

362
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,120
<17-3,SHEILA BLAINE>我想你正是这场混乱的罪魁祸首
<17-3,SHEILA BLAINE>Figures you'd be at the heart of this mess.

363
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
<17-4,CASTLE>贝克特探长  这位是希拉·布莱恩
<17-4,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, this is Sheila Blaine,

364
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,690
<17-4,CASTLE>新娘的母亲
<17-4,CASTLE>mother of the bride.

365
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,960
<17-4,CASTLE>最后我竟然没有无家可归
<17-4,CASTLE>So I guess I didn't end up homeless or teaching

366
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,630
<17-4,CASTLE>也没在新罕布什尔州的三流大学教书
<17-4,CASTLE>at a third-rate college in New Hampshire after all.

367
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,400
<17-5,SHEILA BLAINE>一切还有待时间去验证
<17-5,SHEILA BLAINE>There's still time.

368
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
<17-6,CASTLE>我总会想起我们的特别谈话
<17-6,CASTLE>I've missed our special talks.

369
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,700
<17-6,CASTLE>希拉不喜欢搞艺术的穷小子
<17-6,CASTLE>Sheila didn't approve of struggling artists.

370
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,510
<17-6,CASTLE>你肯定大爱格雷格吧  他家有钱吧
<17-6,CASTLE>You must like Greg, though. He's from money, right?

371
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,610
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>理查德  其实从来和钱无关
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>It was never about the money, Richard.

372
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,140
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>只有关优点
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>It was about character.

373
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,880
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>如果你有优点的话  早就知道这点了
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>And you would know that if you had any.

374
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,020
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>厉害
<17-7,SHEILA BLAINE>Wow.

375
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,980
<17-8,BECKETT>想象下  如果你们没分手
<17-8,BECKETT>Just imagine-- if things had worked out...

376
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,750
<17-8,BECKETT>你得和她一起过感恩节了
<17-8,BECKETT>you'd be spending thanksgivings with her.

377
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,020
<17-9,BECKETT>贝克特  好  很好
<17-9,BECKETT>Beckett. Okay, great.

378
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,790
<17-9,BECKETT>找到麦克了
<17-9,BECKETT>They think they found Mike.

379
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,990
<18-1,MIKE WEITZ>救命啊
<18-1,MIKE WEITZ>Help!

380
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,130
<18-1,MIKE WEITZ>有人吗  救命
<18-1,MIKE WEITZ>Anybody! Help!

381
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,740
<18-2,BECKETT>怀特先生  麦克
<18-2,BECKETT>Mr. Weitz? Mike.

382
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,010
<18-3,MIKE WEITZ>苏菲那个臭女人呢  我要杀了她
<18-3,MIKE WEITZ>Where's that bitch Sophie? I'll kill her.

383
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,510
<18-4,CASTLE>时间  完全不对
<18-4,CASTLE>Timing--very poor.

384
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,010
<18-5,BECKETT>怎么了
<18-5,BECKETT>What happened?

385
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,380
<18-6,MIKE WEITZ>那个女人给我下了药
<18-6,MIKE WEITZ>That little freak drugged me.

386
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,120
<18-6,MIKE WEITZ>那么  麦克
<18-6,MIKE WEITZ>All right, Mike.

387
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,660
<19-1,BECKETT>说说昨晚和苏菲之间发生了什么
<19-1,BECKETT>Walk me through what happened with you and Sophie last night.

388
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
<19-2,MIKE WEITZ>她勾引的我
<19-2,MIKE WEITZ>Mm. She came on to me is what happened.

389
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,200
<19-2,MIKE WEITZ>跟我调情  还给了我杯酒
<19-2,MIKE WEITZ>Acted all flirty, brought me a drink.

390
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,530
<19-3,CASTLE>下了迷药的酒
<19-3,CASTLE>A drink spiked with roofies.

391
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,870
<19-4,MIKE WEITZ>神经吧
<19-4,MIKE WEITZ>Yeah, nuts, right?

392
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,930
<19-4,MIKE WEITZ>谁会给男人下药  女人说一句话就行
<19-4,MIKE WEITZ>I mean, who roofies a guy? All a girl has to do is ask.

393
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,800
<19-5,CASTLE>就是
<19-5,CASTLE>Mm.

394
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,740
<19-6,BECKETT>你们俩在一起过吗
<19-6,BECKETT>Did the two of you have history?

395
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,040
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>没有  我们去年
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>No. I mean, I-I saw her last year

396
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,110
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>在格雷格和凯拉订婚派对上见过
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>at Greg and Kyra's engagement party.

397
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,540
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>男人看见她  都会移不开目光的
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>She was definitely the kind of girl you noticed.

398
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,410
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>不过说实话  我们没说过几句话
<19-7,MIKE WEITZ>But, uh, no, I-I don't think we so much as even talked.

399
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,110
<19-8,CASTLE>知道她为什么要对你下药吗
<19-8,CASTLE>Any idea why she'd want to drug you?

400
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,450
<19-9,MIKE WEITZ>不知道
<19-9,MIKE WEITZ>No clue.

401
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,220
<19-10,BECKETT>她的样子有没有生气或是紧张恐惧
<19-10,BECKETT>Did she seem angry, nervous or scared?

402
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,260
<19-11,MIKE WEITZ>没有  她像是心意已定
<19-11,MIKE WEITZ>No. She seemed... determined.

403
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,290
<19-11,MIKE WEITZ>我早该知道馅饼砸不中我的
<19-11,MIKE WEITZ>Guess I should've known it was too good to be true, huh?

404
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,800
<19-12,BECKETT>如果想到什么  请通知警方
<19-12,BECKETT>If you can think of anything else, let us know.

405
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,300
<19-13,MIKE WEITZ>好的
<19-13,MIKE WEITZ>Okay.

406
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,700
<19-14,BECKETT>苏菲昨晚到底意欲何为
<19-14,BECKETT>What was Sophie up to last night?

407
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,240
<19-15,CASTLE>她中途出去拿迷药
<19-15,CASTLE>She went out of her way to get those drugs.

408
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,610
<19-15,CASTLE>肯定早有预谋
<19-15,CASTLE>She definitely had a plan.

409
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,470
<19-16,BECKETT>迷晕麦克  把他关在衣橱里
<19-16,BECKETT>To roofie Mike and lock him in a closet?

410
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,310
<19-16,BECKETT>到底是什么诡异计划呢
<19-16,BECKETT>What kind of a bizarre plan is that?

411
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,610
<19-17,CASTLE>也许
<19-17,CASTLE>Maybe...

412
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,610
<19-17,CASTLE>我也不知道
<19-17,CASTLE>No, I got nothing.

413
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,980
<19-18,RYAN>兄弟  吃的  快吃  饿死了

<19-18,RYAN>What is that? Thanks.

415
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,350
<19-19,BECKETT>你们在干嘛
<19-19,BECKETT>What are you guys doing?

<19-23,BECKETT>You know what else is incredible? Hmm?

419
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,690
<19-24,BECKETT>一旦开始调查死者的私生活
<19-24,BECKETT>How much information we're gonna find

420
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,190
<19-24,BECKETT>拿到的信息量也很赞
<19-24,BECKETT>once we start investigating our victim's life.

421
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,690
<19-24,BECKETT>自苏菲·朗森的飞机抵达纽约
<19-24,BECKETT>I want to know everything about Sophie Ronson

<19-24,BECKETT>to the moment she was found dead--

424
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,060
<19-24,BECKETT>跟谁通电话  做了什么  在哪里吃饭
<19-24,BECKETT>Who she called, what she did and where she ate.

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,300
<20-2,CASTLE>会没人去找你
<20-2,CASTLE>where no one would think to look for you?

<20-7,KYRA>那是他擅长的
<20-7,KYRA>He's good at that.

440
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,410
<20-7,KYRA>所以  要是你不结婚
<20-7,KYRA>So if you don't get married,

441
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,650
<20-7,KYRA>这不过是块普通蛋糕了
<20-7,KYRA>is it just a regular old cake?

442
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,580
<20-8,CASTLE>这个还是结婚蛋糕
<20-8,CASTLE>It's still wedding cake.

<20-8,CASTLE>多层蛋糕  插花  摆在舞会大厅
<20-8,CASTLE>It's tiered, cut flowers, it's in a ballroom.

<20-9,KYRA>如果今天一切按计划走
<20-9,KYRA>If things had gone as planned today,

445
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,320
<20-9,KYRA>此时此刻  我应该
<20-9,KYRA>I would be twirling around

446
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,890
<20-9,KYRA>手携夫君翩翩起舞
<20-9,KYRA>on the dance floor with my husband right about now.

447
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,530
<20-10,CASTLE>还记得我们最后一次跳舞吗
<20-10,CASTLE>Do you remember the last time we danced?

448
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,400
<20-11,KYRA>在中央车站的大钟下面
<20-11,KYRA>Under the clock at Grand Central Station.

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,010
<20-12,CASTLE>你去肯尼迪机场赶一趟飞伦敦的航班
<20-12,CASTLE>You were on your way to JFK to catch a flight to London.

450
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,080
<20-13,KYRA>你本该也跟着去的
<20-13,KYRA>You were supposed to follow me.

451
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,510
<20-14,CASTLE>但你说你需要空间
<20-14,CASTLE>You said you needed space.

452
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,810
<20-15,KYRA>可我没说需要无限的空间
<20-15,KYRA>I didn't mean forever.

453
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,420
<20-15,KYRA>反正婚礼你都经历过了
<20-15,KYRA>So you've done all of this before.

454
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,020
<20-16,CASTLE>两次了
<20-16,CASTLE>Twice.

455
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,830
<20-17,KYRA>当时  你总认为那个她是真爱吗
<20-17,KYRA>And each time, did you think that she was the one?

456
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,960
<20-18,CASTLE>当时看来  结婚是正确的选择
<20-18,CASTLE>It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.

457
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
<20-19,KYRA>可事实上并非如此  对吗
<20-19,KYRA>But it wasn't, was it?

458
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,740
<20-20,KYRA>有女孩会认为今天的事是个预兆
<20-20,KYRA>Some girls would think what happened today is a sign.

459
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,510
<20-21,CASTLE>你是说谋杀案
<20-21,CASTLE>The murder?

460
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,170
<20-22,KYRA>还有你的出现
<20-22,KYRA>And you.

461
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,280
<20-22,KYRA>卡塞尔
<20-22,KYRA>Castle.

462
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,320
<20-23,BECKETT>我们准备走了  你要搭便车吗
<20-23,BECKETT>We're on our way. I thought you might need a ride.

463
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,590
<20-24,KYRA>我要上楼了
<20-24,KYRA>I should go upstairs.

464
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,920
<20-24,KYRA>大家可能会找我
<20-24,KYRA>They'll be looking for me.

465
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,610
<20-25,CASTLE>来点蛋糕吗
<20-25,CASTLE>Cake?

466
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,810
<20-26,BECKETT>不用了  谢谢
<20-26,BECKETT>No, thank you.

467
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,480
<21-1,CASTLE>我们是在大学里认识的
<21-1,CASTLE>We met in college.

468
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,420
<21-1,CASTLE>在一起差不多三年
<21-1,CASTLE>We were together nearly three years.

469
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,690
<21-2,BECKETT>我又没有问
<21-2,BECKETT>I didn't ask.

470
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,120
<21-3,CASTLE>但是你心中充满问号
<21-3,CASTLE>Yes, you were not asking very loudly.

471
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,060
<21-4,BECKETT>她和你的两位前妻可不一样
<21-4,BECKETT>She's different from your ex-wives.

472
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,630
<21-5,CASTLE>怎么说
<21-5,CASTLE>What do you mean?

473
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,860
<21-6,BECKETT>她是踏实过日子的
<21-6,BECKETT>She's real.

474
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,930
<21-6,BECKETT>我并不觉得你喜欢这种类型
<21-6,BECKETT>I didn't think you went for real.

475
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,900
<21-6,BECKETT>分手让你很痛苦吧
<21-6,BECKETT>Tough breakup?

476
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,740
<21-7,CASTLE>很久以前的事了
<21-7,CASTLE>It was a long time ago.

477
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,820
<22-3,BECKETT>-你打电话给我了  -是的
<22-3,BECKETT>- You called? - Yes.

478
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,280
<22-4,LANIE>在死者背部的伤痕发现微量金属
<22-4,LANIE>I found traces of metal in the abrasions on Sophie's back.

479
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,320
<22-5,BECKETT>-是什么金属  -我也不清楚
<22-5,BECKETT>- What kind of metal? - I have no idea.

480
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
<22-6,LANIE>不过已经把样本送去联调局实验室了
<22-6,LANIE>But I sent a sample over to the FBI lab

481
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,190
<22-6,LANIE>看他们是否能缩小化学特性范围
<22-6,LANIE>to see if they can narrow down the chemical signature.

482
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,690
<22-6,LANIE>明天应该会有结果
<22-6,LANIE>We should have the results tomorrow.

483
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,230
<22-7,BECKETT>如果找到造成伤痕的凶器
<22-7,BECKETT>If I find the object that made the wounds,

484
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,030
<22-7,BECKETT>可以证明其吻合吗
<22-7,BECKETT>you'll be able to match it?

485
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,460
<22-8,LANIE>没问题
<22-8,LANIE>Absolutely.

486
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,960
<22-9,BECKETT>太好了  还有别的吗
<22-9,BECKETT>Great. Anything else?

487
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,800
<22-10,LANIE>看你是否坦白了
<22-10,LANIE>You tell me.

488
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,530
<22-11,BECKETT>坦白什么
<22-11,BECKETT>What?

489
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,070
<22-12,LANIE>别卖关子了  卡塞尔的旧情人
<22-12,LANIE>Don't "what" me. Castle's lost love.

490
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,640
<22-13,BECKETT>你在说什么
<22-13,BECKETT>Yeah. What about it?

491
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,070
<22-14,LANIE>还跟姐姐装蒜是吧
<22-14,LANIE>Girl, I'm gonna smack you.

492
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,880
<22-14,LANIE>你们每天形影不离地工作
<22-14,LANIE>You work side by side every day.

493
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,850
<22-14,LANIE>他以你为蓝本在书中大写性爱场景
<22-14,LANIE>He writes a sex scene in his book about you

494
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,780
<22-14,LANIE>看得我都要喝冰水降温
<22-14,LANIE>that had me reaching for ice water.

495
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,250
<22-14,LANIE>现在半路杀出来一个新娘旧情人
<22-14,LANIE>Now little Miss Bride shows up,

496
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,860
<22-14,LANIE>别告诉我你一点酸劲儿都没有
<22-14,LANIE>don't tell me you're not the least bit jealous.

497
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,890
<22-15,BECKETT>得了吧
<22-15,BECKETT>Oh, please.

498
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,460
<22-15,BECKETT>我看你在这里药水味闻太多了
<22-15,BECKETT>You have been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.

499
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,860
<22-16,LANIE>亲爱的  不识庐山真面目
<22-16,LANIE>Honey, just because you can't see what's going on

500
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,900
<22-16,LANIE>只缘身在此山中
<22-16,LANIE>doesn't mean everyone else doesn't see what's going on.

501
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,440
<22-17,BECKETT>闭嘴
<22-17,BECKETT>Shut up.

502
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,140
<22-18,LANIE>呵呵  我可是清楚的很
<22-18,LANIE>Mm-hmm. Cause I see it.

503
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,400
<22-18,LANIE>你看不见了  但是我可以
<22-18,LANIE>You may not, but I do.

504
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,510
<23-1,ESPOSITO>这段床上戏写得好详细啊
<23-1,ESPOSITO>There's a lot of detail in this love scene.

505
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,740
<23-3,BECKETT>你们不是应该在做背景调查吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Aren't you guys supposed to be running background checks?

506
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,410
<23-4,ESPOSITO>我们正在调查新娘的背景
<23-4,ESPOSITO>We are. On the bride.

507
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,150
<23-5,RYAN>昨天一整天  我都觉得
<23-5,RYAN>All day yesterday, I kept feeling like

508
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,950
<23-5,RYAN>凯拉·布莱恩这个名字似曾相识
<23-5,RYAN>I'd heard the name Kyra Blaine before.

509
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,520
<23-5,RYAN>果然想起  就在卡塞尔第二本书的致谢里
<23-5,RYAN>And then it hits me the dedication of Castle's second book.

510
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,950
<23-5,RYAN>《永不凋零的玫瑰》
<23-5,RYAN>"A Rose for Everafter."

511
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,360
<23-6,ESPOSITO>谨以此献给凯拉·布莱恩  星月因你无光
<23-6,ESPOSITO>"For Kyra Blaine, you make the stars shine."

512
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,800
<23-7,BECKETT>我不在  你们是不是互相编辫子玩儿
<23-7,BECKETT>When I'm not here, do you guys braid each other's hair

513
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
<23-7,BECKETT>还讨论乔纳斯兄弟[偶像乐队]中哪个最酷
<23-7,BECKETT>and debate who's the coolest Jonas Brother?

514
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,930
<23-8,ESPOSITO>没有  但既然你提起了  当然是尼克
<23-8,ESPOSITO>No, but it's totally Nick.

515
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,470
<23-10,ESPOSITO>-绝对是尼克最酷  -没错  凯文是最有才的一个
<23-10,ESPOSITO>- Absolutely Nick. - Yep. Kevin's the talented one.

516
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,510
<23-11,RYAN>尼克真可爱  乔呢
<23-11,RYAN>Yeah, Nick's the cute one. Joe?

517
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,010
<23-12,BECKETT>房卡
<23-12,BECKETT>The key card.

518
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,510
<23-13,CASTLE>迈克的房卡
<23-13,CASTLE>Mike's key card!

519
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,510
<23-14,BECKETT>酒店记录显示昨天凌晨2点
<23-14,BECKETT>Hotel records indicate that Mike's key card locks access of hotel room

520
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,180
<23-14,BECKETT>迈克的房卡被用过
<23-14,BECKETT>at 2:00 am yesterday morning.

521
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,180
<23-15,CASTLE>当时他正在储藏间里人事不省
<23-15,CASTLE>Only he was busy passed out in a supply closet

522
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,420
<23-15,CASTLE>胃里全是迷药
<23-15,CASTLE>with a bellyful of roofies.

523
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,720
<23-16,BECKETT>那究竟是谁进了迈克的房间
<23-16,BECKETT>So who swiped into Mike's room?

524
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,520
<24-1,BECKETT>迈克说他醒来时就发现门卡不见了
<24-1,BECKETT>Mike said his key card was missing when he woke up.

525
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,490
<24-2,CASTLE>很明显被苏菲偷了  但她为什么这么做
<24-2,CASTLE>Well, Sophie must have stolen it. But why?

526
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,360
<24-3,BECKETT>谢谢
<24-3,BECKETT>Thank you.

527
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,430
<24-4,CASTLE>迈克失踪时
<24-4,CASTLE>Didn't uniforms already search this room

528
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,900
<24-4,CASTLE>警队不是搜过这个房间了吗
<24-4,CASTLE>when he went missing?

529
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,870
<24-5,BECKETT>是  迈克说没发现有什么不对劲的
<24-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Mike said he didn't notice anything out of place.

530
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,240
<24-6,CASTLE>这房间到底有什么猫腻
<24-6,CASTLE>So what could be so important in this room

531
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,680
<24-6,CASTLE>要大费周章地对一个男人下药
<24-6,CASTLE>it'd be worth the trouble of drugging a man?

532
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,220
<24-7,BECKETT>也许这间房不是苏菲的目标
<24-7,BECKETT>Maybe it wasn't this room she was trying to get in to.

533
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,790
<24-7,BECKETT>打开隔壁房门的唯一原因就是
<24-7,BECKETT>The only reason to unlock the door adjacent to yours is if...

534
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,190
<24-8,CASTLE>知道你的芳邻是谁
<24-8,CASTLE>You knew who your neighbor was.

535
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,460
<24-9,BECKETT>苏菲进迈克房间的原因可能是
<24-9,BECKETT>Maybe Sophie only wanted to get in to Mike's room

536
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,200
<24-9,BECKETT>为了来这个房间
<24-9,BECKETT>so she could get in to this one.

537
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,530
<24-10,CASTLE>这是谁的房间
<24-10,CASTLE>So whose room is this?

538
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,040
<24-10,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<24-10,CASTLE>Castle.

539
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,560
<24-11,BECKETT>苏菲那只失了踪的耳环
<24-11,BECKETT>Sophie's missing earring.

540
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,330
<24-11,BECKETT>她可能是在此遇害的
<24-11,BECKETT>This could be where she was killed.

541
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,130
<24-12,GREG>你们在我房间做什么
<24-12,GREG>Hey, what are you doing in my room?

542
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,900
<25-1,GREG>这太离谱了  我没有杀苏菲·朗森
<25-1,GREG>This is crazy. I did not kill Sophie Ronson.

543
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,030
<25-2,CASTLE>那怎么在你的房间找到了她的耳环
<25-2,CASTLE>Then how did her earring end up in your room?

544
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,000
<25-3,BECKETT>你现在有机会澄清这一切  格雷格
<25-3,BECKETT>You have a chance to come clean here, Greg.

545
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,500
<25-3,BECKETT>如果我是你  我会讲实话
<25-3,BECKETT>If I were you, I would take it.

546
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,570
<25-4,GREG>我大概凌晨一点回到房间
<25-4,GREG>I got back to the room around 1:00.

547
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,940
<25-4,GREG>当时烂醉如泥
<25-4,GREG>I was pretty drunk.

548
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,480
<25-4,GREG>稍有意识已是凌晨两点
<25-4,GREG>Next thing I know it was 2:00 in the morning,

549
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,510
<25-4,GREG>有人在我的床上
<25-4,GREG>and somebody was in bed with me,

550
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,080
<25-4,GREG>对我上下其手
<25-4,GREG>and they had their hands down my pants.

551
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,680
<25-4,GREG>我以为是凯拉  以为她改变主意了
<25-4,GREG>I thought it was Kyra. I-I-I figured she changed her mind

552
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,750
<25-4,GREG>关于婚礼前分房睡...
<25-4,GREG>about spending the night apart.

553
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,250
<25-5,BECKETT>但居然是苏菲
<25-5,BECKETT>But it wasn't. It was Sophie.

554
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,750
<25-6,CASTLE>于是你想  管他的  见谁上谁
<25-6,CASTLE>And you figured, what the hell? Love the one you're with.

555
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,590
<25-7,GREG>不
<25-7,GREG>No.

556
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,590
<25-8,CASTLE>少装了  格雷格  苏菲很漂亮
<25-8,CASTLE>Oh, come on, Greg. Sophie's a beautiful girl,

557
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,900
<25-8,CASTLE>而且你只有数小时的自由了
<25-8,CASTLE>and you were hours away from

558
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,600
<25-8,CASTLE>马上就要戴上婚姻的枷锁
<25-8,CASTLE>strapping on the ball and chain for life.

559
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,970
<25-9,GREG>我爱凯拉  我永远不会背叛她
<25-9,GREG>No. I love Kyra. I would never cheat on her,

560
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,500
<25-10,BECKETT>尤其不会因为苏菲而背叛她
<25-10,BECKETT>especially with Sophie.

561
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,270
<25-10,BECKETT>为什么尤其不会因为苏菲
<25-10,BECKETT>Why especially with Sophie?

562
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,510
<25-11,CASTLE>你以前和苏菲上过床吗
<25-11,CASTLE>Had you slept with her before?

563
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,760
<25-12,GREG>为什么这个家伙在这儿
<25-12,GREG>Why is he here?

564
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,150
<25-12,GREG>他只是作家  不是警察
<25-12,GREG>He's a writer, not a cop.

565
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,590
<25-13,BECKETT>回答问题  格雷格  你是否和苏菲上过床
<25-13,BECKETT>Answer the question, Greg. Did you ever sleep with Sophie?

566
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,990
<25-14,GREG>一两次而已
<25-14,GREG>Once or twice.

567
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,130
<25-14,GREG>但那是在凯拉和我相识之前
<25-14,GREG>But it was before Kyra and I even met,

568
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,600
<25-14,GREG>而且我和苏菲都知道彼此不适合
<25-14,GREG>and we both knew that it was a mistake.

569
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,340
<25-15,CASTLE>不适合苏菲还要再找你
<25-15,CASTLE>A mistake that Sophie tried to repeat.

570
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,010
<25-15,CASTLE>可能她得手了
<25-15,CASTLE>Or maybe she succeeded.

571
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,440
<25-16,GREG>没有  当我看到她  我吓坏了
<25-16,GREG>No. When I saw her, I freaked.

572
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,410
<25-16,GREG>我用力推开她  她摔在了地板上
<25-16,GREG>I shoved her away. She fell on the floor.

573
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,980
<25-16,GREG>她的耳环肯定是因为那样才掉的
<25-16,GREG>That must have been when her earring came off.

574
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,690
<25-16,GREG>我还没反应过来  她就出去了
<25-16,GREG>Before I could do anything else, she ran out the door.

575
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,250
<25-16,GREG>这一切发生得太快
<25-16,GREG>I mean it all happened so fast, it didn't...

576
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,290
<25-16,GREG>感觉像是做梦似的
<25-16,GREG>it didn't even seem like it was real.

577
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,690
<25-17,BECKETT>在你知道苏菲被杀的时候
<25-17,BECKETT>Why didn't you say anything

578
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,390
<25-17,BECKETT>为什么要知情不报
<25-17,BECKETT>when you found out that Sophie was murdered?

579
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,300
<25-18,GREG>我就是怕引起误会
<25-18,GREG>Because I knew how it would sound.

580
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,730
<25-19,CASTLE>像现在这样的误会吗  真是谎话连篇
<25-19,CASTLE>Pretty much like it sounds right now, like a lie.

581
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,340
<25-20,GREG>我受够了  我要他离开
<25-20,GREG>Okay, that's it. I want him gone.

582
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,170
<25-20,GREG>很明显他是冲着我来的
<25-20,GREG>He's clearly got it out for me

583
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,240
<25-20,GREG>因为他想和我未婚妻重修旧好
<25-20,GREG>cause he wants to get back in my fiance's pants.

584
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,080
<25-21,CASTLE>我可不是杀人案的嫌疑犯
<25-21,CASTLE>I'm not the murder suspect here.

585
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,180
<25-22,GREG>他离开前我不会开口了
<25-22,GREG>I am done answering questions until he is gone.

586
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,710
<25-23,CASTLE>这儿轮不到你下命令  格雷格
<25-23,CASTLE>You don't make demands here, Greg.

587
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,450
<25-23,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<25-23,CASTLE>Castle.

588
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,620
<25-24,BECKETT>去看看莱恩和埃斯波西托回来了没
<25-24,BECKETT>Go and see if Ryan and Esposito have come back

589
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,820
<25-24,BECKETT>看看法证在格雷格的房间有没有发现
<25-24,BECKETT>with the forensics from Greg's hotel room.

590
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,570
<25-25,BECKETT>我们再来整理一下整个过程
<25-25,BECKETT>Now walk me through what happened again.

591
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,010
<26-1,TED MURPHY>别担心  格雷格
<26-1,TED MURPHY>Hey, don't you worry about this, Greg.

592
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,110
<26-1,TED MURPHY>我会善后的
<26-1,TED MURPHY>I got your back covered.

593
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,740
<26-2,GREG>谢谢  泰迪叔叔
<26-2,GREG>Thanks, Uncle Teddy.

594
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,820
<26-3,CASTLE>真不敢相信你就这么放他走了
<26-3,CASTLE>Can't believe you're letting him just walk out of here.

595
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,950
<26-4,BECKETT>我没有足够证据起诉他
<26-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I don't have enough evidence to convict him.

596
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,490
<26-5,CASTLE>别告诉我你相信他说的
<26-5,CASTLE>Oh, don't tell me you believe that story.

597
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,360
<26-5,CASTLE>那简单就是一部糟透了的成人电影
<26-5,CASTLE>It's like a porn movie gone wrong.

598
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
<26-6,BECKETT>的确  但如果是你要编故事骗人
<26-6,BECKETT>Exactly, and if you were gonna make up a story,

599
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,630
<26-6,BECKETT>你会编个这么糟的吗
<26-6,BECKETT>would you make up something like that?

600
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,060
<26-7,CASTLE>那又怎样  只能证明他不会编
<26-7,CASTLE>So? The guy is a suit, not a storyteller.

601
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,260
<26-7,CASTLE>并不代表他没做
<26-7,CASTLE>It doesn't make him any less guilty.

602
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,800
<26-8,BECKETT>别误会  他的嫌疑依然最重
<26-8,BECKETT>Look, don't get me wrong. He's still our best suspect.

603
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
<26-8,BECKETT>不像你  我只是还没准备好起诉他谋杀
<26-8,BECKETT>I'm just not as ready to convict him of murder as you seem to be.

604
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,130
<26-9,CASTLE>所以你就把我踢出了审讯室
<26-9,CASTLE>Is that why you kicked me out of the interrogation?

605
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,100
<26-10,BECKETT>很明显我单独审问效果更好
<26-10,BECKETT>It was clear that I was gonna get more out of Greg alone.

606
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,500
<26-10,BECKETT>你已经让感情蒙蔽了眼睛
<26-10,BECKETT>You're just too close to this case to see that.

607
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,670
<26-11,CASTLE>你是指我和凯拉太亲近
<26-11,CASTLE>You mean I'm too close to her.

608
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,280
<26-12,BECKETT>不错  知道我为什么这么觉得吗
<26-12,BECKETT>Yes, and do you know how I know that?

609
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,680
<26-12,BECKETT>往常的你这时候早已遍寻各种可能性
<26-12,BECKETT>If you weren't, you'd be all over the possibility

610
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,050
<26-12,BECKETT>去证明凯拉谋杀了苏菲
<26-12,BECKETT>that Kyra could've killed Sophie.

611
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,180
<26-13,CASTLE>完全没可能
<26-13,CASTLE>That's impossible.

612
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,580
<26-14,BECKETT>理查德·卡塞尔是不会说这句话的
<26-14,BECKETT>See, that's not what Richard Castle would say.

613
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,250
<26-14,BECKETT>他会想像婚礼的前一晚
<26-14,BECKETT>He would paint a picture about the night before the wedding,

614
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,460
<26-14,BECKETT>凯拉有可能睡不着
<26-14,BECKETT>about how Kyra couldn't fall asleep,

615
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,920
<26-14,BECKETT>于是她下楼去找格雷格
<26-14,BECKETT>and so she went down to see Greg.

616
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,830
<26-14,BECKETT>没想到苏菲从房间走出来
<26-14,BECKETT>Only to find Sophie emerging from his room,

617
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,600
<26-14,BECKETT>凯拉觉得未婚夫背叛了她
<26-14,BECKETT>and the thought that her fiance could cheat on her

618
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,170
<26-14,BECKETT>而且是在婚礼前夜  这太过份了
<26-14,BECKETT>the night before their wedding was too much.

619
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,370
<26-14,BECKETT>于是她尾随苏菲回房并与其对质
<26-14,BECKETT>And so she follows Sophie to her room and confronts her.

620
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,000
<26-14,BECKETT>暴力发生  苏菲陨命
<26-14,BECKETT>And when things get violent, Sophie ends up dead.

621
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,040
<26-14,BECKETT>你必须离凯拉远远的  卡塞尔
<26-14,BECKETT>You have to stay away from her, Castle.

622
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,840
<26-14,BECKETT>直到结案为止
<26-14,BECKETT>Until this case is closed.

623
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,170
<27-1,MARTHA>理查德·卡塞尔  你知不知道自己在做什么
<27-1,MARTHA>Richard Castle, what the hell are you doing?

624
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,410
<27-2,CASTLE>没什么
<27-2,CASTLE>Nothing.

625
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,680
<27-3,MARTHA>她是别人的新娘
<27-3,MARTHA>She's getting married to another man.

626
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,510
<27-4,CASTLE>只是张照片而已
<27-4,CASTLE>It's just a picture.

627
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,140
<27-5,MARTHA>无异于玩火自焚
<27-5,MARTHA>No, it's a loaded gun.

628
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,910
<27-6,CASTLE>我是卡塞尔
<27-6,CASTLE>Castle.

629
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,850
<27-7,KYRA>所有人的婚礼都是这个样子吗
<27-7,KYRA>Is everybody's wedding like this?

630
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,220
<27-8,CASTLE>凯拉
<27-8,CASTLE>Kyra.

631
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,350
<27-9,KYRA>我的伴娘被人杀了
<27-9,KYRA>So my bridesmaid's dead.

632
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,590
<27-9,KYRA>未婚夫可能是凶手
<27-9,KYRA>Uh, my fiance might be a murderer,

633
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,690
<27-9,KYRA>然后你又出现在我面前
<27-9,KYRA>and then there's you.

634
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,130
<27-10,CASTLE>你只是受的打击太大了
<27-10,CASTLE>You've just been through a bad shock. That's all.

635
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,830
<27-11,KYRA>你能和我见个面吗
<27-11,KYRA>Will you come meet me somewhere?

636
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,000
<27-12,CASTLE>我觉得这不是个好主意
<27-12,CASTLE>I don't think that'd be a good idea.

637
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,230
<27-12,CASTLE>求你了
<27-12,CASTLE>Please.

638
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,170
<27-13,KYRA>我只是想离开酒店一会儿
<27-13,KYRA>I just need to get out of the hotel for a little while.

639
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,800
<27-13,KYRA>如果继续听我妈在这里絮叨
<27-13,KYRA>I-if I have to listen to my mother judge me anymore,

640
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,770
<27-13,KYRA>恐怕我要抓几个人质了
<27-13,KYRA>I might start taking hostages.

641
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,440
<27-14,CASTLE>感同身受
<27-14,CASTLE>I understand completely.

642
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,810
<27-14,CASTLE>屋顶见面怎样
<27-14,CASTLE>How about the roof?

643
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,280
<27-15,KYRA>我们的秘密屋顶
<27-15,KYRA>Our secret roof.

644
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,050
<27-15,KYRA>太好了
<27-15,KYRA>That's perfect.

645
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,450
<27-15,KYRA>谢谢
<27-15,KYRA>Thank you.

646
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,090
<27-16,MARTHA>我的天
<27-16,MARTHA>Oh, brother.

647
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,450
<27-16,MARTHA>我希望你明白自己在做什么
<27-16,MARTHA>I hope you know what you're doing, kiddo.

648
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,330
<27-16,MARTHA>是的
<27-16,MARTHA>Yeah...

649
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:54,330
<27-17,CASTLE>我也想明白
<27-17,CASTLE>Me, too.

650
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,440
<28-1,KYRA>你怎么会知道门没锁
<28-1,KYRA>How did you know the door would still be unlocked

651
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,410
<28-1,KYRA>毕竟这么多年了
<28-1,KYRA>after all these years?

652
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,880
<28-2,CASTLE>有些事是不会变的
<28-2,CASTLE>Some things never change.

653
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,840
<28-3,KYRA>那年夏天我们总是待在这儿
<28-3,KYRA>We spent so much time up here that summer.

654
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,090
<28-3,KYRA>我下课后你就会来
<28-3,KYRA>You would come over after I got out of class.

655
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,820
<28-3,KYRA>一手拎着吃的  一手拿着笔记本
<28-3,KYRA>Bag of food in one hand, and that notebook in the other.

656
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,590
<28-4,CASTLE>接着我开始写作  你假装学习
<28-4,CASTLE>And then I would write, and you would pretend to study.

657
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,600
<28-5,KYRA>-我才没假装呢  -是吗
<28-5,KYRA>- I wasn't pretending. - Oh?

658
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,820
<28-7,KYRA>好吧  你太有魅力了让我无法抗拒
<28-7,KYRA>Okay, well, I just had a hard time keeping my hands off of you.

659
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,940
<28-8,CASTLE>格雷格知道你在这儿吗
<28-8,CASTLE>Does Greg know you're here?

660
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,810
<28-9,KYRA>他跟我讲了苏菲去过他房间
<28-9,KYRA>He told me about Sophie in his room

661
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,540
<28-9,KYRA>还有他和苏菲以前的关系
<28-9,KYRA>and about, uh, him and Sophie... before.

662
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,550
<28-9,KYRA>他说很抱歉之前没有告诉我
<28-9,KYRA>He said he was sorry he didn't tell me.

663
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,170
<28-10,CASTLE>那你信任他吗
<28-10,CASTLE>Do you believe him?

664
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:03,260
<28-10,CASTLE>我只是不想看到你受伤害
<28-10,CASTLE>I just don't want to see you get hurt.

665
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,030
<28-11,KYRA>太迟了
<28-11,KYRA>Hmm. Too late.

666
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,610
<28-12,KYRA>我想你  里克
<28-12,KYRA>I missed you, Rick.

667
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,310
<28-12,KYRA>重逢前我可不知道有这么想你
<28-12,KYRA>And I didn't realize how much until I saw you yesterday.

668
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,380
<28-13,CASTLE>我也想你
<28-13,CASTLE>I missed you, too.

669
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,770
<29-1,BECKETT>我跟你说过什么
<29-1,BECKETT>What did I tell you?

670
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,130
<29-2,CASTLE>什么
<29-2,CASTLE>What?

671
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,050
<29-3,BECKETT>我到底是说清楚了还是没有
<29-3,BECKETT>Did I or did I not make myself clear?

672
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,990
<29-4,CASTLE>说清楚了
<29-4,CASTLE>Yes.

673
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,460
<29-5,BECKETT>那你知不知道  知晓你的作为我有多烦
<29-5,BECKETT>Do you know how much it annoys me, knowing what you doing.

674
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,000
<29-5,BECKETT>碰你不该碰的
<29-5,BECKETT>Touching things that should be touched,

675
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,010
<29-5,BECKETT>动你不该动的
<29-5,BECKETT>yanking on things that shouldn't be yanked?

676
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,200
<29-6,CASTLE>没有人动任何的东西
<29-6,CASTLE>No one--no, no, body yanked on anything.

677
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
<29-7,BECKETT>真得吗  那这个你如何解释
<29-7,BECKETT>Really? Then how do you explain this?

678
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,100
<29-8,CASTLE>什么
<29-8,CASTLE>Huh?

679
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
<29-9,BECKETT>别这样看着我
<29-9,BECKETT>Oh, don't give me that look.

680
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,850
<29-9,BECKETT>我告诫过你无数次了  别动我的椅子
<29-9,BECKETT>I've told you a million times not to mess with my chair.

681
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,850
<29-10,CASTLE>没错  不碰
<29-10,CASTLE>Right. No.

682
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,010
<29-10,CASTLE>对不起
<29-10,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

683
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,580
<29-10,CASTLE>再也不会发生这种事了
<29-10,CASTLE>And it-- it won't happen again.

684
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,630
<29-11,CASTLE>昨晚我和她见面了
<29-11,CASTLE>I saw her last night.

685
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,840
<29-12,BECKETT>我知道
<29-12,BECKETT>I know.

686
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,300
<29-13,CASTLE>什么
<29-13,CASTLE>What?

687
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,420
<29-14,CASTLE>你监视我吗
<29-14,CASTLE>You had me under surveillance?

688
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,220
<29-15,BECKETT>不是你  而是凯拉
<29-15,BECKETT>Not you. Kyra.

689
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,760
<29-16,CASTLE>为什么要监视凯拉
<29-16,CASTLE>Why would you have Kyra under surveillance?

690
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,660
<29-17,BECKETT>因为她是谋杀案的嫌犯
<29-17,BECKETT>She's a murder suspect.

691
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,030
<29-18,CASTLE>不  苏菲遇害
<29-18,CASTLE>Oh, no, no, see, Sophie's murder

692
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,200
<29-18,CASTLE>是一个完全独立的  非预谋性案件
<29-18,CASTLE>was an isolated crime of passion.

693
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,930
<29-18,CASTLE>监视凯拉
<29-18,CASTLE>Watching Kyra after the fact

694
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,870
<29-18,CASTLE>是浪费警力
<29-18,CASTLE>would be a waste of police resources,

695
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,200
<29-18,CASTLE>而你不该这么做
<29-18,CASTLE>which we both know you would not do.

696
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,010
<29-19,BECKETT>我没法保证你不做傻事
<29-19,BECKETT>I had to make sure that you didn'to anything stupid,

697
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,110
<29-19,BECKETT>而你竟然真那么做了
<29-19,BECKETT>which you did.

698
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,840
<29-20,CASTLE>我们只是接了个吻  仅此而已
<29-20,CASTLE>We just kissed. That's all that happened.

699
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,780
<29-21,BECKETT>现在仅此而已
<29-21,BECKETT>That's all that happened for now.

700
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,350
<29-22,ESPOSITO>财务...
<29-22,ESPOSITO>Hey, the financial...

701
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,650
<29-23,ESPOSITO>你们还好吧
<29-23,ESPOSITO>Everything okay?

702
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,090
<29-24,BECKETT>-没事  -不好
<29-24,BECKETT>- Yeah. - No.

703
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,790
<29-25,CASTLE>好
<29-25,CASTLE>Okay.

704
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,060
<29-26,ESPOSITO>新郎的财务状况  没有可疑
<29-26,ESPOSITO>Financials came in on our groom. No red flags.

705
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,610
<29-26,ESPOSITO>不过对于有信托基金的人来说
<29-26,ESPOSITO>He actually lives pretty modest

706
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,160
<29-26,ESPOSITO>他倒是过的很节俭
<29-26,ESPOSITO>for someone with a trust fund.

707
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
<29-27,BECKETT>实验室有消息吗
<29-27,BECKETT>Anything back from the lab?

708
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600
<29-28,ESPOSITO>没有有用的结果
<29-28,ESPOSITO>Nothing useful.

709
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,930
<29-28,ESPOSITO>格雷格的头发和纤维样本并不吻合
<29-28,ESPOSITO>Greg's hair and fiber samples came back negative.

710
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,800
<29-28,ESPOSITO>除了耳环  没有其他物证
<29-28,ESPOSITO>Other than the earring, there's no physical evidence

711
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,910
<29-28,ESPOSITO>证明他是凶手
<29-28,ESPOSITO>tying him to the murder.

712
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,140
<29-29,RYAN>所以我重新检查了苏菲参加婚礼的行程
<29-29,RYAN>So I retraced Sophie's steps leading up to the wedding.

713
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,210
<29-29,RYAN>她周五入住博蒙特酒店
<29-29,RYAN>She checked into the Beaumont on Friday,

714
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,250
<29-29,RYAN>但周四上午已抵达纽约
<29-29,RYAN>but she flew in to the city on Thursday morning.

715
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,680
<29-30,BECKETT>周四一整天她在做什么呢
<29-30,BECKETT>What was she doing all day Thursday?

716
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,180
<30-1,KEITH MURPHY>不知道  我也是预演晚宴才见到她
<30-1,KEITH MURPHY>I don't know. I didn't even see her until the rehearsal dinner,

717
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,550
<30-1,KEITH MURPHY>我们一句话也没说
<30-1,KEITH MURPHY>and we didn't even talk.

718
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,550
<30-2,TED MURPHY>恐怕我帮不上忙  我跟她不熟
<30-2,TED MURPHY>I'm afraid I can't help you. I, uh, I barely knew the girl.

719
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,720
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>不  我第一次见到苏菲
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>No, the first time I saw Sophie

720
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,150
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>是在周五早上的婚礼早餐
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>was at the wedding breakfast on Friday morning.

721
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,420
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>我不知道苏菲在做什么
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>I have no idea what Sophie was doing,

722
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,880
<30-4,SHEILA BLAINE>但肯定没好事
<30-4,SHEILA BLAINE>but I'm sure it was nothing good.

723
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,990
<28-1,KYRA>你们知道吗
<28-1,KYRA>Did you know

724
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,890
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>她在订婚派对后给我打电话
<30-3,LAURIE HILL>that she called me after the engagement party

725
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,090
<30-4,SHEILA BLAINE>叫我给她付机票钱
<30-4,SHEILA BLAINE>to ask me to pay for her flight?

726
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,990
<30-5,RYAN>-你付钱了吗  -当然没有
<30-5,RYAN>- And did you? - Of course not.

727
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,890
<30-6,SHEILA BLAINE>我告诉她  自己的事自己做
<30-6,SHEILA BLAINE>I told her, people have to make their own way.

728
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,960
<30-7,ESPOSITO>所以你不知道苏菲周四在做什么吗
<30-7,ESPOSITO>So you have no idea what Sophie did on Thursday?

729
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,600
<30-8,SHEILA BLAINE>不知道  但猜猜我周五刚见到她时
<30-8,SHEILA BLAINE>No. But guess what she was doing on Friday

730
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,170
<30-8,SHEILA BLAINE>她在做什么
<30-8,SHEILA BLAINE>when I first saw her.

731
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:35,970
<30-9,ESPOSITO>她在做什么
<30-9,ESPOSITO>What's that?

732
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,000
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>在酒店的商场购物
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>Shopping at the hotel store.

733
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,340
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>她跟所有人说她一贫如洗
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>Here she is telling everybody how broke she is,

734
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,040
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>然后摇身一变  挥金如土
<30-10,SHEILA BLAINE>And somehow... oh, suddenly, she has money to burn.

735
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,180
<31-1,BECKETT>买鞋  买礼服  住宿费和机票
<31-1,BECKETT>Between the shoes, the dress, the hotel and the flight,

736
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,050
<31-1,BECKETT>这周末苏菲轻轻松松花掉了三千美元
<31-1,BECKETT>Sophie must have dropped 3 grand on this weekend, easy.

737
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,650
<31-2,ESPOSITO>让人费解  她在银行的余额只有18美元
<31-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know how. Her bank balance is $18

738
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,400
<31-2,ESPOSITO>信用卡也已刷爆
<31-2,ESPOSITO>And her credit cards are maxed out.

739
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,650
<31-3,CASTLE>毒贩说她买迷药花了多少钱
<31-3,CASTLE>How much did the drug dealer say she paid for the roofies?

740
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,220
<31-4,RYAN>两百现金
<31-4,RYAN>200 bucks cash.

741
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,250
<31-5,ESPOSITO>问题是
<31-5,ESPOSITO>The problem is,

742
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,920
<31-5,ESPOSITO>为买飞纽约的机票  她取出最后一百块
<31-5,ESPOSITO>Sophie withdrew her last $100 to fly to New York.

743
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,190
<31-5,ESPOSITO>我认为  她应该拿不出两百块
<31-5,ESPOSITO>As far as I can tell, she didn't have the 200 bucks to give.

744
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,930
<31-6,CASTLE>那么是谁为迷药买了单
<31-6,CASTLE>So who paid for the drugs?

745
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,090
<31-7,BECKETT>别提迷药了  我当过六次伴娘了
<31-7,BECKETT>Forget the drugs. I've been a bridesmaid six times.

746
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,160
<31-7,BECKETT>她怎么买得起礼服
<31-7,BECKETT>How did she pay for the dress?

747
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
<31-7,BECKETT>好  谢谢
<31-7,BECKETT>Okay, thank you.

748
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,300
<32-1,BECKETT>苏菲不仅用现金付了机票
<32-1,BECKETT>So not only did Sophie pay for her flight in cash,

749
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,810
<32-1,BECKETT>还用现金缴了之前三个月的房租
<32-1,BECKETT>but she also made her last three rent payments in cash as well.

750
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,870
<32-2,CASTLE>知不知道这些钱从哪里来的
<32-2,CASTLE>Any idea where it all came from?

751
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,370
<32-3,BECKETT>还不知道
<32-3,BECKETT>Not yet.

752
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,940
<32-4,CASTLE>当了六次伴娘
<32-4,CASTLE>So... six times a bridesmaid, huh?

753
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,780
<32-4,CASTLE>你没有照片  对吗
<32-4,CASTLE>You wouldn't happen to have any pictures, would you?

754
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,350
<32-5,RYAN>谁想看新娘用品店的监控录像
<32-5,RYAN>Who feels like watching a little bridal shop surveillance video?

755
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,580
<32-6,CASTLE>好看吗  有什么劲爆内容吗
<32-6,CASTLE>Is it good? Will--will I be shocked?

756
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,990
<32-7,ESPOSITO>你绝对想不到的
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, you definitely did not see this one coming.

757
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,890
<32-8,BECKETT>这是苏菲
<32-8,BECKETT>Okay, there's Sophie.

758
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,100
<32-8,BECKETT>格雷格的叔叔泰迪
<32-8,BECKETT>Greg's uncle Teddy.

759
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,630
<32-9,CASTLE>他说自己和她不熟
<32-9,CASTLE>He said he barely knew her.

760
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,800
<32-10,RYAN>他绝对认识她
<32-10,RYAN>Oh, he definitely knew her.

761
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,130
<32-10,RYAN>根据新娘用品店老板的话
<32-10,RYAN>According to the bridal shop owner,

762
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,800
<32-10,RYAN>当泰迪为礼服买单时  苏菲说
<32-10,RYAN>when Teddy was paying for the dress, Sophie told him

763
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,070
<32-10,RYAN>不知道自己能不能做好
<32-10,RYAN>she wasn't sure if she could go through with it.

764
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,810
<32-11,ESPOSITO>但泰迪说  他已经为她做了那么多
<32-11,ESPOSITO>But Teddy said, after all he'd done for her,

765
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,310
<32-11,ESPOSITO>她不能再退缩了
<32-11,ESPOSITO>she couldn't back out now.

766
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,310
<32-12,CASTLE>听过新娘的婚前恐惧症  不想伴娘也有
<32-12,CASTLE>Now I've heard of brides getting cold feet. But bridesmaids?

767
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,080
<32-13,BECKETT>他是用现金买的礼服吗
<32-13,BECKETT>Did he pay for the dress in cash?

768
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,810
<32-14,RYAN>是  你怎么知道
<32-14,RYAN>Yep. How'd you know?

769
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,780
<32-15,BECKETT>好叔叔用现金付账
<32-15,BECKETT>All that cash means that uncle sugar daddy didn't want

770
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,190
<32-15,BECKETT>就掩盖了他和苏菲的关系
<32-15,BECKETT>a paper trail tying him to whatever Sophie was doing for him.

771
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,760
<32-16,CASTLE>他们之间会是什么关系呢
<32-16,CASTLE>Yeah, but what could it be?

772
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,790
<32-16,CASTLE>为什么苏菲一定要参加格雷格的婚礼呢
<32-16,CASTLE>And why was it so important for Sophie to go to Greg's wedding?

773
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,700
<33-1,GREG>这太荒谬了
<33-1,GREG>This is ridiculous.

774
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,900
<33-1,GREG>你们没有证据起诉我
<33-1,GREG>You don't have enough to build a case against me,

775
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,740
<33-1,GREG>就抓我的家人吗
<33-1,GREG>So you go after someone else in my family?

776
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,940
<33-2,BECKETT>我们只为找出真相
<33-2,BECKETT>We're trying to get to the truth.

777
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,370
<33-3,GREG>审我叔叔就行了吗
<33-3,GREG>By hauling in my uncle?

778
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,670
<33-3,GREG>天啊  他几乎不认识苏菲
<33-3,GREG>For god sakes, he barely knew Sophie.

779
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,500
<33-4,CASTLE>但他为她700美元的礼服买单
<33-4,CASTLE>And yet he paid for her $700 dress

780
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,110
<33-4,CASTLE>还有她来这里的飞机票
<33-4,CASTLE>and her plane ticket out here.

781
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,740
<33-5,GREG>他给她买礼服
<33-5,GREG>He bought her dress?

782
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,210
<33-6,BECKETT>如果跟她不熟  为什么这么做
<33-6,BECKETT>If he barely knew her, why would he do that?

783
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,640
<33-7,GREG>有传言说
<33-7,GREG>We heard through the grapevine

784
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,380
<33-7,GREG>苏菲可能没钱
<33-7,GREG>that Sophie might have some trouble making the money

785
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,910
<33-7,GREG>来参加婚礼
<33-7,GREG>to come out here to the wedding.

786
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,380
<33-7,GREG>泰迪可能是为了我们才帮她
<33-7,GREG>Maybe Teddy was trying to help her out for us.

787
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,320
<33-8,BECKETT>这并不能解释清楚
<33-8,BECKETT>That doesn't explain the $1,500

788
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,520
<33-8,BECKETT>为何三个月给了她1500美元
<33-8,BECKETT>that he paid her the last three month.

789
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,150
<33-9,GREG>他给她钱
<33-9,GREG>He was-- he was paying her?

790
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,890
<33-11,GREG>为什么
<33-11,GREG>For what?

791
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,290
<33-12,CASTLE>他们做了个交易
<33-12,CASTLE>Some kind of deal they got going on.

792
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,520
<33-12,CASTLE>我们认为这可能
<33-12,CASTLE>We think it could have something to do

793
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,390
<33-12,CASTLE>和她在你婚礼前夜的行为有关
<33-12,CASTLE>with the way she was behaving the night before your wedding.

794
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,420
<33-13,GREG>没错
<33-13,GREG>Yeah, sure.

795
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,730
<33-13,GREG>他花钱让苏菲迷倒一个伴郎
<33-13,GREG>Uh, he--he paid Sophie to roofie a groomsman

796
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,260
<33-13,GREG>然后爬到我的床上
<33-13,GREG>and then to climb into bed with me.

797
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,300
<33-14,BECKETT>我知道这听起来
<33-14,BECKETT>Look, we know how this sounds--

798
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,630
<33-15,GREG>听起来就像里克小册子里的情节
<33-15,GREG>It sounds like something out of one of Rick's little books.

799
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,560
<33-16,CASTLE>小册子
<33-16,CASTLE>Little books?

800
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,100
<33-17,GREG>除了搅乱婚礼
<33-17,GREG>What would even be the point of that

801
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,500
<33-17,GREG>还能有什么目的
<33-17,GREG>except to mess up the wedding?

802
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,670
<33-17,GREG>泰迪为什么要这么做
<33-17,GREG>Why the hell would Teddy want that?

803
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,200
<33-18,CASTLE>我们也想知道
<33-18,CASTLE>That's what we're trying to find out.

804
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,970
<33-19,GREG>天啊  接下来你就会告诉我
<33-19,GREG>Oh, my god. For god sakes. Next you're gonna tell me

805
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,580
<33-19,GREG>他也爱上凯拉了
<33-19,GREG>that he's in love with Kyra, too.

806
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,110
<33-20,CASTLE>什么意思
<33-20,CASTLE>What is that supposed to mean?

807
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,880
<33-21,BECKETT>你们俩
<33-21,BECKETT>You guys--

808
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
<33-22,GREG>你知道我是什么意思
<33-22,GREG>You know damn well what it's supposed to mean.

809
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,510
<33-23,CASTLE>不  格雷格  我不知道
<33-23,CASTLE>No Greg, I don't.

810
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,710
<33-24,BECKETT>如果你有话想说
<33-24,BECKETT>If you've got something to say to me,

811
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,850
<33-25,CASTLE>直说好了
<33-25,CASTLE>why don't you just say it?

812
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,580
<33-26,GREG>我爱凯拉  里克  她是我的一切
<33-26,GREG>I love Kyra, Rick. She means the world to me.

813
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,290
<33-26,GREG>也许你不懂  也许你无所谓
<33-26,GREG>Maybe you can't see it. Maybe you don't care.

814
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,960
<33-26,GREG>但泰迪只会支持我们
<33-26,GREG>But Teddy has been nothing but supportive of us

815
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,920
<33-26,GREG>全心全意
<33-26,GREG>the whole way.

816
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,390
<33-26,GREG>他提交我们的婚礼申请
<33-26,GREG>He filed our wedding license.

817
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,160
<33-26,GREG>他帮我们起草婚前协议
<33-26,GREG>He helped us write our prenup.

818
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,390
<33-26,GREG>他一直照看
<33-26,GREG>He always looks after...

819
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,770
<33-27,BECKETT>什么
<33-27,BECKETT>What?

820
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,470
<33-28,GREG>我打个电话
<33-28,GREG>I gotta make a call.

821
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,780
<34-1,TED MURPHY>你们知道我坐这多久了吗
<34-1,TED MURPHY>Do you know how long I've been sitting in here?

822
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,850
<34-2,CASTLE>不好意思让你等  我还没吃饭
<34-2,CASTLE>I'm sorry for the wait. I hadn't had anything to eat.

823
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,680
<34-2,CASTLE>我们没讨论好去哪个餐馆
<34-2,CASTLE>We couldn't decide on a restaurant.

824
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,290
<34-3,TED MURPHY>很好笑吗
<34-3,TED MURPHY>What do you think this is, funny?

825
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,590
<34-4,BECKETT>这些文件眼熟吗  墨菲先生
<34-4,BECKETT>Do you recognize these files, Mr. Murphy?

826
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,020
<34-5,TED MURPHY>你们去了我的办公室
<34-5,TED MURPHY>You went to my office?

827
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,530
<34-6,BECKETT>有搜查令的  不用担心
<34-6,BECKETT>We got a warrant first. Don't worry.

828
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,990
<34-7,TED MURPHY>你这种外行根本理解不了
<34-7,TED MURPHY>Look, a layman like you couldn't possibly understand

829
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:10,390
<34-7,TED MURPHY>格雷格家产业在经济和法律上的
<34-7,TED MURPHY>the financial and the legal complications

830
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,890
<34-7,TED MURPHY>复杂性
<34-7,TED MURPHY>of an estate like Greg's.

831
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,560
<34-8,CASTLE>我想他只是骂你蠢
<34-8,CASTLE>I think he just called you stupid.

832
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,670
<34-9,BECKETT>格雷格的祖父母建立了一份信托基金
<34-9,BECKETT>Greg's grandparents established a trust fund

833
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:20,070
<34-9,BECKETT>他本将在婚礼当天得到
<34-9,BECKETT>that he was going to receive on his wedding day,

834
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,910
<34-9,BECKETT>而你是遗嘱执行人  我怎么知道的
<34-9,BECKETT>and named you executor. How am I doing so far?

835
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,510
<34-9,BECKETT>过去的五年间
<34-9,BECKETT>And for the past five years,

836
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,010
<34-9,BECKETT>你一直从那笔基金中窃取款项
<34-9,BECKETT>you have been stealing from that fund

837
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,780
<34-9,BECKETT>以满足你奢侈的生活
<34-9,BECKETT>to fuel your expensive lifestyle--

838
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,280
<34-9,BECKETT>在汉普顿买了间房  还买了一辆法拉利
<34-9,BECKETT>a house in the hamptons, a Ferrari.

839
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,550
<34-9,BECKETT>最昂贵的隆胸手术
<34-9,BECKETT>A pair of top-of-the-line breast implants.

840
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,990
<34-9,BECKETT>我想你应该不是自用
<34-9,BECKETT>I'm assuming those aren't for you, though.

841
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,720
<34-10,TED MURPHY>我的私生活与你们无关
<34-10,TED MURPHY>My personal life is none of your business.

842
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,320
<34-11,BECKETT>除非这跟杀人案有关
<34-11,BECKETT>It is when it leads to a murder.

843
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,460
<34-11,BECKETT>你在股市赔了一大笔钱
<34-11,BECKETT>You lost a ton of money in the market.

844
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,960
<34-12,TED MURPHY>大家都赔了
<34-12,TED MURPHY>Everybody did.

845
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,660
<34-13,BECKETT>但只有你能接触格雷格的信托基金
<34-13,BECKETT>But not everybody had access to Greg's trust fund.

846
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,170
<34-13,BECKETT>你花光了自己的钱  就开始用他的
<34-13,BECKETT>When you ran out of your own money, you started using his.

847
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,170
<34-13,BECKETT>两百万美金几乎挥霍一空
<34-13,BECKETT>Burned through almost the entire $2 million,

848
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,180
<34-13,BECKETT>然后他告诉你
<34-13,BECKETT>and then when he called you

849
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,970
<34-13,BECKETT>他要订婚了  你慌了
<34-13,BECKETT>to tell you he was getting engaged, you panicked

850
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,910
<34-13,BECKETT>因为你补不上这个大洞了
<34-13,BECKETT>because you didn't have enough equity to put it back.

851
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,970
<34-14,CASTLE>你想到阻止事情败露的唯一方法
<34-14,CASTLE>You realized the only way to avoid detection

852
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:58,040
<34-14,CASTLE>就是阻止婚礼  但是怎么做呢
<34-14,CASTLE>was to put a stop to the wedding, but how?

853
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,910
<34-14,CASTLE>格雷格很明显爱着凯拉
<34-14,CASTLE>Greg was clearly in love with Kyra.

854
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,210
<34-14,CASTLE>凯拉也爱他
<34-14,CASTLE>Kyra was in love with him.

855
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,950
<34-15,BECKETT>然后你在订婚派对见到苏菲
<34-15,BECKETT>And then you met Sophie at the engagement party,

856
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,220
<34-15,BECKETT>想到拿她做破坏格雷格婚礼的
<34-15,BECKETT>and you realized that she was the perfect instrument

857
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,580
<34-15,BECKETT>完美棋子
<34-15,BECKETT>to sabotage Greg's wedding

858
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,190
<34-15,BECKETT>因为她非常需要钱
<34-15,BECKETT>because she was so desperate for money.

859
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,320
<34-16,TED MURPHY>太荒谬了
<34-16,TED MURPHY>That's ridiculous.

860
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,990
<34-17,CASTLE>尤其因为她还单恋着格雷格
<34-17,CASTLE>The fact that she still carried a torch for Greg

861
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,860
<34-17,CASTLE>说服她午夜无人时
<34-17,CASTLE>made it that much easier to convince her

862
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,600
<34-17,CASTLE>溜进格雷格的房间就更容易了
<34-17,CASTLE>to sneak into Greg's room in the middle of the night...

863
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,970
<34-18,BECKETT>这个  苏菲的相机
<34-18,BECKETT>With this- Sophie's video camera.

864
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,700
<34-18,BECKETT>你放在酒店的行李里的
<34-18,BECKETT>We found this in your luggage in the hotel.

865
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,110
<34-18,BECKETT>上面还有苏菲的指纹
<34-18,BECKETT>It still has Sophie's fingerprints all over it.

866
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,310
<34-19,CASTLE>她没有完成你的要求  对不对
<34-19,CASTLE>Only she didn't quite get the footage you were hoping for, did she?

867
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,980
<34-19,CASTLE>格雷格拒绝苏菲后
<34-19,CASTLE>When Greg refused Sophie's advances,

868
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,220
<34-19,CASTLE>她就改变主意了
<34-19,CASTLE>she had a change of heart.

869
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,990
<34-19,CASTLE>她跑回房间  你正在那里等她
<34-19,CASTLE>She ran back to her room, where you were there, waiting for her.

870
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,120
<34-20,BECKETT>发生了什么  墨菲先生
<34-20,BECKETT>What happened, Mr. Murphy?

871
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,590
<34-20,BECKETT>她是否威胁说要把你供出来
<34-20,BECKETT>Did she threaten to expose you,

872
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,330
<34-20,BECKETT>告诉大家你指使她破坏婚礼
<34-20,BECKETT>tell everybody what you asked her to do?

873
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,830
<34-21,CASTLE>你可不能让事情这么发展下去
<34-21,CASTLE>You couldn't let that happen.

874
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,660
<34-21,CASTLE>然后你想到还有一种方法
<34-21,CASTLE>And then you realized there was another way

875
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,560
<34-21,CASTLE>能破坏格雷格的婚礼  杀死伴娘
<34-21,CASTLE>to sabotage Greg's wedding-- kill a bridesmaid.

876
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,360
<34-22,TED MURPHY>精彩绝伦的好故事
<34-22,TED MURPHY>Wow. What a story.

877
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,370
<34-22,TED MURPHY>而且讲得绘声绘色
<34-22,TED MURPHY>And very well told, I might add.

878
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,430
<34-22,TED MURPHY>但也不过是瞎掰
<34-22,TED MURPHY>Yeah, but that's all it is... a story.

879
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,770
<34-22,TED MURPHY>真的吗
<34-22,TED MURPHY>Really?

880
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,700
<34-23,BECKETT>你还记得我说过
<34-23,BECKETT>Do you remember how I told you

881
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,600
<34-23,BECKETT>我们搜查了你的行李吗
<34-23,BECKETT>that we went through your luggage?

882
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,770
<34-23,BECKETT>我们发现了这个领带夹
<34-23,BECKETT>We found this tie tack.

883
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,670
<34-23,BECKETT>白金的  对吗
<34-23,BECKETT>Platinum, right?

884
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,740
<34-23,BECKETT>我们在苏菲背部的伤口上
<34-23,BECKETT>Did you know that we found trace evidence of platinum

885
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,870
<34-23,BECKETT>发现了微量的白金
<34-23,BECKETT>in the wounds in Sophie's back?

886
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,080
<34-24,CASTLE>你大概是想不到的
<34-24,CASTLE>You probably didn't even realize you were making them

887
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,710
<34-24,CASTLE>你从背后勒死她的时候留下了痕迹
<34-24,CASTLE>when you were choking her from behind.

888
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,180
<34-25,BECKETT>所以你完全没想到
<34-25,BECKETT>Which is why it never occurred to you

889
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,410
<34-25,BECKETT>要丢掉这个能将你绳之于法的
<34-25,BECKETT>to get rid of the one piece of physical evidence

890
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,520
<34-25,BECKETT>物证
<34-25,BECKETT>that tied you to the crime.

891
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,520
<34-26,CASTLE>不好意思让你久等了
<34-26,CASTLE>We're sorry we kept you waiting.

892
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,090
<35-1,GREG>苏菲  你要做什么
<35-1,GREG>Sophie, what are you doing?

893
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,790
<35-2,SOPHIE>来啊  格雷格  你和我最后一次
<35-2,SOPHIE>Come on, Greg. You and me, one last time.

894
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,260
<35-2,SOPHIE>我们以前就很和谐
<35-2,SOPHIE>We were good together.

895
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,060
<35-4,SOPHIE>-不  住手  -来嘛  会很爽的
<35-4,SOPHIE>- No. Stop it. - Come on. It'll be fun.

896
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,490
<35-5,GREG>不  你怎么了
<35-5,GREG>No. What's the matter with you?

897
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,630
<35-7,GREG>-我只是想  -我明天要结婚了
<35-7,GREG>- I just thought-- - I'm getting married tomorrow, okay,

898
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,030
<35-7,GREG>和我爱的女人
<35-7,GREG>to the woman that I love.

899
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,930
<35-8,CASTLE>泰迪的计划本可能成功德
<35-8,CASTLE>Teddy's plan would've worked, too,

900
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,700
<35-8,CASTLE>只是他忽略了一个人
<35-8,CASTLE>If it weren't for the one thing he didn't count on.

901
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,340
<35-8,CASTLE>格雷格
<35-8,CASTLE>Greg.

902
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,080
<35-8,CASTLE>他是个好男人  凯拉
<35-8,CASTLE>He's a good man, Kyra.

903
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,580
<35-8,CASTLE>一个守信的男人
<35-8,CASTLE>He's an honorable man.

904
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,010
<35-8,CASTLE>深爱着你
<35-8,CASTLE>And he loves you.

905

<35-8,CASTLE>我知道
<35-8,CASTLE>I know.

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,220
<35-9,KYRA>我也爱他
<35-9,KYRA>And I love him, too.

907
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,930
<35-9,KYRA>可这并不表示
<35-9,KYRA>But that does not mean

908
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,500
<35-9,KYRA>我会时不时想念你
<35-9,KYRA>that I'm not gonna think about you from time to time.

909
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,100
<35-10,CASTLE>最好是
<35-10,CASTLE>Oh, you better.

910
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,370
<35-11,KYRA>纽约城那么多场婚礼
<35-11,KYRA>Of all the murders

911
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,340
<35-11,KYRA>那么多谋杀案
<35-11,KYRA>in all the cities at all the weddings...

912
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,870
<35-11,KYRA>你却来帮了我
<35-11,KYRA>and you walk into mine.

913
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,780
<35-12,CASTLE>很高兴我来了
<35-12,CASTLE>I'm glad I did.

<35-14,KYRA>把他完全交给你了
<35-14,KYRA>He's all yours.

916
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,760
<36-1,MINISTER>如果有谁要反对
<36-1,MINISTER>If any person can show just cause

917
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,990
<36-1,MINISTER>这两位新人的结合
<36-1,MINISTER>as to why these two may not be joined together,

918
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,090
<36-1,MINISTER>请示意  否则请永远祝福他们
<36-1,MINISTER>Let them speak now or forever hold their peace.

919
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,470
<36-1,MINISTER>以纽约州法律赋予的合法权利
<36-1,MINISTER>By the power vested in me by the state of New York
