00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:45,802
<2-14,CASTLE>无可奉告
<2-14,CASTLE>I really can't say.

00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,065
<2-17,CASTLE>这事儿不复杂
<2-17,CASTLE>It's not that complicated.

77
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:55,249
<2-18,ESPOSITO>有人用他的头来做挥棒练习
<2-18,ESPOSITO>Someone used his head for batting practice.

<2-19,CASTLE>36盎司的棒球直击后脑
<2-19,CASTLE>36-ounces to the back of the head.

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,358
<2-19,CASTLE>从血迹来看
<2-19,CASTLE>By the look of the spatter,

<2-20,BECKETT>-死者被多次击中  -死亡时间
<2-20,BECKETT>- he was hit multiple times. - Time of death?

81
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,905
<2-20,BECKETT>根据尸温  我认为他已死亡两个小时
<2-20,BECKETT>Uh, from his temperature, I'd say two,

82
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:04,333
<2-21,BECKETT>最多三个小时
<2-21,BECKETT>maybe three hour at the most.

83
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,921
<2-22,ESPOSITO>这些伤痕是怎么回事
<2-22,ESPOSITO>What's with all this bruising?

84
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,915
<2-22,ESPOSITO>死后由棒球击打造成的
<2-22,ESPOSITO>Postmortem, from the balls.

85
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:10,505
<2-22,ESPOSITO>发球器在他死亡后  还运转了一段时间
<2-22,ESPOSITO>Pitching arm--it ran for a while after he was dead.

86
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,638
<2-23,CASTLE>像卡尼奥·维加这样的选手
<2-23,CASTLE>So you'd think a guy like Cano Vega

87
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,758
<2-23,CASTLE>在自家地下室肯定有击球练习笼
<2-23,CASTLE>would have a batting cage in his basement.

88
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,785
<2-23,CASTLE>他这么晚到西班牙裔黑人区
<2-23,CASTLE>What would he be doing in a sketchy neighborhood

89
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,393
<2-23,CASTLE>这种穷乡僻壤来做什么
<2-23,CASTLE>in spanish harlem at this hour of the night?

90
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,688
<2-24,ESPOSITO>可能是因为这是他的球场
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Maybe because it's Cano Vega field.

91
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:25,058
<2-24,ESPOSITO>附近同事说这是他为社区建的
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Local uniforms said that he built it for the community.

92
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:26,616
<2-24,ESPOSITO>想回馈社会
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Wanted to give something back.

93
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,058
<2-25,BECKETT>那么凶手
<2-25,BECKETT>So our killer

94
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,005
<2-25,BECKETT>在这里攻击他
<2-25,BECKETT>hit him from here.

95
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:33,260
<2-26,CASTLE>凶手的鞋上沾到了血
<2-26,CASTLE>And he got blood on his shoe.

96
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,572
<2-27,BECKETT>让鉴证组过来看看
<2-27,BECKETT>Have C.S.U. run a sweep.

97
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,221
<2-27,BECKETT>-看看球场外是否还有血迹  -好的
<2-27,BECKETT>- See if anything tracked outside of the field. - All right.

98
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:40,287
<2-28,ESPOSITO>看来你的身世和电影
<2-28,ESPOSITO>So your dad, what is it,

<2-29,CASTLE>你真得需要闭嘴了
<2-29,CASTLE>You really need to stop talking now.

<2-31,BECKETT>He couldn't have been that easy to kill.

107
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,492
<2-32,CASTLE>除非他完全无心防备
<2-32,CASTLE>Unless he didn't see it coming.

<4-18,MAGGIE>Said he was a lapdog for Fidel.

<5-3,RYAN>文章写的是  维加背叛了整个古巴移民区
<5-3,RYAN>The article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community

169
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,391
<5-3,RYAN>他和那个曾经残杀了无数同胞的
<5-3,RYAN>by shaking hands with the monster

170
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,327

<5-3,RYAN>他将尽己之能唤醒维加对残暴的记忆
<5-3,RYAN>he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty."

174
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,239
<5-4,CASTLE>听起来就是恐吓啊
<5-4,CASTLE>Well, that sounds like a threat to me.

175
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:28,511
<6-1,QUINTANA>我没有恐吓他
<6-1,QUINTANA>I wasn't threatening him.

176
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:31,999
<6-2,BECKETT>你让纽约的古巴移民区对他群起而攻之
<6-2,BECKETT>You turned the local Cuban community against him.

177
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,208
<6-3,QUINTANA>在他对卡斯特罗点头致意时
<6-3,QUINTANA>He turned his back on his people

178
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,984
<6-3,QUINTANA>他就背弃了自己的手足
<6-3,QUINTANA>when he gave Castro his nod of approval.

<6-4,CASTLE>You said it yourself in your editorial,

00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,286
<6-4,CASTLE>维加必须要付出代价
<6-4,CASTLE>Vega should pay.

<6-6,BECKETT>那儿离维加的陈尸地点
<6-6,BECKETT>That's three blocks away

190
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,516
<6-6,BECKETT>只有三个街区
<6-6,BECKETT>from the field where Vega's body was found.

191
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,313
<6-7,QUINTANA>你认为我和他的死有关吗
<6-7,QUINTANA>You think I had something to do with his murder?

192
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,691
<6-8,CASTLE>是的  所谓文字的力量更胜武力
<6-8,CASTLE>Well, the pen is mightier than the sword.

193
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,659
<6-8,CASTLE>但是棒球棒也是个不错的选择
<6-8,CASTLE>But a baseball bat can be pretty effective, too.

194
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,495
<6-9,BECKETT>昨晚7点到10点你在哪里
<6-9,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 7:00 and 10:00 p.M.?

<6-10,QUINTANA>我和妻子待在家里
<6-10,QUINTANA>I was at home with my wife.

196
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,860
<6-11,CASTLE>妻子们总是最好的证明人
<6-11,CASTLE>Mm. Wives make such convenient alibis.

197
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,462
<6-12,QUINTANA>还有我的儿子们
<6-12,QUINTANA>My sons were there as well...

198
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,999
<6-12,QUINTANA>以及我哥哥
<6-12,QUINTANA>As well as my brother.

199
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,014
<6-13,CASTLE>有和你没有血缘关系的证明人吗
<6-13,CASTLE>Do you have anyone who isn't blood related?

200
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:21,121
<6-13,CASTLE>比如说公证人之类
<6-13,CASTLE>A notary, perhaps?

201
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,877
<6-14,QUINTANA>卡尼奥·维加的过错是不可饶恕的
<6-14,QUINTANA>Look, what Cano Vega did is inexcusable.

202
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,548
<6-14,QUINTANA>但我不是凶手
<6-14,QUINTANA>But I am not a murderer.

203
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,358
<6-15,BECKETT>你确定吗  金塔纳先生
<6-15,BECKETT>Are you sure about that, Mr. Quintana?

204
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:33,102
<6-15,BECKETT>是你煽动整个社区的人反对他
<6-15,BECKETT>You incited an entire community against him.

205
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,231
<6-15,BECKETT>在我看来
<6-15,BECKETT>So from where I'm standing,

206
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:36,590
<6-15,BECKETT>你可能不是那个挥棒的人
<6-15,BECKETT>You might not have swung that bat,

207
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,914
<6-15,BECKETT>但并不表示你不是凶手
<6-15,BECKETT>But that doesn't mean that you didn't kill him.

208
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:45,630
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>怎么样
<7-1,MONTGOMERY>Well?

209
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,091
<7-2,BECKETT>动机很明显  但直觉告诉我不是他
<7-2,BECKETT>The trigger is out by, but my gut tells me it's not him.

210
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,561
<7-3,CASTLE>我们需要搜查令
<7-3,CASTLE>We should get a warrant,

211
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,777
<7-3,CASTLE>查查他的捐赠人
<7-3,CASTLE>We'll run his subscribers

212
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:50,808
<7-3,CASTLE>看是否有人发恐吓信给死者
<7-3,CASTLE>against any hate mail that the Vegas might have gotten.

213
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,118
<7-4,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔家族没人是警察吗
<7-4,MONTGOMERY>You sure you got no cop in the Castle family tree?

214
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:53,783
<7-5,CASTLE>不  我们家族的人

<7-6,MONTGROMERY>我想总有几个局里的熟人吧
<7-6,MONTGROMERY>No, I think there's a little cop in there somewhere.

217
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,049
<7-7,BECKETT>老实的艺术家吗
<7-7,BECKETT>Con artists and circus people, huh?

218
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,268
<7-8,CASTLE>是的  还会读心术
<7-8,CASTLE>Yep, and mind readers.

219
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,044
<7-9,BECKETT>真的吗  说说我在想什么
<7-9,BECKETT>Really? So tell me what I'm thinking.

222
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,894
<7-10,CASTLE>你懒得理我  让我闭嘴
<7-10,CASTLE>You don't care and you want me to stop talking.

223
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:14,718
<7-11,BECKETT>天呐  难以置信
<7-11,BECKETT>Oh, that's uncanny.

224
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,415
<7-12,CASTLE>-这是天生的  -贝克特
<7-12,CASTLE>- It's in the blood. - Yo, Beckett.

<7-14,BECKETT>-怎么了  -鉴证小组回复说
<7-14,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Just got back from C.S.U.

226

<7-15,ESPOSITO>他们追踪了球场上凶手鞋底的血迹
<7-15,ESPOSITO>They managed to track the blood trail from the killer's shoe

227
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,525
<7-15,ESPOSITO>但是在路边就消失了
<7-15,ESPOSITO>across the park. It dead-ended at the curb.

228
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,369
<7-16,BECKETT>看来凶手开车逃跑了
<7-16,BECKETT>So our killer was driving a car.

229
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,148
<7-17,ESPOSITO>是的  而且那地方有泥巴
<7-17,ESPOSITO>Yeah. The area was a little muddy,

230
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:28,648
<7-17,ESPOSITO>我们还原了轮胎的部分花纹
<7-17,ESPOSITO>So we were able to pull a partial on the tire.

231
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:29,808
<7-18,BECKETT>做模型了吗
<7-18,BECKETT>Any make a model?

232
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,567
<7-19,ESPOSITO>比模型还好  轮胎的特征独一无二
<7-19,ESPOSITO>Better. The tire marks are distinctive.

233
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:32,931
<7-19,ESPOSITO>上面有两处压力点
<7-19,ESPOSITO>They've been ped in two spots.

234
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,685
<7-19,ESPOSITO>去年的一起恶性伤人案件中的车
<7-19,ESPOSITO>Now those same tire tracks match a car that was tagged

235
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,375
<7-19,ESPOSITO>车胎有相同的特征
<7-19,ESPOSITO>In an aggravated assault last year.

236
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,361
<7-19,ESPOSITO>安东·韦德也是用球棒
<7-19,ESPOSITO>The assault was committed with a baseball bat

237
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,362
<7-20,BECKETT>放高利贷  勒索
<7-20,BECKETT>By one Anton Wade. Loan sharking, blackmail.

238
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,990
<7-21,ESPOSITO>还有一起持致命武器斗殴
<7-21,ESPOSITO>Plus assault with a deadly weapon

239
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,408
<7-21,ESPOSITO>以及两起伤击案
<7-21,ESPOSITO>and two a&b's--

240
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,246
<7-21,ESPOSITO>-就是伤人攻击  -我知道
<7-21,ESPOSITO>- Assault and battery. - I know.

241
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,595
<7-23,ESPOSITO>他是个十足的坏家伙
<7-23,ESPOSITO>Right. The guy's one seriously bad dude.

242
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,971
<7-24,CASTLE>天呐  我突然感觉到些什么了
<7-24,CASTLE>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm sensing something here--

243
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,636
<7-24,CASTLE>这家伙可能就是凶手
<7-24,CASTLE>That... This guy might just be our killer.

244
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,369
<8-1,BECKETT>韦德先生
<8-1,BECKETT>Mr. Wade,

245
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,371
<8-1,BECKETT>我们知道你去过棒球场
<8-1,BECKETT>We have you at the baseball field.

246
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,373
<8-1,BECKETT>你开车到过犯罪现场
<8-1,BECKETT>Your car was at the crime scene,

247
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,575
<8-1,BECKETT>我可不想
<8-1,BECKETT>Not to mention your unfortunate history

248
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,984
<8-1,BECKETT>把你用球棒伤人的恶行一一列出
<8-1,BECKETT>of hitting people with baseball bats.

249
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,432
<8-1,BECKETT>这些足够送你回监狱了
<8-1,BECKETT>All of that's enough to send you away.

250
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:23,386
<8-1,BECKETT>你可以好好和我们合作  或是保持沉默
<8-1,BECKETT>So you can play dumb or you can play ball.

251
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,248
<8-2,CASTLE>这不是开玩笑
<8-2,CASTLE>Pun intended.

252
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,467
<8-3,WADE>好吧  我到过现场  但是我没有杀他
<8-3,WADE>All right, I was there, but I didn't kill him.

253
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:29,880
<8-3,WADE>当时他已经死了
<8-3,WADE>He was already dead.

254
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,554
<8-4,CASTLE>你只是去看看尸体吗
<8-4,CASTLE>You were just paying the corpse a visit.

255
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,725
<8-5,WADE>他打电话给我  让我去见他
<8-5,WADE>He called and asked me to meet up with him.

256
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,681
<8-5,WADE>当我到那里时  发现大事不妙
<8-5,WADE>And when I got there, I knew how it looked.

257
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,746
<8-5,WADE>所以我立马就走了
<8-5,WADE>So I bounced the hell up outta there.

258
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,626
<8-6,BECKETT>为什么维加会打电话给你
<8-6,BECKETT>Why would Vega call you?

259
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,493
<8-7,WADE>他准备还钱给我
<8-7,WADE>He wanted to make a payment on his loan.

260
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,882
<8-7,WADE>以前都是这样的  把钱放在信封里
<8-7,WADE>He always paid the same way, cash in a plain envelope.

261
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,022
<8-7,WADE>我看见信封在他身上  我就拿走了
<8-7,WADE>I saw it on him. I took it.

262
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,764
<8-8,CASTLE>他是个百万富翁
<8-8,CASTLE>The guy's a multimillionaire.

263
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,515
<8-8,CASTLE>而你只不过是个放高利贷的
<8-8,CASTLE>You're a petty loan shark.

264
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:53,851
<8-8,CASTLE>他为什么要向你借钱
<8-8,CASTLE>What's he doing borrowing money from you?

265
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,315
<8-9,WADE>在我们这行  不说不问才能生存
<8-9,WADE>In my business, you don't ask, you don't tell.

266
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:57,657
<8-10,BECKETT>他向你借了多少钱
<8-10,BECKETT>How much money did he borrow?

267
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:00,876
<8-11,WADE>他是两周前找我的
<8-11,WADE>He came to me a couple weeks back,

268
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:01,859
<8-11,WADE>借了20万
<8-11,WADE>Needed 200 grand.

269
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,339
<8-11,WADE>以我的经验看
<8-11,WADE>In my experience...

270
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,905
<8-11,WADE>如果要借那么大一笔钱的话
<8-11,WADE>If you need that kind of coin,

271
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:08,175
<8-11,WADE>他肯定惹上大麻烦了
<8-11,WADE>He got himself into some real bad... Trouble--

272
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,922
<8-11,WADE>某种杀身之祸
<8-11,WADE>The kind of trouble that gets you killed.

273
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,197
<8-12,BECKETT>或者是他还不了债
<8-12,BECKETT>Or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.

274
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,675
<8-13,CASTLE>你给了他  当头一棒
<8-13,CASTLE>And you pulled a little "Untouchables" De niro on his head.

275
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,317
<8-14,WADE>如果一个人欠你钱
<8-14,WADE>A guy owing you money?

276
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,583
<8-14,WADE>杀了他可收不回钱  你可以拿他的珠宝
<8-14,WADE>Killing him ain't gonna get you paid. You take his bling,

277
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:21,917
<8-14,WADE>你可以让他做牛做马
<8-14,WADE>You jack him for his ride,

278
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,117
<8-14,WADE>甚至打碎他的膝盖骨
<8-14,WADE>You maybe even bust his kneecaps.

279
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,974
<8-14,WADE>但他还了尾款
<8-14,WADE>But he made his last installment.

280
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,917
<8-14,WADE>维加信守承诺  我们两清了
<8-14,WADE>Vega made his vig. We were good.

281
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,822
<9-1,BECKETT>维加的妻子根本不知道借钱的事
<9-1,BECKETT>Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.

282
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,571
<9-2,CASTLE>真是怪了去了
<9-2,CASTLE>It doesn't make sense.

283
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,578
<9-2,CASTLE>以卡尼奥·维加的条件
<9-2,CASTLE>With his assets, a guy like Cano Vega

284
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,803
<9-2,CASTLE>他可以向纽约任何一家银行贷款
<9-2,CASTLE>could get a loan from any bank in New York city.

285
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,128
<9-2,CASTLE>他为什么要借20万的高利贷呢
<9-2,CASTLE>So why go to a loan shark for $200,000?

286
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,342
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>可能银行贷款太花时间
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>Because bank loans take time.

287
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,362
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>放高利贷的能马上给钱
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>Loan sharks give it to you right away.

288
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,240
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>可能他急需用钱
<9-3,MONTGOMERY>Maybe he needed the money fast.

289
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,499
<9-4,CASTLE>或者他不想引人注目
<9-4,CASTLE>Maybe he needed it kept quiet.

290
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,938
<9-4,CASTLE>借高利贷不需要办手续和信贷审核
<9-4,CASTLE>Loan sharks don't require paperwork, credit checks.

291
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,595
<9-4,CASTLE>或许他不想让妻子知道
<9-4,CASTLE>Maybe he didn't want his wife to know.

292
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:52,296
<9-5,BECKETT>维加也不想让妻子
<9-5,BECKETT>Vega didn't want his wife

293
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:55,286
<9-5,BECKETT>知道他去古巴的原因
<9-5,BECKETT>to know why he was going to Cuba either.

294
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,942
<9-6,MONTGOMERY>你认为借钱和那趟旅行有关吗
<9-6,MONTGOMERY>So you think his trip and the money are related?

295
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,492
<9-7,BECKETT>是的  他回来一周后
<9-7,BECKETT>Well, a week after he gets back,

296
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,747
<9-7,BECKETT>突然就急需20万
<9-7,BECKETT>He suddenly needs $200,000?

297
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,716
<9-7,BECKETT>理所当然  两者是有关系的
<9-7,BECKETT>It stands to reason that the two were connected somehow.

298
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,052
<9-8,ESPOSITO>我们刚搜查了韦德的公寓
<9-8,ESPOSITO>We just finished a search of Wade's apartment.

299
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,321
<9-8,ESPOSITO>发现了部分相同的鞋印
<9-8,ESPOSITO>We found a match to the partial shoe print.

300
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,323
<9-9,RYAN>但奇怪的是
<9-9,RYAN>Yeah, but here's the weird thing--

301
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:12,694
<9-9,RYAN>鞋底的血迹是吻合的
<9-9,RYAN>It tested positive for blood on the sole,

302
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:14,547
<9-9,RYAN>但是鞋上的血却不吻合
<9-9,RYAN>But negative for blood on the rest of the shoe

303
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:15,602
<9-9,RYAN>清洁剂也不相同
<9-9,RYAN>And negative for cleaning agents.

304
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,204
<9-10,BECKETT>如果韦德杀了维加
<9-10,BECKETT>If Wade killed Vega,

305
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,938
<9-10,BECKETT>他鞋子会沾满血迹
<9-10,BECKETT>Then his shoe would've been covered in blood.

306
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,295
<9-11,CASTLE>所以韦德说的是实话
<9-11,CASTLE>So Wade's telling the truth.

307
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,180
<9-11,CASTLE>他在凶手走后出现
<9-11,CASTLE>He shows up after the murder,

308
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,275
<9-11,CASTLE>踩到了血迹走出公园
<9-11,CASTLE>Tracks some blood outside of the park.

309
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,970
<9-12,BECKETT>而真正的凶手鞋面上有血迹
<9-12,BECKETT>While the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe

310
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,134
<9-12,BECKETT>但几乎没有留下足迹
<9-12,BECKETT>And leaves little or no trail behind.

311
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,075
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>我们查查维加从古巴回来后
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>Let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba

312
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,567
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>-为什么急需那笔钱  -好的
<9-13,MONTGOMERY>- And suddenly needs 200 grand. - Okay.

313
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,549
<9-14,BECKETT>你想从哪着手
<9-14,BECKETT>So where do you want to start?

314
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,106
<9-15,ESPOSITO>你们去查查维加的经济情况
<9-15,ESPOSITO>You guys look into Vega's financials.

315
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,138
<9-16,BECKETT>看看我们遗漏了什么
<9-16,BECKETT>See if we missed anything.

316
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:40,734
<9-16,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔从古巴查起
<9-16,BECKETT>Castle and I will start with Cuba.

317
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,091
<9-17,CASTLE>古巴  不错啊
<9-17,CASTLE>Cuba. Good idea.

318
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,499
<9-17,CASTLE>我喝着甘蔗酒  你就裹着沙滩巾
<9-17,CASTLE>I'll bring the mojitos. You get the beach towels.

319
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,952
<9-18,BECKETT>不知道行不行  卡塞尔
<9-18,BECKETT>Oh, I don't know, Castle.

320
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:49,760
<9-18,BECKETT>让我穿着泳装在烈日下暴晒吗
<9-18,BECKETT>Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun?

321
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,050
<9-19,CASTLE>我很乐意给你擦防晒霜
<9-19,CASTLE>I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.

322
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,385
<9-20,BECKETT>好了  我还是想些
<9-20,BECKETT>That's okay. I was actually thinking

323
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:55,346
<9-20,BECKETT>比较实际的东西
<9-20,BECKETT>of something a little bit more local...

324
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,637
<9-20,BECKETT>比如安排古巴之行的人
<9-20,BECKETT>Like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba.

325
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,966
<9-20,BECKETT>鲍比·福克斯  他的经纪人
<9-20,BECKETT>Bobby Fox, his agent.

326
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:02,733
<9-21,CASTLE>不错的想法
<9-21,CASTLE>That's a good idea.

327
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,788
<9-21,CASTLE>我还是会履行帮涂防晒霜的诺言
<9-21,CASTLE>But the lotion offer still stands.

328
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:06,868
<9-22,BECKETT>不用了  谢谢
<9-22,BECKETT>No, thank you.

329
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:07,925
<9-23,CASTLE>我的手可是很巧的
<9-23,CASTLE>I have very soft hands.

330
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,308
<9-24,CASTLE>什么才是职业运动
<9-24,CASTLE>What is it with professional sports?

331
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,606
<9-24,CASTLE>我是说  连经纪人都注射类固醇
<9-24,CASTLE>I mean, even the agencies are on steroids.

332
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,983
<9-25,BECKETT>福克斯的手上
<9-25,BECKETT>Fox's client list

00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,828
<9-25,BECKETT>可都是名副其实的超级体育明星
<9-25,BECKETT>is a veritable who's who of star athletes.

334
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,110
<9-25,BECKETT>每笔合同和薪水都抽百分之五
<9-25,BECKETT>5% of their endorsements and salaries--

335
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,334
<9-25,BECKETT>他买得起半个曼哈顿区
<9-25,BECKETT>You could pay for half of lower Manhattan.

336
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,093
<9-26,CASTLE>你刚用了"名副其实"这个词吗
<9-26,CASTLE>Did you just use the word "Veritable"?

337
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:25,538
<9-27,BECKETT>是的
<9-27,BECKETT>Yes, I did.

338
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:26,756
<9-28,CASTLE>很性感嘛
<9-28,CASTLE>Sexy.

339
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,206
<9-29,BECKETT>你该听听我说"荒谬至极"
<9-29,BECKETT>You should hear me say "Fallacious."

340
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:29,661
<9-30,RECEPTIONIST>鲍比·福克斯经纪公司
<9-30,RECEPTIONIST>Bobby Fox agency.

341

<9-30,RECEPTIONIST>Please hold. Can I help you?

<9-31,BECKETT>-我要见福克斯先生  -你有预约吗
<9-31,BECKETT>- I need to see Mr. Fox. - Do you have an appointment?

343
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:37,035
<9-33,BECKETT>-我想他能挤出时间的  -是里克吗
<9-33,BECKETT>- I think he can squeeze me in. - Rick?

344
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,652
<9-34,JOE TORRE>-里克·卡塞尔  -你好  队长
<9-34,JOE TORRE>- Rick Castle? - Hey, skipper.

345
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,703
<9-35,CASTLE>自从上次大行动之后都没见过你
<9-35,CASTLE>I have not seen you since the big move.

346
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,230
<9-35,CASTLE>-最近怎么样  乔  -糟糕极了
<9-35,CASTLE>- How are you, Joe? - Pretty awful.

347
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,354
<9-36,TORRE>真不敢相信维加走了
<9-36,TORRE>I just can't believe this whole Vega thing.

348
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:47,019
<9-36,TORRE>我理解
<9-36,TORRE>I know.

349
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,369
<9-37,CASTLE>令人悲伤啊  你们又是好友  我很抱歉
<9-37,CASTLE>It's sad. And you two were friends. I'm--I'm sorry.

350
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,698
<9-38,TORRE>是啊  他是个伟大的小伙
<9-38,TORRE>Yeah, he was a great kid.

351
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:54,567
<9-38,TORRE>他本可成为古巴裔罗伯托·克里米提[拉美裔传奇球员]
<9-38,TORRE>Uh, he had the ability to be a Cuban Roberto Clemente.

352
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:55,679
<9-38,TORRE>真是让人心痛
<9-38,TORRE>It's just been very sad.

353
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,316
<9-39,CASTLE>我们来就是想和福克斯先生谈谈
<9-39,CASTLE>We're actually here to talk to Mr. Fox about it.

354
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,807
<9-39,CASTLE>-这是凯特·贝克特探长  -你好
<9-39,CASTLE>- This is detective Kate Beckett. - Hi.

<9-41,BECKETT>贝克特  凯特  探长
<9-41,BECKETT>Beckett... Kate... Detective.

356

<9-41,BECKETT>谢谢
<9-41,BECKETT>Thank you.

357
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,838
<9-42,TORRE>很高兴认识你
<9-42,TORRE>Very nice meeting you. Okay.

<9-44,TORRE>我也会帮你们祈祷的
<9-44,TORRE>And, uh, I'll say a prayer for you guys.

360
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,443
<9-45,CASTLE>谢了
<9-45,CASTLE>Thanks.

361
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:15,180
<9-46,TORRE>别忘了  代我跟你母亲问好
<9-46,TORRE>By the way, say hi to your mom for me, okay?

362
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,282
<9-47,CASTLE>-我会的  乔  -好的
<9-47,CASTLE>- Will do, Joe.  - Okay.

363
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,984
<9-49,CASTLE>保持冷静
<9-49,CASTLE>Smooth.

364
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,653
<9-50,BECKETT>那个竟然是乔·托利
<9-50,BECKETT>That was Joe-freakin'-Torre.

365
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,100
<9-50,BECKETT>我得马上告诉老爸
<9-50,BECKETT>I gotta call my dad.

366
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,669
<9-51,CASTLE>办公室在
<9-51,CASTLE>The office is over...

367
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,983
<9-51,CASTLE>办公室应该在
<9-51,CASTLE>The off--his office is...

368
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,894
<9-52,FOX>卡尼奥是个好人
<9-52,FOX>He was a good guy--Cano.

369
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:31,775
<9-52,FOX>他建球场是为了回馈社会
<9-52,FOX>He built that field because he wanted to give back.

370
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,485
<9-52,FOX>也正因此才会去古巴
<9-52,FOX>I think that's why he went to cuba.

371
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,960
<9-52,FOX>他想证明自己能造福社会
<9-52,FOX>He wanted to see if he could do something good.

372
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,612
<9-52,FOX>不过我想现实总是事与愿违
<9-52,FOX>But I guess things hadn't changed as much as he had hoped for.

373
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:40,342
<9-53,BECKETT>发生了什么
<9-53,BECKETT>What happened?

374
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,394
<9-54,FOX>他在哈瓦那待了一段时间
<9-54,FOX>He had spent some time in Havana with the people.

375
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,654
<9-54,FOX>回来时心烦意乱  还告诉我
<9-54,FOX>He came back pretty upset, and he told me

376
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,645
<9-54,FOX>让我把签约金退给古巴旅游局
<9-54,FOX>To give the tourism guys back their signing bonus.

377
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,198
<9-54,FOX>那可是我第一次让客人退款
<9-54,FOX>First time I ever let a client give money back.

378
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,547
<9-54,FOX>后来我明白了
<9-54,FOX>But I figured, you know,

379
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:56,859
<9-54,FOX>卡尼奥反对军事独裁
<9-54,FOX>Cano was reneging on a military dictatorship.

380
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,493
<9-54,FOX>但你可不想惹毛这群人
<9-54,FOX>These are not the people you want angry at you,

381
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,452
<9-54,FOX>尤其是已经在18年前成功出逃了
<9-54,FOX>Especially having defected from them 18 years ago.

382
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,867
<9-55,CASTLE>他曾冒着生命危险逃跑
<9-55,CASTLE>He risked his life to leave.

383
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,664
<9-55,CASTLE>你为何又想让他成为新古巴的代言人
<9-55,CASTLE>Why would you want him to be the poster boy for the new cuba?

384
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:10,980
<9-56,FOX>我没有  是他自己想回去
<9-56,FOX>Oh, I didn't. I was just as surprised as anyone

385
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,000
<9-56,FOX>我和其他人一样惊讶
<9-56,FOX>That he wanted to do it.

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,272
<9-56,FOX>还是我千辛万苦把他带出来
<9-56,FOX>After everything I did to get him out back then?

387
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,462
<9-56,FOX>-你听说了吗  -没有
<9-56,FOX>- Have you heard this story? - No.

388
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:18,216
<9-56,FOX>你会喜欢这个故事的  卡塞尔
<9-56,FOX>You're gonna like this, Castle.

389
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:19,094
<9-57,BECKETT>就像你的推理小说
<9-57,BECKETT>It's like one of your books.

390
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,751
<9-58,FOX>92年奥运会时
<9-58,FOX>It was the '92 olympics.

391
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,719
<9-58,FOX>古巴在巴塞罗那拿了金牌
<9-58,FOX>The Cubans had just won gold in Barcelona,

392
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,429
<9-55,CASTLE>都是卡尼奥的功劳
<9-55,CASTLE>Thanks mostly to Cano.

393
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:28,381
<9-56,FOX>所以我想让他到美国来
<9-56,FOX>And I wanted to get him to the states

394
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,306
<9-58,FOX>在大联盟里打球
<9-58,FOX>To play in the bigs.

395
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,303
<9-58,FOX>说服他并不难
<9-58,FOX>Now convincing him was the easy part.

396
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:36,088
<9-58,FOX>难就难在让他登上我的飞机
<9-58,FOX>Getting him onto my plane, that was the hard part.

397
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:39,911
<9-58,FOX>躲过教练和保镖的视线  终于
<9-58,FOX>We had to get past coaches and minders and finally...

398
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,197
<9-58,FOX>碰到了大章鱼[古巴语]
<9-58,FOX>El pulpo,

399
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,409
<9-58,FOX>那个国土安全局局长
<9-58,FOX>Head of state security,

400
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,407
<9-58,FOX>他的触须控制着所有人
<9-58,FOX>Because he had his tentacles around everybody.

401
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:51,401
<9-58,FOX>我们还以为能顺利回国  突然
<9-58,FOX>And just as we thought we were home free--boom!

402
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:53,587
<9-58,FOX>遇到了大章鱼
<9-58,FOX>El pulpo.

403
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,323
<9-58,FOX>我们被抓住了  糟透了
<9-58,FOX>We were caught, sunk.

404
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,417
<9-58,FOX>绝不是开玩笑  当时有支死刑行刑队
<9-58,FOX>A firing squad, I kid you not,

405
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,152
<12-2,BECKETT>就在哈瓦那等着卡尼奥回去受刑
<12-2,BECKETT>Was waiting for that kid back in Havana.

406
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,644
<12-3,MAGGIE>知道怎样解决大章鱼的吗
<12-3,MAGGIE>You know how I got us past el pulpo?

407
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,121
<11-6,ESPOSITO>劳力士
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Rolex.

408
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:07,995
<11-7,RYAN>我把金灿灿的全新劳力士手表给了他
<11-7,RYAN>I gave him my shiny new rolex,

409
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,763
<11-8,BECKETT>他就把头转到一边去了
<11-8,BECKETT>And he just looked the other way.

410
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:13,147
<9-57,BECKETT>这就说明
<9-57,BECKETT>just goes to show you,

411
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,113
<9-58,FOX>社会主义只是资本主义的伪装罢了
<9-58,FOX>Every socialist is a capitalist when backs are turned.

412
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,401
<9-59,BECKETT>他接受那份工作会是因为急需用钱吗
<9-59,BECKETT>Is it possible that he took the Cuba job because he needed the ney?

413
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,744
<9-60,FOX>有这个可能
<9-60,FOX>Well, it's possible, yes.

414
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:23,311
<9-60,FOX>天知道这些人是怎么挥霍的
<9-60,FOX>God knows those guys know how to blow through money.

415
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,335
<9-60,FOX>而且  他和汤米的那家俱乐部
<9-60,FOX>and plus, he has that club with Tommy

416
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,600
<9-60,FOX>根本就是赔本买卖
<9-60,FOX>That's just a money pit.

417
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,624
<9-61,BECKETT>古巴那边的工作安排
<9-61,BECKETT>So in regards to the Cuba job,

418
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,246
<9-61,BECKETT>还有谁和他同行
<9-61,BECKETT>Who else went on this trip?

419
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,576
<9-62,FOX>有一些低级别的古巴外交人员
<9-62,FOX>Well, a couple of low-level Cuban diplomats.

420
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,789
<9-62,FOX>我让辛西娅给你张名单
<9-62,FOX>I'll have, uh, Cynthia get you a list.

421
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,110
<9-63,BECKETT>到底他为什么要去古巴
<9-63,BECKETT>So what made him go to cuba

422
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,315
<9-63,BECKETT>又是什么改变了他的主意
<9-63,BECKETT>And then what made him change his mind?

423
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,058
<9-64,CASTLE>可能维加为国土安全部工作
<9-64,CASTLE>Well, maybe Vega worked for the state department.

424
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,784
<9-64,CASTLE>被派去那里  在和菲德尔·卡斯特罗握手时
<9-64,CASTLE>Maybe he was sent to shake hands with Fidel

425
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,995
<9-64,CASTLE>暗中将生物毒素注入他体内
<9-64,CASTLE>In a secret attempt to release a biotoxin into his system.

426
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:52,388
<9-64,CASTLE>俄罗斯人就用放射钋喷射日本寿司
<9-64,CASTLE>Well, the russians sprayed sushi with radioactive polonium.

427
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,205
<9-64,CASTLE>还有什么更不靠谱的呢
<9-64,CASTLE>What-- what's more farfetched?

428
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,459
<9-65,BECKETT>我都见到了乔·托利  没什么不可能的
<9-65,BECKETT>Well, I just met Joe Torre, so I guess anything's possible.

429
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:04,680
<9-66,PERLMUTTER>贝克特  和预期一样  死因是脑出血
<9-66,PERLMUTTER>Beckett. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhaging, as expected.

430
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,614
<9-67,BECKETT>根据击打的角度推算
<9-67,BECKETT>Any way to estimate the height of the attacker

431
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,922
<9-67,BECKETT>-有办法推断凶手的身高吗  -通常可以
<9-67,BECKETT>- Based on the angle of the blows? - Normally, yes,

432
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,548
<9-68,PERLMUTTER>但是本案中  凶手第一次的击打部位
<9-68,PERLMUTTER>But I-in this case, your attacker's first swing

433
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,403
<9-68,PERLMUTTER>-在头部以下的位置  -有多下面
<9-68,PERLMUTTER>- Landed a little south of his head. - How far south?

434
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,848
<9-70,PERLMUTTER>足以让他变性的部位
<9-70,PERLMUTTER>E-enough to make him a soprano.

435
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:20,093
<9-71,CASTLE>该给他颁个精准奖杯
<9-71,CASTLE>Ow. Shoulda worn a cup.

436

<9-72,PERLMUTTER>膝盖骨的撕裂伤表明  维加头部受击打时
<9-72,PERLMUTTER>Lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees

437

<9-72,PERLMUTTER>是跪在地上的
<9-72,PERLMUTTER>When he was hit on the head.

438
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,539
<9-73,BECKETT>这么说凶手可以是任何人
<9-73,BECKETT>So our attacker could've been anyone?

439
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,148
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>男性  女性甚至是儿童
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>Man, woman or child.

440
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,484
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>但这不是我叫你们来的原因
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>But that's not why I called.

441
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,285
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>在所有新的伤痕中
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>Among all the fresh bruising,

442
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:37,219
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>我发现有几处严重的皮下瘀伤
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>We also found significant subdermal bruises

443
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,268
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>这些都不是新伤
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>That weren't quite as fresh.

444
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,583
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>伤痕都有拳头大小
<9-74,PERLMUTTER>The contusions were all fist sized.

445
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:44,740
<9-75,BECKETT>他跟人打过架
<9-75,BECKETT>He was in a fight.

446
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:45,890
<9-76,PERLMUTTER>遇害的前几天
<9-76,PERLMUTTER>Couple days ago.

447
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,072
<9-77,CASTLE>这个是什么东西的形状
<9-77,CASTLE>What's this shape right here?

448
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,590
<9-78,BECKETT>打他的人带着戒指
<9-78,BECKETT>He was wearing a ring.

449
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,393
<9-79,PERLMUTTER>不是普通戒指
<9-79,PERLMUTTER>Not just any ring.

450
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,095
<9-79,PERLMUTTER>是枚总冠军戒指
<9-79,PERLMUTTER>A championship ring.

451

<9-79,PERLMUTTER>左手无名指

452
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,133
<9-80,CASTLE>正像他的前队友汤米·泽恩
<9-80,CASTLE>Just like his old teammate, free train Tommy Zane.

453
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,683
<10-1,ALEXIS>妈妈一家的家谱能追溯五月花号时代
<10-1,ALEXIS>You know, mom's family goes all the way back to the "Mayflower."

454
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,873
<10-2,CASTLE>她的被害妄想症是遗传的吗
<10-2,CASTLE>What, her persecution complex is genetic?

455
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,075
<10-3,ALEXIS>我也遗传了她的基因
<10-3,ALEXIS>Hey, those are my genes you're talking about,too.

456
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:10,875
<10-4,CASTLE>从好的方面来看
<10-4,CASTLE>Well, look on the bright side.

457
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,998
<10-4,CASTLE>现在你知道自己遗传了这一倾向
<10-4,CASTLE>Now that you know you're genetically predisposed,

458
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,960
<10-4,CASTLE>你可以尽早治疗  以防以后发作
<10-4,CASTLE>You can seek early treatment, prevent future outbreaks.

459
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:18,986
<10-5,ALEXIS>你不觉得困扰吗
<10-5,ALEXIS>Doesn't it bother you

460
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:22,015
<10-5,ALEXIS>不知道自己的父亲是谁
<10-5,ALEXIS>That you don't know who your dad is?

461
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:22,362
<10-5,ALEXIS>不困扰
<10-5,ALEXIS>No.

462
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,059
<10-6,CASTLE>为什么这么问  你觉得困扰吗
<10-6,CASTLE>Why, does it bother you?

463
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,465
<10-7,ALEXIS>是这样的  这个族谱
<10-7,ALEXIS>It's like... I have this family tree,

464
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,402
<10-7,ALEXIS>有一大块是缺失的
<10-7,ALEXIS>And there's a whole chunk of it missing.

465
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,775
<10-7,ALEXIS>我的历史有很长一段根本不曾存在
<10-7,ALEXIS>There's a whole part of my history that doesn't even exist.

466
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,093
<10-7,ALEXIS>奶奶怎么可能不知道
<10-7,ALEXIS>I mean, really, how could gram not know?

467
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,687
<10-8,CASTLE>我大一时  一次去参加派对
<10-8,CASTLE>My first year of college, I, uh, went to a party,

468
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,262
<10-8,CASTLE>遇见一个叫艾莉森的女孩
<10-8,CASTLE>Met this girl--Allison.

469
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,242
<10-8,CASTLE>在短暂的六小时里
<10-8,CASTLE>In the space of six hours,

470
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,867
<10-8,CASTLE>我们相识  相知  共舞
<10-8,CASTLE>we met, we talked, we danced,

471
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,035
<10-8,CASTLE>我们坠入爱河
<10-8,CASTLE>We fell in love.

472
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,112
<10-8,CASTLE>但是第二天早上  她消失了
<10-8,CASTLE>The next morning, she was gone.

473
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,543
<10-8,CASTLE>我花了整整一年的时间寻找她
<10-8,CASTLE>I spent a year trying to find her,

474
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,081
<10-8,CASTLE>我甚至都不知道她姓什么
<10-8,CASTLE>But I never learned her last name.

475
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,617
<10-8,CASTLE>那时我没有一天不想念她
<10-8,CASTLE>There's not a week that goes by I don't think about her.

476
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,873
<10-8,CASTLE>你奶奶告诉我在遇见他的那晚
<10-8,CASTLE>Your gram told me that she loved a lifetime

477
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,321
<10-8,CASTLE>她倾注了此生所有的爱
<10-8,CASTLE>The night she met him.

478
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,821
<10-9,ALEXIS>但是不知道他是谁  你不觉得遗憾吗
<10-9,ALEXIS>Don't you feel like you're missing out, not knowing?

479
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:02,072
<10-10,CASTLE>不  不  这就是神秘的美感
<10-10,CASTLE>No. Oh, no. That's the beauty of the mystery.

480
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,759
<10-10,CASTLE>现在我父亲可以是个宇航员
<10-10,CASTLE>Right now, my father could be an astronaut,

481
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,237
<10-10,CASTLE>海盗  慈善家  甚至是诺贝尔奖得主
<10-10,CASTLE>A pirate, a humanitarian, winner of the nobel prize.

482
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,947
<10-10,CASTLE>有谁比得上这个想象中的父亲呢
<10-10,CASTLE>I mean, what one man could live up to all that?

483
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:12,673
<10-11,ALEXIS>他也会拿着罐头吃生奶油吗
<10-11,ALEXIS>You think he ate whipped cream out of a can?

484
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:15,251
<10-12,CASTLE>没错  因为是他发明了生奶油
<10-12,CASTLE>Yes, and he invented whipped cream.

485
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,106
<10-12,CASTLE>爸爸
<10-12,CASTLE>Dad!

486
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,496
<10-13,ALEXIS>你会吃不下晚餐的
<10-13,ALEXIS>You're gonna spoil your dinner.

<10-14,CASTLE>-这就是我的晚餐  -不是
<10-14,CASTLE>- This is my dinner. - No.

<10-19,ZANE>- Honoring the dead? - Celebrating a life...

493
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,460
<10-19,ZANE>用卡尼奥喜欢的方式庆祝生活
<10-19,ZANE>The way Cano would've wanted it.

494
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:43,931
<10-20,CASTLE>没错  没什么比苹果马提尼更能表达悲伤了
<10-20,CASTLE>Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving" like an appletini.

495
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,653
<10-21,BECKETT>泽恩先生  你肯定是个不记仇的人
<10-21,BECKETT>You must be the "Forgive and forget" type, Mr. Zane,

496
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,014
<10-21,BECKETT>特别是几天前
<10-21,BECKETT>Especially after that beating

497
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,847
<10-21,BECKETT>你狠狠揍了卡尼奥一顿  现在就忘了
<10-21,BECKETT>That you gave Cano a couple of nights ago.

498
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:50,932
<10-22,ZANE>你在胡说什么
<10-22,ZANE>What are you talking about?

499
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,828
<10-23,CASTLE>维加身上有你留下的多处瘀伤
<10-23,CASTLE>We found the bruises left on Vega's body from where you hit him,

500
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,641
<10-23,CASTLE>还包括你的总冠军戒指留下的印记
<10-23,CASTLE>Including the imprints left by your championship ring.

501
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,347
<10-24,ZANE>有25个人有这枚戒指
<10-24,ZANE>25 guys have this ring.

502
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,021
<10-25,CASTLE>他们都把戒指戴在左手无名指吗
<10-25,CASTLE>Do they all wear it on their left-hand ring finger?

503
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:00,995
<10-26,ZANE>有几个
<10-26,ZANE>Some of 'em, yeah.

<10-27,BECKETT>他们的手上都有
<10-27,BECKETT>Do they all have abrasions on that finger

505
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,558
<10-27,BECKETT>对得上号的瘀伤吗
<10-27,BECKETT>That are consistent with assault?

506
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,546
<10-27,BECKETT>泽恩先生  到底发生了什么
<10-27,BECKETT>What happened, Mr. Zane?

507
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,795
<10-27,BECKETT>卡尼奥是不是要从俱乐部撤资
<10-27,BECKETT>Was Cano tired of dumping money into this club?

508
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,259
<10-28,ZANE>-他关心的不是钱  -那是什么
<10-28,ZANE>- He didn't care about the money.  - Then what was it?

509
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,737
<10-30,ZANE>他妻子
<10-30,ZANE>His wife.

<10-31,CASTLE>他妻子  你和她
<10-31,CASTLE>His wife? You and she were--

511
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,555
<10-31,CASTLE>没有
<10-31,CASTLE>No.

512
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,422
<10-32,ZANE>但是他以为我们
<10-32,ZANE>But he thought w--

513
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,309
<10-32,ZANE>玛吉很不难过  她认为
<10-32,ZANE>Maggie was upset, said she thought Cano

514
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,764
<10-32,ZANE>卡尼奥有婚外情  想了解清楚
<10-32,ZANE>Was having an affair and wanted to know

515
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,434
<10-32,ZANE>问我是否看见他和别人在此约会
<10-32,ZANE>If I'd seen him down here at the club with anybody.

516
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,375
<10-33,BECKETT>你怎么告诉她的
<10-33,BECKETT>What'd you tell her?

517
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,489
<10-34,ZANE>-我跟她说没有   -你说的是真话吗
<10-34,ZANE>- I told her no, of course.  - Was that the truth?

518
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,345
<10-35,CASTLE>以前也有过类似情况
<10-35,CASTLE>Look, I've been through this before.

519
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,142
<10-36,ZAE>卡尼奥只是逢场作戏
<10-36,ZAE>Cano was hing some kind of crisis.

520
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,661
<10-36,ZAE>他是不会离开她的
<10-36,ZAE>He wasn't gonna leave her.

521
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:36,884
<10-36,ZAE>没必要告诉她真相
<10-36,ZAE>So why tell her the truth?

522
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,476
<10-37,BECKETT>这么说维加确实有婚外情
<10-37,BECKETT>So Vega was having an affair?

523
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:41,005
<10-38,ZANE>跟一个年轻古巴女孩子
<10-38,ZANE>I'd seen him with a girl-- young, cuban.

524
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,572
<10-38,ZANE>我是后来才发现的  他经常不回家
<10-38,ZANE>You know, I figured after his visit, he was missing home.

525
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,088
<10-38,ZANE>那晚他见我从他家里出来
<10-38,ZANE>Anyway, he saw me leaving his house that night,

526
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,527
<10-38,ZANE>他问玛吉为什么我在
<10-38,ZANE>And when he asked Maggie why I was there,

527
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,245
<10-38,ZANE>她言辞闪烁
<10-38,ZANE>she got evasive.

528
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:51,134
<10-39,CASTLE>自然的  他认为她也有婚外情
<10-39,CASTLE>So naturally, he thought she was having an affair of her own.

529
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,575
<10-40,ZANE>他来找我算帐
<10-40,ZANE>Came after me swinging.

530
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,739
<10-40,ZANE>我给了他肋骨几拳
<10-40,ZANE>Took a couple of shots to his ribs

531
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,057
<10-40,ZANE>让他安静下来听我解释
<10-40,ZANE>to calm him down enough before I could tell him the truth.

532
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,410
<10-41,BECKETT>他约会的姑娘
<10-41,BECKETT>This girl that he was dating,

533
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,084
<10-42,ZANE>-还记得她的名字吗  -不  他没跟我说过
<10-42,ZANE>- do you remember her name? - No, he never told me her name.

534
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,204
<10-42,ZANE>不过我手机里可能有张照片
<10-42,ZANE>But I might have a picture on my phone.

535
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,404
<11-1,RYAN>跟职业运动员和政客在一起会怎样
<11-1,RYAN>What is it with professional athletes and politicians

536
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,536
<11-1,RYAN>他们就是没法不动邪念吗
<11-1,RYAN>that they just can't keep it in their pants?

537
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,007
<11-2,ESPOSITO>只是自我感觉良好  发育过度的青少年
<11-2,ESPOSITO>They're just overgrown teenagers with delicate little egos.

538
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,921
<11-3,BECKETT>没那么深奥  是简单的算术
<11-3,BECKETT>It's not that deep. It's just simple math.

539
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,109
<11-3,BECKETT>他们有更多机会
<11-3,BECKETT>They just have more opportunity.

540
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,369
<11-4,RYAN>你是说  男人是狗
<11-4,RYAN>Well, what are you saying, men are dogs?

541
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:21,035
<11-5,BECKETT>不  机会越大  可能性就越大
<11-5,BECKETT>No. The greater the opportunity, the greater the likelihood.

542
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:22,724
<11-5,BECKETT>意味着你们两个没什么好担心的
<11-5,BECKETT>Which means the two of you have nothing to worry about.

543
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,126
<11-6,ESPOSITO>莱恩没什么好担心的
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Ryan has nothing to worry about.

544
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,420
<11-8,BECKETT>卡尼奥·维加  另一方面...
<11-8,BECKETT>Hey. Cano Vega, on the other hand...

545
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,574
<11-9,ESPOSITO>他妻子说  他从古巴回来性情大变
<11-9,ESPOSITO>His wife said that he changed when he got back from Cuba.

546
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,045
<11-9,ESPOSITO>或许不是因为古巴  是因为那个姑娘
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe it wasn't Cuba. Maybe it was the girl.

547
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,433
<11-10,RYAN>这就能解释那二十万美元了
<11-10,RYAN>That could explain the 200 grand.

548
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,230
<11-10,RYAN>或许是那姑娘需要这笔钱
<11-10,RYAN>Maybe he needed it for the girl.

549
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,746
<11-11,BECKETT>没有找到她  为何他要
<11-11,BECKETT>And why he needed to borrow money from a loan shark

550
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,122
<11-11,BECKETT>-向高利贷借钱  -但玛吉·维加知道了
<11-11,BECKETT>- without her finding out. - But Maggie Vega did find out.

551
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,755
<11-12,CASTLE>于是  她决定不再忍受
<11-12,CASTLE>So she decides she's not gonna take it anymore.

552
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,658
<11-12,CASTLE>考虑离婚
<11-12,CASTLE>She considers divorce,

553
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,305
<11-12,CASTLE>可又想到没完没了的调查
<11-12,CASTLE>But thought about the endless hours of scrutiny,

554
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:46,851
<11-12,CASTLE>媒体上的公开丑闻
<11-12,CASTLE>the public humiliation in the media.

555
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,200
<11-13,ESPOSITO>而且她只能分到一半财产
<11-13,ESPOSITO>Not to mention that she'd only get half.

556
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,714
<11-14,RYAN>假设没有婚前协议的话
<11-14,RYAN>Uh, assuming there's no prenup.

557
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,767
<11-15,BECKETT>如果她杀死了丈夫  就能得到一切
<11-15,BECKETT>But if she kills him, she gets everything.

558
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,995
<11-16,CASTLE>她知道他要去哪里
<11-16,CASTLE>Mm-hmm. She knows where he's gonna be,

559
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,852
<11-16,CASTLE>晚上  一个人
<11-16,CASTLE>Alone, at night.

560
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:57,855
<11-16,CASTLE>她去了那里
<11-16,CASTLE>She goes there.

561
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,179
<11-16,CASTLE>他信任妻子  放松了警惕
<11-16,CASTLE>He trusts her, lets his guard down.

562
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,040
<11-16,CASTLE>她靠近了
<11-16,CASTLE>She moves in close.

563
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,058
<11-17,BECKETT>微笑着  捡起棒球棍
<11-17,BECKETT>She smiles, picks up a bat,

564
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,930
<11-17,BECKETT>想着他对自己所做的一切
<11-17,BECKETT>Thinks of everything that he's done to her,

565
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,282
<11-17,BECKETT>从家庭幸福开始
<11-17,BECKETT>Starts with the family jewels

566
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,503
<11-17,BECKETT>以家庭财富而告终
<11-17,BECKETT>And ends with the family fortune.

567
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,000
<12-1,MAGGIE>胡扯八道  我为什么要谋杀亲夫
<12-1,MAGGIE>This is crazy. Why would I kill my husband?

568
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,819
<12-2,BECKETT>因为你觉得他有婚外情
<12-2,BECKETT>Because you thought he was having an affair.

569
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,621
<12-3,MAGGIE>你们知道了
<12-3,MAGGIE>You know?

570
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,459
<12-4,BECKETT>-怎么知道的  -别管我们怎么知道的
<12-4,BECKETT>- How? - It doesn't matter how we know.

571
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,520
<12-4,BECKETT>-重点是你没告诉我们  -这是我和卡尼奥的
<12-4,BECKETT>- What matters is that you didn't tell us. - It was a private matter

572
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,611
<12-5,MAGGIE>-个人隐私  -也是动机
<12-5,MAGGIE>- between Cano and me. - It's also motive.

573
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,505
<12-6,BECKETT>维加夫人  你丈夫遇害当晚
<12-6,BECKETT>Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night

574
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,424
<12-6,BECKETT>-你在哪里  -一个人在家
<12-6,BECKETT>- of your husband's murder? - At home alone.

575
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,578
<12-7,MAGGIE>如果你想  可以看监控录像
<12-7,MAGGIE>You can check the security tapes if you want.

576
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:38,952
<12-7,MAGGIE>那么...  那是真的
<12-7,MAGGIE>So... It's true then?

577
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:40,594
<12-7,MAGGIE>他有外遇了吗
<12-7,MAGGIE>He was seeing someone else?

578
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,165
<12-8,CASTLE>我们还不能肯定
<12-8,CASTLE>We don't know that for sure.

579
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:45,308
<12-8,CASTLE>我能肯定
<12-8,CASTLE>I do.

580
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,028
<12-9,MAGGIE>他爱上了这个女人
<12-9,MAGGIE>He was in love with her.

581
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:53,750
<12-9,MAGGIE>她叫莱拉
<12-9,MAGGIE>Her name is Lara.

582
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:55,722
<12-9,MAGGIE>米·卡利妮奥  意思是"我的至爱"
<12-9,MAGGIE>Mi Carinio. It means "My love."

583
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,714
<12-10,CASTLE>她是谁  不知道
<12-10,CASTLE>Who is she? I don't know.

584
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,904
<12-11,MAGGIE>为了找线索我把房子翻了个遍
<12-11,MAGGIE>I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue.

585
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,654
<12-11,MAGGIE>唯一找到的就是这张字条
<12-11,MAGGIE>That note is the only thing I've found.

586
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,026
<12-12,CASTLE>2月16号  遇害的两天前
<12-12,CASTLE>"2/16"--that's the day before the murder.

587
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,249
<12-13,MAGGIE>他那天进城的  直到十点半才回家
<12-13,MAGGIE>He went into the city that day, didn't get home until 10:30.

588
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:11,960
<12-13,MAGGIE>所以我知道
<12-13,MAGGIE>That's why I knew.

589
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,524
<12-14,BECKETT>维加夫人  这个女人很可能涉嫌
<12-14,BECKETT>Mrs. Vega, this woman is possibly involved

590
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:15,667
<12-14,BECKETT>你丈夫的谋杀
<12-14,BECKETT>in your husband's murder.

591
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:16,792
<12-14,BECKETT>之前为何不告诉我们
<12-14,BECKETT>Why didn't you tell us this before?

592
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:18,869
<12-15,MAGGIE>因为我...
<12-15,MAGGIE>Because I...

593
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,367
<12-15,MAGGIE>我不希望这是真的
<12-15,MAGGIE>I just didn't want it to be true.

594
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,897
<13-1,RYAN>家庭监控录像证明了维加夫人的话
<13-1,RYAN>Home security videos confirm Mrs. Vega's story,

595
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,585
<13-1,RYAN>汤米·泽恩家的血样  鉴定组测试不符
<13-1,RYAN>And C.S.U. Tested negative for blood at Tommy Zane's place.

596
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:30,947
<13-2,BECKETT>那个姑娘查得怎么样了
<13-2,BECKETT>Where are we on the girl?

597
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,901
<13-3,ESPOSITO>刚搜索完维加的互联网记录
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Just finished combing through Vega's internet records.

598
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,311
<13-3,ESPOSITO>不管电邮还是网络通讯
<13-3,ESPOSITO>There are no I.M.S, e-mails

599
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:37,663
<13-3,ESPOSITO>他跟莱拉没有任何形式的联系
<13-3,ESPOSITO>connecting him in any way, shape or form to a Lara.

600
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:38,735
<13-4,RYAN>电话调查也一无所获
<13-4,RYAN>Phones are a dead end, too.

601
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,003
<13-4,RYAN>过去两个月里  他并没有
<13-4,RYAN>No one who called or was called by Vega in the last two months

602
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:43,579
<13-4,RYAN>和某个莱拉通过电话
<13-4,RYAN>Remembers him mentioning anyone named Lara

603
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,635
<13-5,CASTLE>这个家伙如果是恋爱了
<13-5,CASTLE>Well, for a guy who's supposedly in love,

604
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,899
<13-5,CASTLE>跟姑娘可是没保持密切联系
<13-5,CASTLE>He doesn't do a very good job keeping in touch with his girl.

605
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,123
<13-6,RYAN>有的人要绝望了  亲爱的
<13-6,RYAN>Some guys are just hopeless. Hey, honey.

606
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,712
<13-6,RYAN>是啊  想你了  觉得该给你打个电话
<13-6,RYAN>Yeah, I was just thinking about you, thought I'd call you.

607
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,722
<13-6,RYAN>只想告诉你我想你了
<13-6,RYAN>Well, I just wanted to call to say I miss you.

608
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,066
<13-7,ESPOSITO>-是啊  -有的人真可悲
<13-7,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. - Some guys are just pathetic.

609
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:01,123
<13-9,CASTLE>别妒忌  他还是喜欢你的
<13-9,CASTLE>Don't be jealous. He still loves you.

610
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,778
<13-10,BECKETT>维加死前一天见过她
<13-10,BECKETT>Vega met with her the day before he died,

611
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,634
<13-10,BECKETT>把照片发到所有辖区
<13-10,BECKETT>So let's put photos out to all precincts

612
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,066
<13-10,BECKETT>让同事们详细调查球场周围的区域
<13-10,BECKETT>And have uniforms canvass the area around the field.

613
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,849
<13-10,BECKETT>-说不定案发当晚有人见过她  -贝克特
<13-10,BECKETT>- Maybe somebody saw her the night that he was killed. - Beckett.

614
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:11,793
<13-12,BECKETT>-是  长官  -古巴方面查得怎么样了
<13-12,BECKETT>- Yes, sir. - How we doing on the Cuba angle?

615
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:13,828
<13-13,MONTGOMERY>还没有进展  怎么了
<13-13,MONTGOMERY>Nothinyet. Why?

616
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,952
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>刚接到新泽西州尤尼恩市警局的电话
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>Just got a call from the lieu over in Union City, New Jersey.

617
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,704
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>维加曾在小哈瓦那区的餐馆
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>Vega was involved in a shouting match

618
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,007
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>跟他们的一个老主顾争吵
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>at a restaurant in little Havana with one of their regulars.

619
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,725
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>然后报警叫警察来劝架
<13-15,MONTGOMERY>Apparently the cops were called in to break it up.

620
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,259
<13-16,BECKETT>为何没有事件报告
<13-16,BECKETT>Why wasn't there an incident report?

621
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,483
<13-17,MONTGOMERY>那时候警察应古巴领事馆的请求
<13-17,MONTGOMERY>Cops kept it quiet at the time at the request

622
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:26,942
<13-18,CASTLE>-保持沉默  -因为维加
<13-18,CASTLE>- of the Cuba consulate. -Because of Vega?

623
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,730
<13-19,MONTGOMERY>不  是因为跟维加争吵的人
<13-19,MONTGOMERY>No, because of who Vega was fighting with.

624
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,883
<13-19,MONTGOMERY>马里奥·桑切兹   驻纽约古巴大使馆负责人
<13-19,MONTGOMERY>Mario Sanchez--head of the Cuba consulate in New York.

625
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,247
<13-20,BECKETT>他是带维加去古巴的外交官之一
<13-20,BECKETT>He was one of the diplomats that took Vega to Cuba.

626
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:34,978
<13-21,CASTLE>他们吵什么
<13-21,CASTLE>What did they fight about?

627
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,883
<13-22,MONTGOMERY>不知道  既然他们一起去了古巴
<13-22,MONTGOMERY>I don't know, but seeing that they were in Cuba together,

628
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,449
<13-22,MONTGOMERY>我建议你们去查个究竟
<13-22,MONTGOMERY>I suggest you find out.

629
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,475
<13-23,SANCHEZ>17号晚上  我在大使馆
<13-23,SANCHEZ>On the night of the 17th, I was here at the consulate.

630
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,937
<13-23,SANCHEZ>你们不会以为我杀了卡尼奥·维加吧
<13-23,SANCHEZ>You don't really think I killed Cano Vega, do you?

631
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,598
<13-24,BECKETT>考虑到他在古巴改变心意  无法想象
<13-24,BECKETT>Given his change of heart in Cuba, I can't imagine

632
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:58,111
<13-24,BECKETT>你们俩曾是最好的朋友
<13-24,BECKETT>that the two of you were the best of friends.

633
00:23:58,111 --> 00:23:59,304
<13-25,SANCHEZ>纽约的这些古巴移民
<13-25,SANCHEZ>You could say the same thing

634
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,926
<13-25,SANCHEZ>也还不是如此
<13-25,SANCHEZ>about most of the Cuban community here.

635
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,963
<13-26,CASTLE>是的  可有多少人是跟你在餐馆
<13-26,CASTLE>Yes, but how many of them ended up dead

636
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,291
<13-26,CASTLE>争吵后以死亡告终的
<13-26,CASTLE>After fighting with you in a restaurant?

637
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,013
<13-27,SANCHEZ>我在忙自己的事
<13-27,SANCHEZ>I was minding my own business.

638
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,142
<13-27,SANCHEZ>-维加才是挑起事端的人  -为什么
<13-27,SANCHEZ>- Vega was the one who decided to pick a fight with me. - Why?

639
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,879
<13-29,SANCHEZ>我负责他在古巴的行程
<13-29,SANCHEZ>I was in charge of his schedule in Cuba.

640
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,754
<13-29,SANCHEZ>我猜他可能不喜欢被牵着鼻子走吧
<13-29,SANCHEZ>I guess he didn't like to be told what to do or where to go.

641
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,427
<13-30,CASTLE>听起来像是你给他拴了条链子
<13-30,CASTLE>Sounds like you kept him on a pretty tight leash.

642
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,115
<13-31,SANCHEZ>我们一反常态
<13-31,SANCHEZ>We did a counterrevolutionary the courtesy

643
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:21,634
<13-31,SANCHEZ>礼貌的允许他进入我们的国土
<13-31,SANCHEZ>of allowing him back on our soil.

644
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,249
<13-31,SANCHEZ>我们可不想让他四处闲逛
<13-31,SANCHEZ>We weren't about to just let him wander around.

645
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,957
<13-32,BECKETT>你比任何人都清楚
<13-32,BECKETT>So you would know better than anyone else

646
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,639
<13-32,BECKETT>-维加旅行时做过什么  -那是我的工作
<13-32,BECKETT>- What Vega did on his trip? - That's my job.

647
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,320
<13-34,CASTLE>我们问过的每个人都说
<13-34,CASTLE>Everyone we've spoke to about Vega

648
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,309
<13-34,CASTLE>维加从古巴回来性情大变
<13-34,CASTLE>Says he came back from Cuba a different man.

649
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:34,946
<13-34,CASTLE>他在那里到底出了什么事
<13-34,CASTLE>What happened to him down there?

650
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,007
<13-35,SANCHEZ>他很激动
<13-35,SANCHEZ>he was very emotional

651
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,346
<13-35,SANCHEZ>他在那里的所有时间
<13-35,SANCHEZ>The whole time he was there--

652
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,928
<13-35,SANCHEZ>都在跟当地人交谈  对他们感到抱歉
<13-35,SANCHEZ>Uh, talking to the locals, feeling sorry for them

653
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,712
<13-35,SANCHEZ>为他们的穷困和自己的富有
<13-35,SANCHEZ>Because they were poor and he was rich.

654
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,866
<13-35,SANCHEZ>事实是  他有负罪感
<13-35,SANCHEZ>Truth is, he felt guilty.

655
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,769
<13-36,BECKETT>当维加回来后  借了二十万现金
<13-36,BECKETT>When returned, he borrowed $200,000 in cash.

656
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:50,856
<13-36,BECKETT>有可能
<13-36,BECKETT>Is it possible

657
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,452
<13-36,BECKETT>他想给这个岛集资
<13-36,BECKETT>that he was trying to funnel money to the island,

658
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:55,201
<13-37,SANCHEZ>-帮助一些当地人吗  -我不知道
<13-37,SANCHEZ>-Help some of the locals out, maybe? -Not on my watch.

659
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,229
<13-38,CASTLE>是啊  你无法掌控
<13-38,CASTLE>Yeah, you can't have that.

660
00:24:57,387 --> 00:24:59,125
<13-38,CASTLE>有钱人分享他们的财富  很像社会主义
<13-38,CASTLE>Rich people sharing their wealth? That's like socialism.

661
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,250
<13-38,CASTLE>得了吧
<13-38,CASTLE>Please.

662
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,285
<13-39,SANCHEZ>事实是正像美国人  卡尼奥·维加被惯坏了
<13-39,SANCHEZ>The truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled.

663
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,224
<13-39,SANCHEZ>当他眼前出现贫瘠时
<13-39,SANCHEZ>When the poverty was before his eyes--

664
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:07,658
<13-39,SANCHEZ>是无法形容的悲惨
<13-39,SANCHEZ>It's an unspeakable tragedy.

665
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,057
<13-39,SANCHEZ>然而  眼不见心不烦
<13-39,SANCHEZ>And then, out of sight, out of mind.

666
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:13,897
<13-39,SANCHEZ>他不知道我有所觉察
<13-39,SANCHEZ>He didn't know that I was aware,

667
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,783
<13-39,SANCHEZ>你们想知道
<13-39,SANCHEZ>But do you want to know

668
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,663
<13-39,SANCHEZ>维加最关心古巴的什么事情吗
<13-39,SANCHEZ>the thing that interested Vega most about Cuba?

669
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,352
<14-1,BECKETT>一个姑娘
<14-1,BECKETT>A girl.

670
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:22,807
<13-40,BECKETT>什么姑娘
<13-40,BECKETT>What girl?

671
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,155
<13-41,SANCHEZ>他见过很多当地人  吻过很多孩子
<13-41,SANCHEZ>He met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies.

672
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,467
<13-41,SANCHEZ>我只能假设他在岛内旅游时
<13-41,SANCHEZ>I can only assume it was a pretty young thing

673
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:30,786
<13-41,SANCHEZ>遇到一个漂亮的姑娘
<13-41,SANCHEZ>He met while he was touring the island.

674
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:31,898
<13-42,BECKETT>知道她的名字吗
<13-42,BECKETT>Do you know her name?

675
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,240
<13-43,SANCHEZ>莱拉
<13-43,SANCHEZ>Lara.

676
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:35,611
<13-43,SANCHEZ>她名叫莱拉
<13-43,SANCHEZ>Her name was Lara.

677
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,716
<14-1,BECKETT>维加在古巴爱上了一个姑娘
<14-1,BECKETT>So Vega fell in love with a girl in Cuba.

678
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,451
<14-2,CASTLE>如果你相信桑切兹说的话
<14-2,CASTLE>If you take Sanchez's word.

679
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,779
<14-3,BECKETT>他不可能凭空说出莱拉这名字
<14-3,BECKETT>Well, he couldn't have just pulled the name Lara out of thin air.

680
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,605
<14-4,CASTLE>根据他妻子找到的字条
<14-4,CASTLE>According to the note that the wife found,

681
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,729
<14-4,CASTLE>维加在遇害前一晚和莱拉应该见过面
<14-4,CASTLE>Vega and Lara were supposed to meet the night before he was murdered.

682
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,120
<14-4,CASTLE>如果她在古巴
<14-4,CASTLE>Now how are they supposed to do that

683
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,685
<14-5,BECKETT>-他们怎么见面  -如果她在岛上
<14-5,BECKETT>-if she's stuck in Cuba? -If she's stuck on the island,

684
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,542
<14-5,BECKETT>怎么会跟维加在俱乐部照相
<14-5,BECKETT>How did she end up in that photo with Vega at his club?

685
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,008
<14-6,CASTLE>肯定有个理由能解释一切
<14-6,CASTLE>There has to be an explanation that makes this all make sense.

686
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:03,465
<14-7,ESPOSITO>有  照片里站在维加旁的不是莱拉
<14-7,ESPOSITO>There is. The woman standing next to Vega in the picture is not Lara.

687
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,189
<14-7,ESPOSITO>维加被杀的棒球场附近  有居民认出了她
<14-7,ESPOSITO>A resident near the ballpark where Vega was killed I.D.'ed her.

688
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,784
<14-7,ESPOSITO>她叫阿娜  阿娜·蕾维拉
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Her names Ana, Ana Rivera.

689
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:09,567
<14-7,ESPOSITO>她是社区俱乐部的服务生
<14-7,ESPOSITO>She's a waitress in the neighborhood.

690
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,060
<14-7,ESPOSITO>同事正把她带过来
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Uniforms are bringing her in now.

691
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:12,378
<14-8,BECKETT>她和维加有什么关系
<14-8,BECKETT>What's her connection to Vega?

692
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:15,118
<14-9,ESPOSITO>古巴  半年前她从古巴逃来纽约
<14-9,ESPOSITO>Cuba. She escaped six months ago.

693
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:19,567
<15-1,ANA>我工作的酒吧和他的球场很近
<15-1,ANA>We met at a bar where I work,

694
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,706
<15-1,ANA>我们就在那里认识的
<15-1,ANA>near his field.

695
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,957
<15-1,ANA>他听说我去年才从古巴过来
<15-1,ANA>He heard I'd just come over from Cuba last year,

696
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,508
<15-1,ANA>就请我出去喝几杯
<15-1,ANA>and he invited me out for drinks.

697
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,042
<15-2,BECKETT>你知道他已婚吗
<15-2,BECKETT>Did you know he was married?

698
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,279
<15-2,BECKETT>我们不是那种关系
<15-2,BECKETT>It wasn'like that.

699
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,567
<15-3,ANA>他只想聊天  聊家乡
<15-3,ANA>He just wanted to talk... about home.

700
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,227
<15-3,ANA>他想家  我觉得因此他才回了古巴
<15-3,ANA>He missed it. I think that's why he wanted to go.

701
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,253
<15-4,CASTLE>他从古巴回来后与你合影
<15-4,CASTLE>You were photographed with him after the trip.

702
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,457
<15-4,CASTLE>那时他也仅仅只想聊天吗
<15-4,CASTLE>Did he still want to... just talk?

703
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:41,596
<15-5,ANA>是的  他想知道我是怎么
<15-5,ANA>Yes. He wanted to talk about

704
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,889
<15-5,ANA>从古巴来到这里的
<15-5,ANA>my trip here from Cuba.

705
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,532
<15-5,ANA>不是爱上我  只为知道我是怎么出境的
<15-5,ANA>It was like he was obsessed. He wanted to know how I got out.

706
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,847
<15-6,BECKETT>你对他怎么说的
<15-6,BECKETT>And what did you tell him?

707
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:52,738
<15-6,BECKETT>阿娜  你对维加先生怎么说的
<15-6,BECKETT>Ana, what did you tell Mr. Vega?

708
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,425
<15-7,ANA>我说我家人认识一个熟人
<15-7,ANA>I said my family knew a man.

709
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,479
<15-7,ANA>只要你给得起钱
<15-7,ANA>If--if you pay him lots of money,

710
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:00,468
<15-7,ANA>米·卡利妮奥就能带你去美国
<15-7,ANA>Mi Carinio comes and takes you to America.

711
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:02,840
<15-8,BECKETT>米·卡利妮奥是什么
<15-8,BECKETT>Mi Carinio?

712
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,358
<15-9,ANA>他的船
<15-9,ANA>His boat.

713
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:05,724
<15-9,ANA>人先坐船到牙买加
<15-9,ANA>It takes you to Jamaica,

714
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,436
<15-9,ANA>然后再坐飞机到美国
<15-9,ANA>and then you fly to America.

715
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,170
<15-9,ANA>入境一定要乘飞机  因为如果乘船
<15-9,ANA>It's important that you fly, because if you come by boat,

716
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,597
<15-9,ANA>他们就会把你遣送回国
<15-9,ANA>then they can send you back.

717
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,287
<15-10,BECKETT>这是海路陆路入境政策
<15-10,BECKETT>That's the wet-foot, dry-foot policy.

718
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,166
<15-11,CASTLE>维加在想办法让新女友离开古巴
<15-11,CASTLE>Vega was looking for a way to get his new girlfriend out of Cuba.

719
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,243
<15-12,BECKETT>米·卡利妮奥  2月16日  下午八点半
<15-12,BECKETT>"Mi Carinio ," 2/16, 8:30 p.m.

720
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:23,667
<15-12,BECKETT>他似乎成功了
<15-12,BECKETT>It looks like he succeeded.

721
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,837
<15-13,CASTLE>米·卡利妮奥  2月16日到达牙买加
<15-13,CASTLE>"Mi Carinio" to Jamaica 2/16,

722
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:28,662
<15-13,CASTLE>这意味着她17日到达
<15-13,CASTLE>which means she arrived on the 17th.

723
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,682
<15-13,CASTLE>恰好是维加遇害当天 这不是巧合
<15-13,CASTLE>That's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.

724
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:34,236
<15-14,BECKETT>阿娜  你告诉了维加先生如何联系
<15-14,BECKETT>Ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch

725
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,641
<15-14,BECKETT>帮你离开古巴的人吗
<15-14,BECKETT>with the man who got you out of Cuba.

726
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,750
<15-15,ANA>是的  他主编一份报纸
<15-15,ANA>Yes. He runs a newspaper.

727
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,063
<15-15,ANA>《新希望》报纸  在98街东段
<15-15,ANA>"Una nueva esperanza," on East 98th.

728
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,403
<15-16,BECKETT>主编是阿尔弗雷多·金塔纳吗
<15-16,BECKETT>Alfredo Quintana, the editor?

729
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:50,872
<15-16,BECKETT>他对我们撒谎了
<15-16,BECKETT>He lied to us.

730
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:55,153
<15-17,QUINTANA>一开始你们指控我谋杀维加
<15-17,QUINTANA>All right, first you accuse me of killing Vega.

731
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,189
<15-17,QUINTANA>后来你们又说我在帮他
<15-17,QUINTANA>Then you're saying that I'm helping him.

732
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:59,754
<15-17,QUINTANA>也许你们先该想到清楚明白
<15-17,QUINTANA>So maybe you guys should make up your mind.

733
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:01,226
<15-18,CASTLE>事实上  我们一看到你账户上
<15-18,CASTLE>Well, actually, we made up our minds

734
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,869
<15-18,CASTLE>那二十万就清楚明白了
<15-18,CASTLE>once we saw the $200,000 in your bank account.

735
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,943
<15-19,BECKETT>卡尼奥·维加向高利贷借就是这个数目
<15-19,BECKETT>That's the exact amount Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark.

736
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:08,590
<15-20,CASTLE>因为你们在做违法勾当
<15-20,CASTLE>Since what you were doing was illegal,

737
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,238
<15-20,CASTLE>所以他不想留下证据
<15-20,CASTLE>he didn't want there to be any record of it.

738
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:11,695
<15-21,QUINTANA>我不明白你在说什么
<15-21,QUINTANA>You know, I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,131
<15-21,QUINTANA>这些不是我的账户
<15-21,QUINTANA>These aren't my accounts.

740
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:22,296
<15-21,QUINTANA>这是基金会的账户
<15-21,QUINTANA>This is the foundation's account.

741
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:23,403
<15-21,QUINTANA>上面甚至没有我的名字
<15-21,QUINTANA>My name isn't even on them.

742
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,301
<15-22,CASTLE>这就是你把赃款藏于其中的原因
<15-22,CASTLE>Which is why you hid the money there,

743
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,533
<15-22,CASTLE>让我们更难找到
<15-22,CASTLE>to make it harder for us to find.

744
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,348
<15-23,QUINTANA>这些是慈善捐款
<15-23,QUINTANA>These were charitable contributions.

745
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,945
<15-24,BECKETT>那个女孩在哪里
<15-24,BECKETT>Where's the girl?

746
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:31,960
<15-25,QUINTANA>什么女孩
<15-25,QUINTANA>What girl?

747
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:35,178
<15-26,BECKETT>金塔纳先生  你和你的基金会
<15-26,BECKETT>Mr. Quintana, you and your foundation

748
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,335
<15-26,BECKETT>将面临偷运人口的指控
<15-26,BECKETT>are facing human smuggling charges.

749
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,283
<15-26,BECKETT>你希望再加上妨碍司法公正
<15-26,BECKETT>Do you really want me to add obstruction of justice

750
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,696
<15-26,BECKETT>援助和教唆谋杀罪吗
<15-26,BECKETT>and aiding and abetting a murderer to that?

751
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,080
<15-26,BECKETT>你喜欢出版事业  对吧
<15-26,BECKETT>You like the press, don't you?

752
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:50,624
<15-26,BECKETT>那喜欢涉嫌谋杀卡尼奥·维加吗
<15-26,BECKETT>How are you gonna like being linked to Cano Vega's murder?

753
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:52,586
<15-27,QUINTANA>你知道他们会怎么想吗
<15-27,QUINTANA>You know what they'll see?

754
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:56,071
<15-27,QUINTANA>我从卡斯特罗的独裁下拯救了一个女孩
<15-27,QUINTANA>That I saved a girl from under Castro's regime.

755
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,241
<15-28,CASTLE>收费的
<15-28,CASTLE>For a price.

756
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:58,016
<15-29,QUINTANA>我本打算免费的
<15-29,QUINTANA>Yeah, I would've done it for free.

757
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,341
<15-30,CASTLE>但你没有
<15-30,CASTLE>Yeah, but you didn't.

758
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,835
<15-31,BECKETT>你真的准备把下半生赌在
<15-31,BECKETT>Are you really ready to stake your entire future

759
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,198
<15-31,BECKETT>某个你陌生女孩身上吗
<15-31,BECKETT>on some girl you don't even know?

760
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:10,048
<15-32,QUINTANA>维加给她买了一套公寓
<15-32,QUINTANA>Vega had an apartment for her.

761
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,117
<15-32,QUINTANA>她一到美国我就把她带到了那里
<15-32,QUINTANA>I took her there when I got her to the mainland.

762
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,968
<15-34,QUINTANA>-在哪里  -尤尼恩市萨米特大道
<15-34,QUINTANA>- Where? - Union City, Summit Avenue.

763
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,919
<15-35,MAN>纽约警察  纽约警察
<15-35,MAN>Nypd! Nypd! Nypd! Police! Police! Police! Police! Nypd! Nypd!

764
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:27,840
<15-36,BECKETT>-没人  -没人
<15-36,BECKETT>- Clear. - Clear.

765
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:33,152
<15-37,ESPOSITO>屋里似乎没人
<15-37,ESPOSITO>Looks like nobody's home.

766
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,568
<15-38,CASTLE>可怜的女孩需要去宜家买点东西
<15-38,CASTLE>This girl's in dire need of a trip to Ikea.

767
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:37,545
<15-39,BECKETT>这张床从未铺过
<15-39,BECKETT>This bed hasn't even been made.

768
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,844
<15-39,BECKETT>我觉得她不住这里
<15-39,BECKETT>I don't think she was sleeping here.

770
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,024
<15-40,RYAN>像是泥
<15-40,RYAN>Looks like dirt.

771
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:45,858
<15-41,BECKETT>让鉴证组过来
<15-41,BECKETT>Get C.S.U. down here.

772
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,033
<15-42,RYAN>大家看
<15-42,RYAN>You guys.

773
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:56,365
<15-43,BECKETT>这有血迹
<15-43,BECKETT>There's blood.

774
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:58,082
<15-44,PERLMUTTER>绝对是维加的
<15-44,PERLMUTTER>It's definitely Vega's.

775
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,553
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>-脚印呢  -那就很难确定了
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>- And the footprint? - That's harder to nail down.

776
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:02,886
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>泥土的成分
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>The composition of the dirt

777
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,702
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>和城区各处的泥土都很相似
<15-46,PERLMUTTER>is pretty similar to dirt anywhere in the city.

778
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,758
<15-47,BECKETT>所以不能证明她在现场吗
<15-47,BECKETT>So we can't actually prove that she was at the scene?

779
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:07,683
<15-48,PERLMUTTER>我只是说很难确定
<15-48,PERLMUTTER>I just said it's harder.

780
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:10,669
<15-48,PERLMUTTER>但泥土里含有微量二氧化钛
<15-48,PERLMUTTER>But there were traces of titanium dioxide in the dirt.

781
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:14,143
<15-50,BECKETT>-粉笔  -在棒球场上用来画线的
<15-50,BECKETT>- Chalk. - Like what they use to trace lines on baseball fields.

782
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,952
<15-51,CASTLE>所以她去了棒球场
<15-51,CASTLE>So she heads to the field,

783
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,945
<15-51,CASTLE>用球棒打了维加的头
<15-51,CASTLE>takes a little batting practice on Vega's head,

784
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,146
<15-51,CASTLE>回家  收拾东西  然后逃走了
<15-51,CASTLE>heads home, packs her things, hits the road.

785
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,528
<15-52,BECKETT>给词组"击跑配合战术"下了新的定义
<15-52,BECKETT>Giving a whole new meaning to the term "hit-and-run."

786
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:25,444
<16-1,BECKETT>贝克特  贝克特
<16-1,BECKETT>Beckett. B-e-c-k-e double-t.

787
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,570
<16-1,BECKETT>编号41319
<16-1,BECKETT>Badge 4-1-3-1-9.

788
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:29,089
<16-1,BECKETT>我需要交通安全管理局拦截
<16-1,BECKETT>I need a T.S.A. hold on

789
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,003
<16-1,BECKETT>一个可能潜逃的疑犯
<16-1,BECKETT>a potential fugitive.

790
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:31,759
<16-1,BECKETT>好  我不会挂
<16-1,BECKETT>Yes, I'll hold.

791
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,548
<16-2,ESPOSITO>同事在发布金塔纳那给的莱拉的照片
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Uniforms are circulating that picture of Lara we got from Quintana.

792
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:37,024
<16-2,ESPOSITO>张贴在她住处方圆1公里内
<16-2,ESPOSITO>They're plastering it on every storefront

793
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:37,949
<16-2,ESPOSITO>所有商店中
<16-2,ESPOSITO>within a mile of her place.

794
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,874
<16-3,MONTGOMERY>凶手是那个女孩吗
<16-3,MONTGOMERY>So it was the girl?

795
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:40,338
<16-4,BECKETT>证据都指向她
<16-4,BECKETT>Evidence looks that way.

796
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,045
<16-4,BECKETT>我们推测她用美人计使维加帮她离开古巴
<16-4,BECKETT>We figure she honey trapped Vega into giving her tickets out of Cuba,

797
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,450
<16-4,BECKETT>她到这里以后
<16-4,BECKETT>and when she got here,

798
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:45,527
<16-4,BECKETT>他想要的她不能给
<16-4,BECKETT>he wanted a little more than she was willing to give,

799
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:46,716
<16-4,BECKETT>祸起萧墙
<16-4,BECKETT>and things went south from there.

800
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,177
<16-5,CASTLE>也许从头到尾古巴政府也参与其中
<16-5,CASTLE>Maybe it was the Cuban government all along.

801
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,218
<16-5,CASTLE>他们憎恨维加的背叛
<16-5,CASTLE>They hated Vega for defecting.

802
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:53,473
<16-5,CASTLE>所以他们派出美女间谍让他坠入爱河
<16-5,CASTLE>So they send a beautiful spy for him to fall in love with.

803
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:56,156
<16-5,CASTLE>计划奏效了  他把她偷渡回家
<16-5,CASTLE>It works. He smuggles her back home,

804
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:59,776
<16-5,CASTLE>然后突然  他死了
<16-5,CASTLE>and bam! He's dead.

805
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,177
<16-6,MONTGOMERY>听起来好像卡塞尔写的小说
<16-6,MONTGOMERY>Sounds like a Castle story.

806
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:03,824
<16-7,CASTLE>我会起名为《最后的列车》[电影]
<16-7,CASTLE>I'll call it "Coraz de fuego."

807
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,444
<16-8,BECKETT>我需要拘留令
<16-8,BECKETT>Yes. I need a detain and contain.

808
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,939
<16-8,BECKETT>禁止飞行出境协议  谢谢
<16-8,BECKETT>All no-fly protocols. Thank you.

809
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:10,427
<16-9,CASTLE>我们真的应该监视领事馆
<16-9,CASTLE>Though we really should stake out the consulate.

810
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,199
<16-10,BECKETT>我们早想到了
<16-10,BECKETT>Way ahead of you.

811
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,260
<16-10,BECKETT>一小时前已经开始监视领事馆
<16-10,BECKETT>Surveillance has been there for about an hour.

812
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,202
<16-10,BECKETT>如果她不是出于自卫而杀死他
<16-10,BECKETT>If she killed him out of self-defense,

813
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,521
<16-10,BECKETT>她会回去找幕后黑手的
<16-10,BECKETT>then she'd go back to the devil she knows.

814
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:19,229
<16-11,CASTLE>我感觉到有人在怀疑我的推测
<16-11,CASTLE>And yet I'm sensing skepticism on my theory.

815
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,729
<16-11,CASTLE>-谢谢  -读心者
<16-11,CASTLE>- Yeah, thanks. - Mind reader.

816
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,571
<16-12,RYAN>你们俩都是天才
<16-12,RYAN>Well, you're both geniuses.

817
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:23,282
<16-12,RYAN>我们的人在领事馆
<16-12,RYAN>That was our guys at the consulate.

818
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:25,175
<16-12,RYAN>他们刚看见莱拉走进大门
<16-12,RYAN>They just spotted Lara walking right through the door.

819
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,091
<16-13,SANCHEZ>我无可奉告
<16-13,SANCHEZ>I don't know what to tell you.

820
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:28,918
<16-13,SANCHEZ>我从没见过这个女孩
<16-13,SANCHEZ>I've never seen that girl before.

821
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,007
<16-14,CASTLE>那你应该买视力矫正镜了
<16-14,CASTLE>Well,then you should invest in some corrective lenses.

822
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:34,272
<16-14,CASTLE>我们的人看见她进来  还不到半小时
<16-14,CASTLE>Our surveillance team saw her coming in here not half an hour ago.

823
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,135
<16-15,SANCHEZ>你们的人  你们现在在监视我们
<16-15,SANCHEZ>Surveillance team? You're watching us now?

824
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,768
<16-16,BECKETT>仅在法律允许的范围之内
<16-16,BECKETT>Only within the scope of the law.

825
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:41,214
<16-17,CASTLE>幕后看客成了被监视的人
<16-17,CASTLE>The watcher becomes the watched.

826
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,913
<16-17,CASTLE>我很喜欢用反讽  问她吧
<16-17,CASTLE>I'm a big fan of irony. Ask her.

827
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:46,639
<16-18,SANCHEZ>她是个要求庇护的古巴公民
<16-18,SANCHEZ>She's a Cuban citizen requesting asylum.

828
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,336
<16-19,BECKETT>她是谋杀案的嫌疑人
<16-19,BECKETT>She's a suspect in a murder investigation.

829
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:52,691
<16-20,SANCHEZ>你想让我把她交给美国政府吗
<16-20,SANCHEZ>And you expect me just to hand her over to the American authorities?

830
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:55,167
<16-21,BECKETT>桑切兹先生  我相信你很清楚
<16-21,BECKETT>Mr. Sanchez, as I'm sure you're well aware,

831
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:57,263
<16-21,BECKETT>一个国家的领事和大使馆
<16-21,BECKETT>a country's consulate and its embassy

832
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:59,623
<16-21,BECKETT>享有不同的权力
<16-21,BECKETT>have a different set of rights and privileges.

833
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,311
<16-21,BECKETT>这只是领事馆
<16-21,BECKETT>This is only a consulate.

834
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,444
<16-21,BECKETT>你并不享有外交豁免权
<16-21,BECKETT>You do not have diplomatic immunity.

835
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:08,505
<16-21,BECKETT>现在就交出那个姑娘
<16-21,BECKETT>Produce the girl now,

836
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:11,043
<16-21,BECKETT>否则我将取得搜查令  并向公众公开
<16-21,BECKETT>or I will get a search warrant and make a public spectacle

837
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:14,002
<16-21,BECKETT>贵国政府在美国国土私藏嫌犯
<16-21,BECKETT>of your government harboring a criminal on American soil.

838
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,943
<16-23,LARA>不  他不是我杀的
<16-23,LARA>No, I-I-I did not kill him. Please.

839
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,242
<16-24,BECKETT>-你们相信我  -那你为什么要逃跑
<16-24,BECKETT>- You have to believe. - Then why did you run?

840
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:42,001
<16-24,BECKETT>你为什么想回古巴
<16-24,BECKETT>Why did you try to go back to Cuba?

841
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,032
<16-25,LARA>我怕那个人也会杀我
<16-25,LARA>I was afraid the man will kill me, too.

842
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,670

<16-27,LARA>He come to... El piso.

844

845
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,033
<16-29,BECKETT>有个男人在维加遇害当晚
<16-29,BECKETT>There was a man who came to the apartment

846
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,219
<16-29,BECKETT>去了公寓  所以你才逃跑吗
<16-29,BECKETT>the night that Vega died, and that's why you were running?

847
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,331
<16-30,LARA>他杀害了我父亲
<16-30,LARA>He kill my father.

848
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,499
<16-31,CASTLE>你父亲
<16-31,CASTLE>Your father?

849
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:02,492
<16-32,LARA>维加
<16-32,LARA>Vega.

850
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:03,877
<16-33,CASTLE>卡尼奥·维加是你父亲
<16-33,CASTLE>Cano Vega is your father?

851
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,833
<16-34,BECKETT>莱拉  让我们从头开始
<16-34,BECKETT>O-okay, Lara, take us from the beginning.

852
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,179
<16-34,BECKETT>从头说起[西班牙语]
<16-34,BECKETT>Desde del principio.

853
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:10,140
<16-35,LARA>维加和我母亲...
<16-35,LARA>Vega and my mother...

854
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,260
<16-36,ESPOSITO>维加出逃前已经和她母亲订婚
<16-36,ESPOSITO>Vega and her mother were engaged when he defected.

855
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:27,090
<16-36,ESPOSITO>她本应该一起来的  但却没有
<16-36,ESPOSITO>She supposed to come, but she didn't.

856
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,128
<16-36,ESPOSITO>作为对维加叛逃的惩罚
<16-36,ESPOSITO>As punishment for what Vega did,

857
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:30,184
<16-36,ESPOSITO>他们把她母亲送进了监狱
<16-36,ESPOSITO>They threw her mother in prison.

858
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,961
<16-36,ESPOSITO>当时她母亲已经怀有身孕
<16-36,ESPOSITO>she was pregnant with her at the time.

859
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:35,606
<16-37,CASTLE>维加知道这事吗
<16-37,CASTLE>Did Vega know about this?

860
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,129
<16-38,ESPOSITO>直到两个月前
<16-38,ESPOSITO>Not until a couple of months ago

861
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,771
<16-38,ESPOSITO>他听说原来他有一个女儿
<16-38,ESPOSITO>when he heard a rumor that he had a daughter.

862
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,392
<16-39,CASTLE>维加就是为这事回古巴的
<16-39,CASTLE>Well, that's why vega went to Cuba.

863
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,183
<16-39,CASTLE>去证实他到底有没有女儿
<16-39,CASTLE>To see if he really did have a daughter.

864
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:50,983
<16-40,ESPOSITO>他们并没见着面
<16-40,ESPOSITO>They didn't actually meet

865
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,407
<16-40,ESPOSITO>因为古巴政府正监视着他
<16-40,ESPOSITO>Because the government was watching him.

866
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:55,569
<16-40,ESPOSITO>但他收到了她的信息
<16-40,ESPOSITO>But he got her a message

867
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,012
<16-40,ESPOSITO>让他尽快救她出去
<16-40,ESPOSITO>Saying that he would get her out as soon as he could.

868
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:03,366
<16-41,LARA>我第一次见我父亲是在三天前
<16-41,LARA>The first time I meet my father was... three nights ago,

869
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,400
<16-41,LARA>当时我就想告诉他
<16-41,LARA>And I want to tell him

870
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:08,513
<16-41,LARA>他一手酿成了多少痛苦
<16-41,LARA>How much suffering he caused.

871
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:14,864
<16-42,ESPOSITO>她从小到大一直认为
<16-42,ESPOSITO>She grew up believing

872
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,906
<16-42,ESPOSITO>他父亲为了富贵荣华而抛妻弃子
<16-42,ESPOSITO>That her father had abandoned her mother to get rich.

873
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,041
<16-42,ESPOSITO>但是他却告诉她  事实并非如此
<16-42,ESPOSITO>But he told her that that wasn't true...

874
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:21,448
<16-42,ESPOSITO>他之所以出走  只是因为
<16-42,ESPOSITO>That he only defected

875
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,229
<16-42,ESPOSITO>她母亲曾答应他一起远走高飞
<16-42,ESPOSITO>Because her mother said that she was going to as well.

876
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,298
<16-42,ESPOSITO>但她却在最后关头改变了主意
<16-42,ESPOSITO>But that she had changed her mind at the last minute.

877
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,565
<16-42,ESPOSITO>这些年来
<16-42,ESPOSITO>All these years,

878
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,221
<16-42,ESPOSITO>他一直以为她已经和自己恩断义绝
<16-42,ESPOSITO>He had thought that she had turned her back on him.

879
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,637
<16-42,ESPOSITO>但却没想到
<16-42,ESPOSITO>He never knew that they--

880
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:36,886
<16-42,ESPOSITO>政府利用他杀鸡儆猴
<16-42,ESPOSITO>That the government had made an example of him

881
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:38,109
<16-42,ESPOSITO>震慑其他球员
<16-42,ESPOSITO>To all the other players.

882
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:42,266
<16-42,ESPOSITO>他完全不知道她已死于狱中
<16-42,ESPOSITO>He never knew that she had died in prison.

883
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:43,890
<16-42,ESPOSITO>我父亲...
<16-42,ESPOSITO>My father...

884
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,211
<16-43,LARA>当他从我这里得知这些时  沮丧万分
<16-43,LARA>Is very upset when I tell him this.

885
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,175
<16-43,LARA>他说他需要和某个人谈谈
<16-43,LARA>He said he need to talk to someone.

886
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,663
<16-43,LARA>他给了我一些钱买吃的
<16-43,LARA>He, uh, uh, give me money for food.

887
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:52,904
<16-43,LARA>然后我就再也没见过他
<16-43,LARA>I never see him again.

888
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:57,321
<16-44,BECKETT>你之前说  曾有个男人出现在公寓
<16-44,BECKETT>You said earlier that there was a man at the apartment.

889
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,139
<16-45,LARA>当时我出去买吃的
<16-45,LARA>When I go to... The market to go buy food,

890
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:03,350
<16-45,LARA>等我回来的时候
<16-45,LARA>When I come back...

891
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,420
<16-45,LARA>我见到一个男人  出现在公寓
<16-45,LARA>I see a man at the, um, um, apartment,

892
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,110
<16-45,LARA>但并不是我父亲
<16-45,LARA>Not my father.

893
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,185
<16-45,LARA>我当时害怕极了  于是赶紧离开
<16-45,LARA>I was so scared, so I leave.

894
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:14,849
<16-45,LARA>后来我就听说卡尼奥·维加死了
<16-45,LARA>Then I hear Cano Vega is dead.

895
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,097
<16-45,LARA>于是我躲了起来
<16-45,LARA>So I run, and I hide.

896
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:20,530
<16-45,LARA>我只想回家
<16-45,LARA>I just wanted to go home.

897
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:23,385
<16-46,BECKETT>他杀了我父亲
<16-46,BECKETT>He killed my father.

898
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,033
<16-46,BECKETT>这个出现在你公寓的男子
<16-46,BECKETT>This man who came to your apartment...

899
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,165
<16-46,BECKETT>你能向我描述他的样子吗
<16-46,BECKETT>Can you describe him for me?

900
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:32,967
<16-47,LARA>可以
<16-47,LARA>Yes.

901
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:35,323
<16-48,FOX>咱们把话说清楚先
<16-48,FOX>Let--let me get this straight.

902
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,031
<16-48,FOX>一个非法偷渡客
<16-48,FOX>An illegal claiming to be

903
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:37,954
<16-48,FOX>声称自己是卡尼奥·维加的女儿
<16-48,FOX>Cano Vega's daughter,

904
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:40,577
<16-48,FOX>刚来到这个国家不到24小时
<16-48,FOX>After being in this country for less than 24 hours,

905
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,797
<16-48,FOX>就辨认出一个酷似我的人
<16-48,FOX>Identifies someone who kind of looks like me

906
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,750
<16-48,FOX>而且还是在晚上远距离看到的
<16-48,FOX>From a distance at night?

907
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,653
<16-48,FOX>有没有搞错  二位
<16-48,FOX>Well, gee, guys.

908
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,946
<16-48,FOX>怎么  难道我要现在就签字画押吗
<16-48,FOX>What, do I--what, do I sign my confession right now

909
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,171
<16-48,FOX>还是要先开个新闻发布会
<16-48,FOX>Or after the big, uh, press conference?

910
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,487
<16-49,CASTLE>现在就开吧
<16-49,CASTLE>Well, now's good.

911
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,484
<16-50,FOX>拜托  孩子们
<16-50,FOX>Come on, kids.

912
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:58,305
<16-50,FOX>拜托
<16-50,FOX>Come on.

913
00:35:58,581 --> 00:35:59,619
<16-50,FOX>你们知道他是我朋友
<16-50,FOX>You know he was my friend.

914
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,673
<16-50,FOX>更别提我们签了高额佣金
<16-50,FOX>Not to mention, a hefty commission.

915
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:02,630
<16-50,FOX>我动机何在
<16-50,FOX>What's my motive?

916
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,083
<16-51,BECKETT>福克斯先生  有钱人一旦出了问题
<16-51,BECKETT>The thing about people who have a lot, Mr. Fox,

917
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:06,617
<16-51,BECKETT>那一定不是小事
<16-51,BECKETT>Is that they have the most to lose.

918
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:08,612
<16-51,BECKETT>我相信维加得知真相时
<16-51,BECKETT>I'm sure vega felt betrayed

919
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:09,476
<16-51,BECKETT>觉得自己被出卖了
<16-51,BECKETT>when he learned the truth.

920
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,009
<16-52,FOX>真相  什么真相
<16-52,FOX>The truth? About what?

921
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:14,148
<16-52,FOX>那个你津津乐道的故事
<16-52,FOX>Your favorite story--

922
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:15,786
<16-53,CASTLE>1992年  巴塞罗那奥运会
<16-53,CASTLE>Barcelona, 1992.

923
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:16,939
<16-53,CASTLE>只是你跳过了那部分
<16-53,CASTLE>Only you left out the part

924
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,976
<16-53,CASTLE>关于你是如何谎称
<16-53,CASTLE>Where you lied to Cano Vega

925
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,670
<16-53,CASTLE>帮卡尼奥·维加的未婚妻逃走的
<16-53,CASTLE>About helping his fiance defect.

926
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:22,782
<16-54,FOX>她临时变卦  这又不是我的错
<16-54,FOX>It's not my fault that she changed her mind,

927
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,830
<16-55,CASTLE>实际上  你没办法带她离开
<16-55,CASTLE>Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island.

928
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,547
<16-55,CASTLE>同时  你也知道他宁愿留在那里陪她
<16-55,CASTLE>But you did know that he'd rather be there with her

929
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,599
<16-55,CASTLE>也不愿在大满贯赛里帮你赚个盆满钵满
<16-55,CASTLE>Than here making big bucks for you in the majors.

930
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,491
<16-56,BECKETT>于是你让他以为她变心了
<16-56,BECKETT>So you let him believe that she had changed her mind.

931
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:35,226
<16-56,BECKETT>同时为了确保他再也无从得知真相
<16-56,BECKETT>And to keep him from ever finding out the truth,

932
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,346
<16-56,BECKETT>你把她关了起来
<16-56,BECKETT>You had her put away.

933
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,284
<16-57,FOX>关起来  还是在古巴  拜托
<16-57,FOX>Put away? In Cuba? Oh, come on.

934
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,218
<16-57,FOX>我的确有很多门路
<16-57,FOX>I-I have a lot of pull,

935
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:45,772
<16-57,FOX>但是  要想在军事独裁国家说上话
<16-57,FOX>But, uh, influencing a military dictatorship

936
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,835
<16-57,FOX>并不像在马戏团餐厅[名店]订位那么容易
<16-57,FOX>Isn't as easy as getting a dinner reservation at le cirque.

937
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,368
<16-58,CASTLE>但你确实做到了
<16-58,CASTLE>You'd influenced their people before.

938
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,681
<16-58,CASTLE>玛纽埃·古铁兹  花名大章鱼
<16-58,CASTLE>Manuel gutierrez, A.K.A. El pulpo--

939
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:54,833
<16-58,CASTLE>那个大墨鱼
<16-58,CASTLE>The octopus.

940
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,803
<16-58,CASTLE>你带着古巴国家队的明星球员跑了
<16-58,CASTLE>You walked away with the star player

941
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,235
<16-58,CASTLE>而代价只是一块劳力士
<16-58,CASTLE>Of the cuban national team for a rolex.

942
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,886
<16-59,BECKETT>我们调查过了
<16-59,BECKETT>We did a little research.

943
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,215
<16-59,BECKETT>在她的审讯中  他是主要目击证人
<16-59,BECKETT>He was the chief witness at her trial.

944
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,860
<16-60,CASTLE>指控维加未婚妻
<16-60,CASTLE>Was denouncing Vega's fiance

945
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,538
<16-60,CASTLE>也是你和大章鱼计划的一部分吧
<16-60,CASTLE>Always a part of your plan with el pulpo

946
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:09,148
<16-60,CASTLE>还是你得为此额外付费
<16-60,CASTLE>Or did you have to pay extra for that?

947
00:37:09,148 --> 00:37:10,764
<16-60,CASTLE>我听说你很擅长和杀手讨价还价
<16-60,CASTLE>I've heard you're a killer negotiator.

948
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:14,275
<16-61,FOX>你们不会是认真的吧
<16-61,FOX>You can't possibly be serious.

949
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,491
<16-62,BECKETT>当维加发现了一切之后
<16-62,BECKETT>When vega figured out what you had done,

950
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:17,988
<16-62,BECKETT>他在俱乐部打电话给你约你见面
<16-62,BECKETT>He called you from his club and told you to meet him.

951
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,124
<16-62,BECKETT>我猜他跟踪了你并且威胁要毁了你
<16-62,BECKETT>I think he came after you and threatened to destroy you

952
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:22,490
<16-62,BECKETT>因此你杀了他
<16-62,BECKETT>And that's why you killed him.

953
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:24,540
<16-63,FOX>这故事太蹩脚了  孩子们
<16-63,FOX>It's a hell of a story, kids.

954
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,846
<16-63,FOX>我雇大章鱼害死我球员的女人
<16-63,FOX>I paid el pulpo to take care of my player's girl

955
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,698
<16-63,FOX>而且还是在古巴政府
<16-63,FOX>When the Cuban government

956
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:29,770
<16-63,FOX>眼皮底下顶风作案
<16-63,FOX>is sending away people every day?

957
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,427
<16-63,FOX>这算个什么说法
<16-63,FOX>That's a hell of a tale.

958
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,924
<16-63,FOX>这根本是在凭空臆断
<16-63,FOX>It's pure conjecture.

959
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:35,155
<16-64,BECKETT>你想要真凭实据吗
<16-64,BECKETT>You know what's not conjecture?

960
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,853
<16-64,BECKETT>我们在你的汽车驾驶座
<16-64,BECKETT>The blood that we found

961
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,607
<16-64,BECKETT>脚垫上发现了血迹
<16-64,BECKETT>On the driver's side floor mat in your car.

962
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,946
<16-64,BECKETT>属于维加
<16-64,BECKETT>That was vega's blood.

963
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,136
<16-65,CASTLE>尽管你小心清理过了
<16-65,CASTLE>As much as you tried to clean

964
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,351
<16-65,CASTLE>那双你谋杀维加时穿的
<16-65,CASTLE>Those $5,000 pair of shoes you were wearing

965
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:47,119
<16-65,CASTLE>价值五千大洋的鞋子
<16-65,CASTLE>While you smashed Vega's skull in,

966
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,291
<16-65,CASTLE>你还是没弄干净
<16-65,CASTLE>You didn't quite get all of it.

967
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,743
<16-66,FOX>辛西娅  通知我的律师
