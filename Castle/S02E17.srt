92
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,290

<3-2,CASTLE>What nefarious plots are you two hatching?

<3-8,MARTHA>但我可不想听你的冷嘲热讽
<3-8,MARTHA>But I am not in the mood for any of your cavalier quips.

116
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,600
<3-9,CASTLE>我会如临大敌般认真对待
<3-9,CASTLE>I'll be serious as a shark attack.

<3-12,MARTHA>为此  我列出了优劣势对比
<3-12,MARTHA>To that end, I have made a list of pros and cons.

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,990
<3-12,MARTHA>目前优势占上风
<3-12,MARTHA>So far the pros are winning.

<3-18,MARTHA>Who knows what bad habits Chet picked up

<3-20,CASTLE>The same way I have since the last man you lived with

131
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,760
<3-20,CASTLE>所有家产时一样
<3-20,CASTLE>stole your life savings.

132
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,360
<4-1,LANIE>死因是遭受多处枪伤
<4-1,LANIE>Cause of death is multiple gunshot wounds.

133
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,460
<4-1,LANIE>毒化检验显示  大概在死前一小时
<4-1,LANIE>Tox indicates he had a martini about an hour

134
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,560
<4-1,LANIE>他喝了一杯马提尼
<4-1,LANIE>before he died.

135
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,060
<4-1,LANIE>除此之外
<4-1,LANIE>Other than that,

136
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,760
<4-1,LANIE>尸体就没什么特别的了
<4-1,LANIE>there is nothing interesting about the body.

137
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
<4-2,BECKETT>那你为什么打电话给我
<4-2,BECKETT>So then why the call?

138
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,750
<4-3,LANIE>尸体没什么特别  麻烦让一下
<4-3,LANIE>The body isn't interesting. Excuse me.

139
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,480
<4-3,LANIE>但弹壳很奇特
<4-3,LANIE>But the bullets are.

140
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,320
<4-3,LANIE>看一下子弹底部的记号
<4-3,LANIE>Check out the marking on the end of the slugs.

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,790
<4-4,BECKETT>是配件工厂加的标记吗
<4-4,BECKETT>Aftermarket factory stamps?

142
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,130
<4-5,LANIE>不是
<4-5,LANIE>No.

143
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,020
<4-6,CASTLE>这些不是标记而是字母
<4-6,CASTLE>Those aren't stamps. They're letters.

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,850
<4-6,CASTLE>看  手工雕刻的
<4-6,CASTLE>And look, they're hand-etched.

145
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,130
<4-6,CASTLE>它们可以组成一个词
<4-6,CASTLE>They spell something.

146
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,800
<4-6,CASTLE>那个词是
<4-6,CASTLE>They spell...

147
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,730
<4-6,CASTLE>金妮
<4-6,CASTLE>"Kinki."

148
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,550
<4-6,CASTLE>不是
<4-6,CASTLE>No.

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,790
<4-6,CASTLE>是"妮基"
<4-6,CASTLE>"Nikki."

150
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,520
<4-7,BECKETT>妮基·希特
<4-7,BECKETT>Nikki Heat.

151
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,460
<4-7,BECKETT>所以他才给我打电话
<4-7,BECKETT>That's why he called me.

152
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
<4-7,BECKETT>还说是我的粉丝
<4-7,BECKETT>That's why he said he was a fan.

153
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,000
<4-7,BECKETT>谋杀是疯狂的献礼
<4-7,BECKETT>He dedicated this murder to me.

154
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,210
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>他知道妮基只是个虚构的人物吗
<5-1,MONTGOMERY>Does he realize she's a fictional character not a real person?

155
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,640
<5-2,CASTLE>显然他有妄想症  但考虑到妮基·希特
<5-2,CASTLE>Obviously, he's delusional, but given that Nikki Heat

156
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,950
<5-2,CASTLE>是以贝克特探长为原型
<5-2,CASTLE>is based on Detective Beckett,

157
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,110
<5-2,CASTLE>他可能把这两者搞混淆了
<5-2,CASTLE>maybe he's confusing the two.

158
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,910
<5-2,CASTLE>我们给亚历克斯·彼得曼的家人看了
<5-2,CASTLE>And we showed Alex Peterman's family

159
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,480
<5-2,CASTLE>嫌疑人的画像  他们不认识他
<5-2,CASTLE>the sketch of our suspect. He did not look familiar.

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,780
<5-3,MONTGOMERY>在取证上有什么进展
<5-3,MONTGOMERY>How are we on forensics?

161
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,880
<5-4,BECKETT>鉴证组已经采集了大约两百个指纹
<5-4,BECKETT>C.S.U. grabbed about 200 fingerprints,

162
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,960
<5-4,BECKETT>上千种纤维和60多份DNA样本
<5-4,BECKETT>a thousand fibers and 60 odd D.N.A. samples,

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,180
<5-4,BECKETT>这还只是在电话亭采集的
<5-4,BECKETT>And that was just from the phone box.

164
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,080
<5-4,BECKETT>他们会在处理完积压的工作后
<5-4,BECKETT>They're working them up now...

165
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,580
<5-4,BECKETT>着手进行化验
<5-4,BECKETT>after they clear their backlog.

166
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,020
<5-5,RYAN>贝克特  有人打电话找希特警探
<5-5,RYAN>Beckett. Guy on the phone's asking for Detective Heat.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,900
<5-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>妮基  你收到我的第一条信息了吗
<5-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>Nikki, did you get the first part of my message?

169
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,480
<5-8,BECKETT>是的  收到了
<5-8,BECKETT>Yes, I did.

170
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,950
<5-9,MAN>第二条在中央公园的旋转木马那里
<5-9,MAN>Well, the second is at the Central Park carousel.

171
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,290
<6-1,LANIE>她被点45口径手枪射中4枪
<6-1,LANIE>She was shot 4 times with a .45.

172
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,960
<6-1,LANIE>死者身体左侧的挫伤
<6-1,LANIE>There are contusions on the victim's left side

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,960
<6-1,LANIE>和点45口径枪口形状吻合
<6-1,LANIE>consistent with the muzzle of a .45

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
<6-1,LANIE>是枪口卡在肋骨间所致
<6-1,LANIE>being jammed into her ribs.

175
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,800
<6-1,LANIE>我猜凶手是左撇子
<6-1,LANIE>I'm guessing the killer is left-handed.

176
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,180
<6-2,BECKETT>子弹是鉴证组从马车背面拔出来的吗
<6-2,BECKETT>C.S.U. pull the slugs from the back of the carriage?

177
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
<6-3,LANIE>是的  子弹上有字母
<6-3,LANIE>Yes, there were letters on the slugs.

178
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,810
<6-3,LANIE>写的是"将"
<6-3,LANIE>They spell "W-I-L-L."

179
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,910
<6-4,BECKETT>所以他是在传达信息
<6-4,BECKETT>So he's sending a message.

180
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,140
<6-5,CASTLE>妮基将...
<6-5,CASTLE>"Nikki will"...

181
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,850
<6-5,CASTLE>什么呢  妮基将怎么样
<6-5,CASTLE>What? Nikki will what?

182
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,560
<6-6,BECKETT>谢谢  蕾妮
<6-6,BECKETT>Thank you, Lanie.

183
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,280
<6-8,CASTLE>这家伙是个职业级的连环杀手
<6-8,CASTLE>I guess it's official. Our guy is a serial killer.

184
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,810
<6-9,BECKETT>一个连环杀手
<6-9,BECKETT>I would think that a serial killer

185
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,040
<6-9,BECKETT>对于犯罪小说家来说
<6-9,BECKETT>would be like the holy grail

186
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,020
<6-9,BECKETT>-就像圣杯一样可贵  -可能是吧
<6-9,BECKETT>- for a crime novelist.  - I guess it would be

187
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,890
<6-10,CASTLE>如果不是和妮基·希特有关就好了
<6-10,CASTLE>or if it weren't for the Nikki Heat at all.

188
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,820
<6-12,CASTLE>我觉得我该负部分责任
<6-12,CASTLE>I'm feeling a little bit responsible.

189
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,030
<6-13,BECKETT>是吗  那么因为《匆匆太匆匆》这首歌
<6-13,BECKETT>Really? Like the Beatles are responsible

190
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,460
<6-13,BECKETT>披头士乐队就该为杀人狂查理·曼森负责吗
<6-13,BECKETT>for Charles Manson 'cause of "Helter skelter"?

192
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,300
<6-13,BECKETT>还是说  朱迪·福斯特要为
<6-13,BECKETT>Or is it more like Jodie Foster is responsible

194
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,890
<6-13,BECKETT>约翰·欣克利刺杀里根总统而负责
<6-13,BECKETT>for John Hinckley shooting Reagan?

195
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,080
<6-14,CASTLE>如果我没有塑造妮基·希特这个角色
<6-14,CASTLE>If I hadn't created Nikki Heat--

196
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,770
<6-15,BECKETT>他还是会杀人
<6-15,BECKETT>He would still be killing.

197
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,540
<6-15,BECKETT>只是他会找别的理由
<6-15,BECKETT>He'd just find another reason why.

198
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,600
<6-16,MAN>好了  各位  请让一下
<6-16,MAN>All right, folks. Make way.

199
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,840
<6-17,WOMAN>出什么事了
<6-17,WOMAN>Now what's going on?

200
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,270
<6-18,CASTLE>如果不是刚刚有飞碟在公园那头降落
<6-18,CASTLE>Either a U.F.O. just landed on the other side of the park...

201
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,690
<6-19,BECKETT>就是联邦调查局来插手这件案子了
<6-19,BECKETT>Or else the FBI is here to claim jurisdiction over this case.

202
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,380
<6-20,CASTLE>可能他们只是想在队伍还没排成长龙前
<6-20,CASTLE>Maybe they just want to ride on the carousel

203
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,760
<6-20,CASTLE>骑下旋转木马
<6-20,CASTLE>before the line gets too long.

204
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,330
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>以旋转木马为中心围成方圆三米的警戒区
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>Rope off a 10-foot circumference around the carousel.

205
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,910
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>采集指纹  查找证据
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>Sweep for prints and trace evidence.

206
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,950
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>关闭公园的六号入口
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>Close off the park entrance at 6th.

207
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,110
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>检查所有人行道
<6-21,AGENT JORDAN SHAW>Work up the entire footpath.

208
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,530
<6-23,BECKETT>开始了
<6-23,BECKETT>Here goes.

209
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,870
<6-24,SHAW>我猜你就是妮基·希特吧
<6-24,SHAW>Nikki Heat I presume.

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,190
<6-25,BECKETT>我是贝克特  凯特·贝克特探长
<6-25,BECKETT>It's Beckett. Detective Kate Beckett.

211
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,040
<6-26,SHAW>我看过《时尚》杂志中你的报道  久仰了
<6-26,SHAW>Yeah, I read all about you in "Cosmo."

212
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,600
<6-26,SHAW>那你肯定就是著名的作家以及跟班
<6-26,SHAW>And you must be the celebrity writer tagalong,

213
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,860
<6-26,SHAW>理查德·卡塞尔
<6-26,SHAW>Richard Castle.

214
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,860
<6-27,CASTLE>-我是特工乔丹·肖  -乔丹·肖
<6-27,CASTLE>- Special agent Jordan Shaw.  - Jor-Jordan Shaw?

215
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,510
<6-27,CASTLE>是1991年侦破
<6-27,CASTLE>The same Jordan Shaw that broke

216
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,150
<6-27,CASTLE>哈得逊河谷杀人案的那个乔丹·肖吗
<6-27,CASTLE>the Hudson Valley strangler case back in 1991?

217
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,300
<6-28,SHAW>我的拼字游戏也玩的不错[也有擅长摸索之意]
<6-28,SHAW>I also play a mean game of scrabble.

218
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,040
<6-28,SHAW>既然我们互相都认识了  我想看看尸体
<6-28,SHAW>Now that we all know each other, I'd like to see the body.

219
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,220
<6-29,BECKETT>特工肖  我的手下已经封锁了这片区域
<6-29,BECKETT>Agent Shaw, my people have already secured the area.

220
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,850
<6-29,BECKETT>鉴定组在现场取证
<6-29,BECKETT>C.S.U. is on the scene,

221
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,610
<6-29,BECKETT>警员也在公园内收集证词
<6-29,BECKETT>and we are canvassing the park.

222
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,540
<6-29,BECKETT>我很高兴看到这些装甲兵
<6-29,BECKETT>So as happy as I am to see the cavalry,

223
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,700
<6-29,BECKETT>但这里实在不需要你们
<6-29,BECKETT>there's really not much left here for you to do.

224
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,710
<6-30,SHAW>探长  是上面的头儿
<6-30,SHAW>Detective, the Gods in the marble halls

225
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,820
<6-30,SHAW>派我来缉拿凶手的  不管有没有你的帮助
<6-30,SHAW>have sent me here to catch a killer, which I will do

226
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,560
<6-30,SHAW>这都是我要完成的任务  懂了吗
<6-30,SHAW>with or without your help, okay?

227
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,290
<6-30,SHAW>现在我能看尸体了吗
<6-30,SHAW>Now could I see the body?

228
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,760
<6-31,CASTLE>这真应该拍进电影里
<6-31,CASTLE>That is so going in the movie.

229
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,640
<6-31,CASTLE>你能再说一遍吗
<6-31,CASTLE>Can you say that again,

230
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,400
<6-31,CASTLE>从"上面的头儿"那里开始
<6-31,CASTLE>but start from "marble halls"?

231
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,780
<6-32,RYAN>警员在垃圾桶里找到了这个钱包
<6-32,RYAN>Unis pulled this from a trash bin. Wallet's inside.

232
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,180
<6-32,RYAN>死者名叫米歇尔·刘易斯
<6-32,RYAN>The vic's name is Michelle Lewis.

233
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,350
<6-33,ESPOSITO>从名片来看  她是个职业遛狗人
<6-33,ESPOSITO>According to her business card, she's a dog walker.

234
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,770
<6-34,BECKETT>这里有个指纹
<6-34,BECKETT>There's a print here,

235
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,550
<6-34,BECKETT>但比死者的指纹大
<6-34,BECKETT>And it's too large to be our victim's.

236
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,090
<6-34,BECKETT>拿去化验室吧
<6-34,BECKETT>Let's get it to the lab for--

237
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
<6-35,BECKETT>你在做什么
<6-35,BECKETT>What are you doing?

238
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,030
<6-36,SHAW>指纹已经传到化验室进行检测了
<6-36,SHAW>That print is already in the lab and being processed.

239
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,800
<6-36,SHAW>操作简单  轻巧易携带
<6-36,SHAW>No muss, no fuss, no black powder on your clothes.

240
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,270
<6-37,CASTLE>居然有如此神奇的装备
<6-37,CASTLE>Wow. There's an app for that?

241
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,810
<6-38,SHAW>这是我加入联调局的动力
<6-38,SHAW>That's why I joined the FBI,

242
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,480
<6-38,SHAW>卡塞尔先生  装备一流
<6-38,SHAW>Mr. Castle, for the toys.

243
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,400
<6-38,SHAW>我迫不及待想看看尸体了
<6-38,SHAW>I'm really eager to see that body.

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,540
<6-39,CASTLE>我能看看那...
<6-39,CASTLE>Can I take a look at that--

245
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,980
<6-40,CASTLE>以后有机会再看吧
<6-40,CASTLE>Be a chance to check it later.

246
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,420
<7-1,CASTLE>怎么回事
<7-1,CASTLE>What is going on?

247
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,320
<7-2,BECKETT>他们在搭建作战室
<7-2,BECKETT>They're setting up the war room.

248
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,540
<7-3,CASTLE>作战室
<7-3,CASTLE>War room?

249
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,120
<7-4,BECKETT>把你知道的乔丹·肖的一切都告诉我
<7-4,BECKETT>Tell me everything you know about Jordan Shaw.

250
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,460
<7-5,CASTLE>她就像是联调局版本的你
<7-5,CASTLE>She is like the Federal you.

251
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,800
<7-5,CASTLE>她很出色  相当的出色
<7-5,CASTLE>She is good. She is real good.

252
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,800
<7-5,CASTLE>她在二十五岁那年侦破了
<7-5,CASTLE>She cracked open that Hudson Valley strangler case

253
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,300
<7-5,CASTLE>哈得逊河谷杀人案
<7-5,CASTLE>when she was just 25.

254
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,950
<7-6,BECKETT>我听说他们凭一张超速罚单逮住了他
<7-6,BECKETT>I thought they caught him off of a speeding ticket.

255
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,930
<7-7,CASTLE>别问我他怎么被逮住的
<7-7,CASTLE>Well, don't ask me how,

256
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,140
<7-7,CASTLE>但她分析出凶手开的是越野车
<7-7,CASTLE>but she profiled that he drove a Yugo.

257
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,080
<7-8,BECKETT>他被捕时  车后座绑着一个女孩
<7-8,BECKETT>They found a girl tied up in the back.

258
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,070
<7-9,CASTLE>乔丹·肖救了那女孩的命
<7-9,CASTLE>Uh-huh. Jordan Shaw saved that girl's life.

259
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,310
<7-10,BECKETT>以前也没见你看见谁这么兴奋
<7-10,BECKETT>I've never seen you so excited to meet anyone before.

260
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,050
<7-11,CASTLE>没有  我只是  我很佩服...
<7-11,CASTLE>No, I just--I'm-- Oh, I'm impressed with--

261
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,480
<7-12,MAN>借过  当心
<7-12,MAN>Excuse us. Watch it.

262
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,560
<7-12,MAN>我们现在能去作战室看看吗
<7-12,MAN>Can we go see the war room now?

263
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,030
<8-1,SHAW>你也在搜索匹配指纹吗
<8-1,SHAW>You're running partials, too, right?

264
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,570
<8-2,AVERY>正在检索整个数据库
<8-2,AVERY>Through all databases.

265
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,060
<8-2,AVERY>化验室会以最快速度反馈我们跟进的资料
<8-2,AVERY>The lab's getting us information as fast as we can follow up.

266
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,880
<8-3,BECKETT>不是说鉴证组积压的活儿堆积如山吗
<8-3,BECKETT>I thought there was a backlog at the lab.

267
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,550
<8-4,SHAW>我有联邦加急令  所以可以优先
<8-4,SHAW>I have a federal fast pass, so I get to jump the line.

268
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,680
<8-5,SHAW>目前  我们从两个案发现场得到的
<8-5,SHAW>Currently we are running 35 solid leads

269
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,840
<8-5,SHAW>DNA  指纹
<8-5,SHAW>based on DNA., prints,

270
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,840
<8-5,SHAW>及蛛丝马迹中  掌握了35条可靠的线索
<8-5,SHAW>trace evidence found from both crime scenes,

271
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,020
<8-5,SHAW>联调局的二维码处理软件正分析这些线索
<8-5,SHAW>and we're running it through the FBI data matrix.

272
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,840
<8-5,SHAW>以此来找出受害人之间的联系
<8-5,SHAW>The matrix also looks for a connection between the victims

273
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,520
<8-5,SHAW>以防凶手在固定区域以固定手法
<8-5,SHAW>in case the killer has a type or a favorite hunting ground

274
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,150
<8-5,SHAW>有计划性地行凶
<8-5,SHAW>or isn't killing randomly.

275
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,860
<8-6,CASTLE>亚历克斯·彼得曼  米歇尔·刘易斯
<8-6,CASTLE>Both Alex Peterman and Michelle Lewis belonged to

276
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,240
<8-6,CASTLE>同是威克斯健身房的会员  但区域不同
<8-6,CASTLE>the same Wessex gym, but they went to different locations.

277
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,760
<8-6,CASTLE>他们都是现代艺术博物馆的会员
<8-6,CASTLE>They were both members of MoMA.

278
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,340
<8-6,CASTLE>他们的狗是在同一家动物防虐协会领养的
<8-6,CASTLE>Hmm. They both adopted their dogs from the same ASPCA.

279
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,600
<8-7,BECKETT>听起来它为你做了本该你做的活儿
<8-7,BECKETT>Sounds like it does your job for you.

280
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,600
<8-8,SHAW>机器能收集信息  但它不能思考
<8-8,SHAW>A machine can collate. It can't think.

281
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,370
<8-8,SHAW>得用心去理解罪犯的心理
<8-8,SHAW>It takes a mind to hunt a mind.

282
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
<8-8,SHAW>分析下这家伙吧
<8-8,SHAW>Take this guy.

283
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,110
<8-10,SHAW>他主动报警  检举自己的犯罪行为
<8-10,SHAW>He calls the police to report his own crime,

284
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,250
<8-10,SHAW>喜欢在人口密集的地区杀人
<8-10,SHAW>likes to kill in heavily populated areas

285
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,150
<8-10,SHAW>然后用弹壳传递信息
<8-10,SHAW>and uses bullets as messages.

286
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,060
<8-10,SHAW>这种嚣张的怪胎  通常是智力有问题
<8-10,SHAW>Now most of these stalker types can barely tie their own shoes.

287
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,850
<8-10,SHAW>但他与众不同  相当聪明
<8-10,SHAW>This one's different, smarter.

288
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,260
<8-11,BECKETT>听你的语气似乎是欣赏他
<8-11,BECKETT>You almost sound like you admire him.

289
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,730
<8-12,SHAW>我对他的欣赏
<8-12,SHAW>I admire him the way

290
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,660
<8-12,SHAW>如同电影《大白鲨》中罗伯特·肖对鲨鱼的欣赏一样
<8-12,SHAW>Robert Shaw admired the shark in "Jaws."

291
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,360
<8-12,SHAW>我越了解他
<8-12,SHAW>The better I know him,

292
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,520
<8-12,SHAW>就越容易逮住他
<8-12,SHAW>the easier it'll be to catch him.

293
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,990
<8-13,CASTLE>就像我写作的时候一样
<8-13,CASTLE>That's like when I'm writing.

294
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,430
<8-13,CASTLE>凶手的声音是伪造的
<8-13,CASTLE>The killer's voice doesn't sound authentic

295
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,170
<8-13,CASTLE>但我并不知道他的动机
<8-13,CASTLE>unless I understand his motivation.

296
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,630
<8-14,SHAW>这家伙想引人注目
<8-14,SHAW>Well, this guy likes to make a scene.

297
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,990
<8-14,SHAW>就算他是纵火犯  我也不吃惊
<8-14,SHAW>I wouldn't be surprised if he was also an arsonist.

298
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,780
<8-14,SHAW>我想妮基·希特这个角色
<8-14,SHAW>In fact, I think that's what drew him

299
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,320
<8-14,SHAW>最初吸引他的是
<8-14,SHAW>to the Nikki Heat character in the first place --

300
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,350
<8-14,SHAW>"热浪"这个名字
<8-14,SHAW>her name.

301
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,340
<8-14,SHAW>说到"热浪"探长
<8-14,SHAW>Speaking of Detective Heat...

302
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,640
<8-15,CASTLE>大伙  听着
<8-15,CASTLE>Whoa. Whoa. Guys. Listen.

303
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
<8-15,CASTLE>不是我不喜欢版税  但
<8-15,CASTLE>Not that I don't appreciate the royalties, but, uh,

304
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,520
<8-15,CASTLE>你们要一百本《希特热浪》做什么
<8-15,CASTLE>why do you need a hundred copies of "Heat Wave"?

305
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,620
<8-16,SHAW>如果凶手为妮基·希特着迷
<8-16,SHAW>If our killer is obsessed with Nikki Heat,

306
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,690
<8-16,SHAW>我们也得这么做
<8-16,SHAW>then so are we.

307
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,480
<8-16,SHAW>艾弗里  请念概要
<8-16,SHAW>Avery, cliff notes, please.

308
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,710
<8-17,AVERY>一个地产大亨遇害
<8-17,AVERY>A real estate tycoon is killed.

309
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,080
<8-17,AVERY>妮基·希特警探负责此案
<8-17,AVERY>Detective Nikki Heat catches the case

310
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,520
<8-17,AVERY>并根据杀人动机调查嫌疑人
<8-17,AVERY>and investigates suspects who wanted the man dead.

311
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,890
<8-17,AVERY>其中当然包括他的娇妻
<8-17,AVERY>There's a trophy wife, of course,

312
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,980
<8-17,AVERY>还有危险的犯罪团伙
<8-17,AVERY>dangerous mobsters---

313
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,890
<8-18,CASTLE>对不起  打断一下
<8-18,CASTLE>Uh, uh, excuse me.

314
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,420
<8-18,CASTLE>这本可是《纽约时报》榜上的畅销书啊
<8-18,CASTLE>It's--It's a--It's a "New York times" best-seller.

315
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,870
<8-18,CASTLE>没必要像念经一样
<8-18,CASTLE>I don't think there's a need

316
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,490
<8-18,CASTLE>读的干巴巴的
<8-18,CASTLE>to make it sound quite so dry.

317
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,030
<8-18,CASTLE>谢了
<8-18,CASTLE>Thanks.

318
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,920
<8-19,AVERY>希特的生活
<8-19,AVERY>Heat's life is complicated by

319
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,230
<8-19,AVERY>因记者詹姆森·洛克而复杂起来
<8-19,AVERY>a reporter named Jameson Rook,

320
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,230
<8-19,AVERY>他为了写作整天跟着她转
<8-19,AVERY>who's following her around for an article he's writing.

321
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,950
<8-19,AVERY>希特和洛克常常斗嘴
<8-19,AVERY>Heat and Rook verbally spar,

322
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,840
<8-19,AVERY>在第十一章
<8-19,AVERY>and in chapter 11,

323
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,040
<8-19,AVERY>终于承认彼此吸引  然后做爱
<8-19,AVERY>admit their attraction for one another and have sex.

324
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,120
<8-21,BECKETT>这是小说
<8-21,BECKETT>It's fiction.

325
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,340
<8-22,AVERY>最后真相大白
<8-22,AVERY>In the end, when the killer's revealed,

326
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,270
<8-22,AVERY>凶手其实就是
<8-22,AVERY>it turns out it's actually--

327
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,140
<8-23,CASTLE>等等  别剧透哦
<8-23,CASTLE>Oh, oh, oh. Spoiler alert.

328
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,600
<8-24,SHAW>鉴于卡塞尔先生有着艺术家的敏感性
<8-24,SHAW>In deference to Mr. Castle's artistic sensitivity,

329
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,030
<8-24,SHAW>大家还是在书中找出凶手的身份吧
<8-24,SHAW>you can all read the book to find out the identity of the killer.

330
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,270
<8-24,SHAW>谢谢

<8-26,AVERY>That pinkie print off the second victim's purse

336
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,210
<8-26,AVERY>属于名叫唐纳德·索尔特的人  曾两次入狱
<8-26,AVERY>belongs to a Donald Salt, 2-time loser,

<8-26,AVERY>和你们从中央车站采集的
<8-26,AVERY>They just matched it to the partial pinkie print

339
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,130
<8-26,AVERY>部分小指指纹也吻合
<8-26,AVERY>your team recovered from grand central.

340
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,310
<8-27,CASTLE>两个小指指纹
<8-27,CASTLE>Two pinkie prints?

341
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,160
<8-27,CASTLE>那么说他去过车站和旋转木马
<8-27,CASTLE>So he was at the station and the carousel.

342
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,110
<8-28,BECKETT>钱包把他和死者联系了起来
<8-28,BECKETT>And the purse puts him with our victim.

343
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,690
<8-29,SHAW>行动吧
<8-29,SHAW>Let's mount up.

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
<9-1,SHAW>好的  刚停车
<9-1,SHAW>Yeah. Okay. Just pulling up now.

345
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,150
<9-1,SHAW>是的  明白
<9-1,SHAW>Yep, got it.

346
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,240
<9-1,SHAW>索尔特住在那栋砖房里
<9-1,SHAW>Salt lives in that brick building.

347
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,020
<9-1,SHAW>他的假释监管说他一小时前下班了
<9-1,SHAW>His supervisor says he left work an hour ago.

348
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,320
<9-1,SHAW>他现在应该在家
<9-1,SHAW>So he should be home by now.

349
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,090
<9-1,SHAW>等增援一来  立马逮捕他
<9-1,SHAW>When the others get here, we'll take him.

350
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,530
<9-2,SHAW>他在做什么
<9-2,SHAW>What is he doing?

351
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,220
<9-3,BECKETT>他啊  满足自己的好奇心呗
<9-3,BECKETT>He, um, touches things.

352
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,240
<9-4,CASTLE>夜视镜
<9-4,CASTLE>Night vision goggles.

353
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,110
<9-4,CASTLE>我想我的那个型号更先进些
<9-4,CASTLE>I think I have the newer model though.

354
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,810
<9-4,CASTLE>也许《希特热浪》第三部里
<9-4,CASTLE>You know, maybe in my third book,

355
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,080
<9-4,CASTLE>妮基·希特会和联调局的
<9-4,CASTLE>Nikki Heat will cross swords

356
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,480
<9-4,CASTLE>冷美人分析专家正面交锋
<9-4,CASTLE>with a good-looking, yet coldhearted FBI profiler.

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,910
<9-4,CASTLE>书名是《希特在联调局》
<9-4,CASTLE>Call it "Federal Heat."

358
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
<9-4,CASTLE>当我没说
<9-4,CASTLE>Or maybe not.

359
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,790
<9-5,SHAW>你们俩的性关系维持多久了
<9-5,SHAW>So how long have you two been sleeping together?

360
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,990
<9-6,BECKETT>我  我们没有性关系
<9-6,BECKETT>I'm... We're-- We're not sleeping together.

361
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,620
<9-7,BECKETT>他只是在观察我
<9-7,BECKETT>We--He-- He just observes me.

362
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,850
<9-8,SHAW>我看出他用什么眼神观察了
<9-8,SHAW>Yeah. I've seen how he observes you.

363
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,020
<9-9,CASTLE>她说的是事实  撇开我的第二任妻子不谈
<9-9,CASTLE>No, she's right. Aside from my second wife,

364
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,460
<9-9,CASTLE>这是我经历过的
<9-9,CASTLE>this is the most sexless relationship

365
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,580
<9-9,CASTLE>最无性的关系
<9-9,CASTLE>I've ever been in.

366
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,680
<9-10,SHAW>对于人  我观察分析有些日子了
<9-10,SHAW>I've been profiling people for a long time.

367
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,850
<9-10,SHAW>我很少看错的
<9-10,SHAW>I'm hardly ever wrong.

368
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,380
<9-11,BECKETT>这次你错了
<9-11,BECKETT>Well, this time you are... wrong.

369
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,170
<9-12,SHAW>如果你们没有性关系
<9-12,SHAW>So if you're not sleeping together,

370
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,420
<9-12,SHAW>你为什么让他围着你转
<9-12,SHAW>why do you keep him around?

371
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,090
<9-13,CASTLE>别当我是聋子
<9-13,CASTLE>You know I can hear you?

372
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,790
<9-14,BECKETT>事实上  他出人意料的有用
<9-14,BECKETT>He's actually proven to be surprisingly helpful.

373
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,530
<9-15,SHAW>我也只能相信你了
<9-15,SHAW>Hmm. Have to take your word on that.

374
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,230
<9-16,SHAW>把电击枪放下
<9-16,SHAW>Put the taser down.

375
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,900
<9-17,SHAW>小组到了
<9-17,SHAW>Okay, the team's here.

376
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,810
<9-17,SHAW>你待在车里
<9-17,SHAW>You stay in the car.

377
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,630
<9-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她说了  待在车里
<9-18,BECKETT>You heard her, Castle. Stay.

378
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,110
<9-19,CASTLE>至少帮我打开窗户吧
<9-19,CASTLE>Could you at least crack the window for me?

379
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,370
<9-20,MAN>跟上  我们走  快点
<9-20,MAN>Come on. Let's go. Move, move.

380
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,030
<9-21,SHAW>速战速决  避免伤亡
<9-21,SHAW>Let's make it quick and bloodless.

381
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,430
<9-22,MAN>上  上  上
<9-22,MAN>Go, go, go.

382
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,320
<9-23,SHAW>等等
<9-23,SHAW>Hang on.

383
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,460
<9-23,SHAW>站住  联邦调查局
<9-23,SHAW>Stop! FBI! Hey!

384
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,760
<9-25,CASTLE>看吧  我帮上忙了
<9-25,CASTLE>See, I'm helping.

385
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,410
<9-26,SHAW>乖  待会儿给你买个冰淇淋
<9-26,SHAW>Yeah. I'll buy you an ice cream later.

386
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,000
<9-27,BECKETT>特工肖  情况不妙
<9-27,BECKETT>Agent Shaw, we got a problem.

387
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,970
<9-27,BECKETT>他的小指断了
<9-27,BECKETT>His pinkie finger's missing.

388
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,010
<9-28,SALT>谁是妮基·希特
<9-28,SALT>Which one of you is Nikki Heat?

389
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,810
<10-1,SALT>那天我上交易网站
<10-1,SALT>So I was on one of those internet barter sites,

390
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,040
<10-1,SALT>想找
<10-1,SALT>and I was looking--

391
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
<10-1,SALT>我想找什么并不重要
<10-1,SALT>It, uh, doesn't matter what I was looking for.

392
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,750
<10-1,SALT>重要的是我看见一则广告
<10-1,SALT>But I came across the ad.

393
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,520
<10-1,SALT>高价收购手指
<10-1,SALT>"Finger wanted. Will pay top dollar."

394
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,650
<10-2,BECKETT>一个小指出价多少
<10-2,BECKETT>And what's top dollar for a pinkie finger?

395
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:19,090
<10-3,SALT>五千美元
<10-3,SALT>5,000 bucks.

396
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,360
<10-4,SHAW>听起来跟真的似的
<10-4,SHAW>Sounds like a real deal.

397
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,520
<10-5,SALT>卖个肾也没那么多钱
<10-5,SALT>Hey, you get less than that for a kidney.

398
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,530
<10-5,SALT>所以我给他回了邮件
<10-5,SALT>So anyway, I e-mailed him back.

399
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,030
<10-5,SALT>告诉他  他想要的我都能给
<10-5,SALT>I told him I had everything he wanted.

400
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,260
<10-6,SHAW>然后你就把手指给他了
<10-6,SHAW>You gave him the finger.

401
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,630
<10-6,SHAW>他还有什么要求
<10-6,SHAW>What more did he want?

402
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,260
<10-7,SALT>他要求我有暴力犯罪的案底
<10-7,SALT>He wanted me to have a violent felony conviction

403
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,690
<10-7,SALT>并且最近刚刚获得假释
<10-7,SALT>and to be recently paroled.

404
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,650
<10-7,SALT>还要求我心甘情愿地经受一次
<10-7,SALT>And you also had to be willing to suffer through

405
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,730
<10-7,SALT>不体面的错误逮捕
<10-7,SALT>the indignity of a false arrest.

406
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,690
<10-7,SALT>他告诉我妮基·希特警探会来抓我
<10-7,SALT>He told me Detective Nikki Heat would be coming for me.

407
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,030
<10-7,SALT>可能还会有身体接触
<10-7,SALT>And it might get physical.

408
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,850
<10-7,SALT>但他没提到"美国上尉"[漫画书中的英雄人物]
<10-7,SALT>He didn't mention anything about Captain America

409
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,320
<10-7,SALT>和他的电击枪
<10-7,SALT>with the taser gun.

410
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,500
<10-8,BECKETT>他警告过你
<10-8,BECKETT>So he warned you

411
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,150
<10-8,BECKETT>他会把你的指纹印在凶案现场
<10-8,BECKETT>that he would be planting your print at a murder scene.

412
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,160
<10-9,SHAW>所以你才会有不在场证据
<10-9,SHAW>Which is why you have an alibi.

413
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,980
<10-10,SALT>我每晚都坐在麦克索利酒吧
<10-10,SALT>I was perched on my favorite bar stool

414
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,250
<10-10,SALT>我最喜欢的座位上  直到打烊
<10-10,SALT>at Mcsorley's until closing every night

415
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,220
<10-10,SALT>从那个人把我的手指装进
<10-10,SALT>since that man took my digit

416
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,160
<10-10,SALT>冷却器带走的那晚开始
<10-10,SALT>and walked away with it in his cooler.

417
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
<10-11,SHAW>是这个男人吗
<10-11,SHAW>Is this the man?

418
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,790
<10-12,SALT>不能肯定  我没见到他的真面目
<10-12,SALT>I'm not sure. I didn't really see him.

419
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,080
<10-12,SALT>他带着帽子和太阳镜
<10-12,SALT>He had a hat and sunglasses.

420
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,460
<10-13,BECKETT>你的手指是谁包扎的
<10-13,BECKETT>Who bandaged your finger?

421
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,470
<10-14,SALT>是他
<10-14,SALT>He did.

422
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,630
<10-14,SALT>他还说你会注意到的
<10-14,SALT>He said you'd notice.

423
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,120
<10-15,SALT>温柔点  妮基
<10-15,SALT>Ooh, be gentle with me, Nikki.

424
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,570
<10-16,BECKETT>这里有数字
<10-16,BECKETT>There's numbers here.

425
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,960
<10-16,BECKETT>看起来像组密码
<10-16,BECKETT>This looks like a code.

426
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,880
<11-1,CASTLE>断指
<11-1,CASTLE>Severed digits,

427
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,680
<11-1,CASTLE>和密码  很像我书里的内容
<11-1,CASTLE>a secret code--This is like one of my books.

428
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,220
<11-2,SHAW>你真应该和我一起侦查那起易头案
<11-2,SHAW>You should've been with me on the recapitator case.

429
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,380
<11-3,CASTLE>是凤凰城那起凶手调换死者头部的案子吗
<11-3,CASTLE>What, that guy in Phoenix who switched his victims' heads?

430
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,910
<11-3,CASTLE>那居然是你负责的案子
<11-3,CASTLE>That was your case?

431
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,950
<11-4,AVERY>技术人员把这些数字
<11-4,AVERY>Our techs have run the numbers

432
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,460
<11-4,AVERY>进行了所有的常规密码分析
<11-4,AVERY>through all conventional cryptology.

433
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,090
<11-4,AVERY>还是破解不了
<11-4,AVERY>We can't crack it.

434
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,180
<11-5,CASTLE>什么意思
<11-5,CASTLE>Which means what?

435
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
<11-6,AVERY>要么我们不了解编码规则
<11-6,AVERY>There's either a reference key that we don't have

436
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,320
<11-6,AVERY>要么这就是一排随机数字
<11-6,AVERY>or the code itself is just a random string of numbers.

437
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,080
<11-7,SHAW>这绝对不是随机的
<11-7,SHAW>It's not random.

438
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,390
<11-7,SHAW>他买下一个人的手指
<11-7,SHAW>He bought another man's finger

439
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,410
<11-7,SHAW>留下指纹
<11-7,SHAW>so he could leave a print

440
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,770
<11-7,SHAW>给线索让我们找到这组数字
<11-7,SHAW>that would lead us directly to this code.

441
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,270
<11-7,SHAW>这是他嘲弄妮基的手段
<11-7,SHAW>It's how he taunts Nikki.

442
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,370
<11-7,SHAW>就像在说  以你的智商能揭开谜底吗
<11-7,SHAW>"Are you clever enough to solve my riddle?"

443
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,380
<11-7,SHAW>所以不管编码规则是什么
<11-7,SHAW>So whatever this reference key is,

444
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,610
<11-7,SHAW>他都认为你能发现
<11-7,SHAW>he thinks you can find it.

445
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,040
<11-8,BECKETT>这些数字能代表无数种含义
<11-8,BECKETT>Those numbers could mean anything.

446
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,280
<11-9,CASTLE>左边一栏都小于300
<11-9,CASTLE>Well, the left-hand column is less than 300.

447
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,280
<11-9,CASTLE>右边一栏不超过260
<11-9,CASTLE>Right-hand column is no more than 260.

448
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,990
<11-10,SHAW>成对组合很可能组合成一个字
<11-10,SHAW>And the combination of the joined pair most likely yields a word.

449
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,310
<11-11,CASTLE>就是字
<11-11,CASTLE>Words.

450
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,700
<11-11,CASTLE>应该是《希特热浪》
<11-11,CASTLE>It's "Heat wave."

451
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,810
<11-11,CASTLE>通常的排版
<11-11,CASTLE>When we typeset a manuscript,

452
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,190
<11-11,CASTLE>是一页300个字
<11-11,CASTLE>it's usually 300 words a page.

453
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,080
<11-11,CASTLE>但《希特热浪》不到三百页
<11-11,CASTLE>And "Heat wave" is less than 300 pages.

454
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,740
<11-11,CASTLE>第一栏是页码
<11-11,CASTLE>First column is a page number...

455
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,370
<11-13,CASTLE>79页  第二栏是单词
<11-13,CASTLE>79. Second column is a word.

456
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,430
<11-13,CASTLE>32  第33个字是  我
<11-13,CASTLE>32, 33. "I."

457
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,520
<11-14,SHAW>126页第80个字是  将
<11-14,SHAW>126--80, "Will."

<11-15,BECKETT>145页第204个字是  杀
<11-15,BECKETT>145--204, "Kill."

459
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,950
<11-16,CASTLE>我要杀
<11-16,CASTLE>"I will kill"...

460
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,650
<11-17,AVERY>等等  我在上传文档
<11-17,AVERY>Hang on. I'm uploading the text right now.

461
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,450
<11-16,CASTLE>我将在
<11-16,CASTLE>I will kill

462
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,320
<11-18,CASTLE>今晚午夜之前杀人
<11-18,CASTLE>someone else before

463
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,720
<11-18,CASTLE>除非你阻止我
<11-18,CASTLE>midnight tonight unless you stop me."

464
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,990
<11-19,BECKETT>午夜  还剩8小时
<11-19,BECKETT>Midnight. That's eight hours away.

465
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,100
<11-19,BECKETT>他给我们时限  挑战我们去阻止他
<11-19,BECKETT>He's putting us on the clock. He's daring us to stop him.

466
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,440
<12-1,CASTLE>还是用老方法吗
<12-1,CASTLE>Kickin' it old-school?

467
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,610
<12-2,BECKETT>白板对我来说总是有用
<12-2,BECKETT>The white board's always worked for me.

468
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,440
<12-2,BECKETT>我已经仔细检查过地铁路线
<12-2,BECKETT>I've been going over subway routes,

469
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,060
<12-2,BECKETT>希望能找出规律
<12-2,BECKETT>trying to see if I can trace a pattern

470
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,170
<12-2,BECKETT>从中央车站到旋转木马
<12-2,BECKETT>from Grand Central to the Carousel

471
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,600
<12-2,BECKETT>再到下一站  可到现在还毫无头绪
<12-2,BECKETT>to the next location, and so far, nothing definitive.

472
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,490
<12-3,CASTLE>也许他选择受害人
<12-3,CASTLE>Well, maybe there's something

473
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,520
<12-3,CASTLE>是遵循着什么规律的
<12-3,CASTLE>about how he chooses his victims.

474
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,560
<12-3,CASTLE>首先男性  然后女性
<12-3,CASTLE>First a man, then a woman.

475
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
<12-3,CASTLE>律师和遛狗人
<12-3,CASTLE>A lawyer and a dog walker?

476
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,590
<12-4,BECKETT>面对现实吧  根本没有规律
<12-4,BECKETT>Let's face it. There's no pattern there.

477
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,850
<12-4,BECKETT>不可能预测到他的下一个目标
<12-4,BECKETT>There's no way to predict where he's gonna go next,

478
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,580
<12-4,BECKETT>现在已经九点了  我们没时间了
<12-4,BECKETT>and it's already 9:00, and we're out of time.

479
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,850
<12-4,BECKETT>每一次谋杀  他都归因于妮基·希特
<12-4,BECKETT>And every murder he commits in the name of Nikki Heat...

480
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,380
<12-5,CASTLE>一位睿智的女性曾经告诉过我
<12-5,CASTLE>A very wise woman once told me,

481
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,180
<12-5,CASTLE>约翰·欣克利刺杀里根总统
<12-5,CASTLE>you can't blame Jodie Foster

482
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,390
<12-5,CASTLE>不能归罪于朱迪·福斯特
<12-5,CASTLE>for John Hinckley.

483
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,090
<12-5,CASTLE>但你可以因为影片《尼姆岛》责难她
<12-5,CASTLE>But you can blame her for "Nim's Island."

484
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,900
<12-7,MAN>有线索了  给艾弗里看看
<12-7,MAN>Lead just came in now. Let's get it to Avery.

485
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,450
<12-10,BECKETT>有什么线索
<12-10,BECKETT>What have you got?

486
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,980
<12-11,AVERY>绷带的化验结果出来了
<12-11,AVERY>Lab results came back on that bandage,

487
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,020
<12-11,AVERY>检测出了甲醛  甲醇和乙醇
<12-11,AVERY>tested positive for formaldehyde, methanol and ethanol.

488
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
<12-11,AVERY>-防腐液  -防腐液
<12-11,AVERY>- Embalming fluid.  - Embalming fluid.

489
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,340
<12-12,SHAW>鉴证组在中央车站发现了微量甲醛
<12-12,SHAW>The lab found traces of formaldehyde at Grand Central

490
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,770
<12-12,SHAW>在旋转木马发现了乙醇
<12-12,SHAW>and ethanol at the Carousel.

491
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,480
<12-13,CASTLE>凶手在太平间工作
<12-13,CASTLE>Our killer works at a mortuary.

492
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,690
<12-14,BECKETT>也许是医护人员
<12-14,BECKETT>Or he could be a hospital employee.

493
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,790
<12-14,BECKETT>或是太平间的门房
<12-14,BECKETT>Or a janitor at a morgue.

494
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,670
<12-15,SHAW>不对  卡塞尔的推论更有可能
<12-15,SHAW>No. Castle's theory is more likely.

495
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,470
<12-15,SHAW>调查全市所有太平间
<12-15,SHAW>Bring up all the mortuaries in the city.

496
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,020
<12-16,AVERY>单是纽约市区就有上千个太平间
<12-16,AVERY>We've got over a thousand in the New York city area alone.

497
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,410
<12-16,AVERY>不可能在午夜前全部排查
<12-16,AVERY>We can't hit all these before midnight.

498
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,530
<12-17,CASTLE>你能不能同时搜索一个人的
<12-17,CASTLE>Can you cross-reference mortuary experience

499
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,930
<12-17,CASTLE>犯罪记录和在太平间的工作经历
<12-17,CASTLE>with criminal records?

500
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,170
<12-18,SHAW>或有前科的求职者
<12-18,SHAW>Or job finder groups for ex-cons.

501
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,890
<12-19,CASTLE>-对  -我试试
<12-19,CASTLE>-Yes!  - I can try.

502
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,410
<12-20,AVERY>六个人
<12-20,AVERY>Six names.

503
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,250
<12-21,SHAW>各小组行动  午夜前
<12-21,SHAW>Mobilize the troops. I want every one of these guys

504
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,680
<12-21,SHAW>将他们全部收押
<12-21,SHAW>in our custody before midnight.

505
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,120
<12-21,SHAW>我明白了为什么你会说他有用
<12-21,SHAW>I see what you mean about him being helpful.

506
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,660
<13-1,MONTGOMERY>有没有可疑的殡仪人员
<13-1,MONTGOMERY>Any of these undertakers look good for it?

507
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,130
<13-2,CASTLE>他们的回答如出一辙
<13-2,CASTLE>They all say the same thing,

508
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,470
<13-2,CASTLE>"我们整天跟死人打交道
<13-2,CASTLE>"We work with dead bodies all day,

509
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,820
<13-2,CASTLE>不需要再制造死尸"
<13-2,CASTLE>we don't need to make more."

510
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,630
<13-3,BECKETT>这是他的诱饵  和那个指纹一样
<13-3,BECKETT>He baited us, just like with that fingerprint.

511
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,250
<13-3,BECKETT>我们在浪费时间
<13-3,BECKETT>We're wasting our time.

512
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,910
<13-4,RYAN>他打来电话  找妮基·希特
<13-4,RYAN>He's on the phone. He's asking for Nikki Heat.

513
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,690
<13-5,SHAW>我们在追踪电话
<13-5,SHAW>We're tracing the call.

514
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,830
<13-6,BECKETT>喂
<13-6,BECKETT>Hello.

515
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,970
<13-6,BECKETT>妮基
<13-6,BECKETT>Nikki?

516
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,530
<13-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>你应该阻止我的
<13-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>You were supposed to stop me.

517
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,180
<13-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>我想让你阻止我
<13-7,MAN ON THE PHONE>I wanted you to stop me.

518
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,510
<13-8,BECKETT>告诉我你在哪里
<13-8,BECKETT>Tell me where you are.

519
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,280
<13-9,MAN>你会一个人过来吗
<13-9,MAN>Will you come alone?

520
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,980
<13-10,BECKETT>是的  就你跟我
<13-10,BECKETT>Yes, just you and me.

521
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,340
<13-10,BECKETT>我们可以解决问题
<13-10,BECKETT>We can figure this out.

522
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
<13-10,BECKETT>我可以帮你  你只需相信我
<13-10,BECKETT>I can help you. You just need to trust me.

523
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,290
<13-11,MAN>告诉我
<13-11,MAN>Tell me something...

524
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,580
<13-11,MAN>失败的滋味如何
<13-11,MAN>how does it feel to know that you have failed?

525
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,010
<14-1,SHAW>检查楼道  派一队人上楼顶
<14-1,SHAW>Check the stairs. Get a unit on the roof.

526
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,910
<14-1,SHAW>监控整栋大楼
<14-1,SHAW>I want eyes on every inch of this structure.

527
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,680
<14-2,BECKETT>他刚刚还在这里  尸体不会太远
<14-2,BECKETT>He was just here. That body can't be too far.

528
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,420
<14-3,RYAN>看这里有一滩血
<14-3,RYAN>Over here! A lot of blood.

529
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,120
<14-3,RYAN>一只女人的鞋
<14-3,RYAN>A woman's shoe.

530
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,290
<14-3,RYAN>鞋跟断了
<14-3,RYAN>Got a broken heel.

531
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,540
<14-4,SHAW>还有几缕头发
<14-4,SHAW>Strands of hair.

532
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,020
<14-4,SHAW>看起来她挣扎过
<14-4,SHAW>Looks like she put up a fight.

533
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,190
<14-5,BECKETT>这里有四个弹壳
<14-5,BECKETT>There's four shell casings.

534
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,400
<14-5,BECKETT>没有抢救措施  她不可能还活着
<14-5,BECKETT>There's no way she would've survived without medical attention.

535
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,480
<14-6,CASTLE>那尸体在哪里
<14-6,CASTLE>Then where's the body?

536
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,660
<14-6,CASTLE>他总把尸体留在犯案现场
<14-6,CASTLE>He always leaves the body where he kills.

537
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,510
<14-7,SHAW>并且总在人流密集的惹眼地点作案
<14-7,SHAW>And he always kills in famous places with lots of foot traffic.

538
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,750
<14-7,SHAW>他在改变作案方式
<14-7,SHAW>He's changing his M.O.

539
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,200
<14-8,CASTLE>这下更难预测他的行动
<14-8,CASTLE>Which makes him more unpredictable,

540
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,400
<14-8,CASTLE>他也变得更危险了
<14-8,CASTLE>which makes him more dangerous.

541
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,020
<14-9,AVERY>整栋楼都搜遍了  没有尸体
<14-9,AVERY>Structure's clear. There's no body.

542
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,020
<14-10,SHAW>他到底把她放哪儿了
<14-10,SHAW>Where the hell did he put her?

543
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,090
<14-11,BECKETT>他把她放进车尾箱了
<14-11,BECKETT>He put her in his trunk.

544
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,120
<14-11,BECKETT>血迹到这里就没有了
<14-11,BECKETT>That blood trail ends right here.

545
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,410
<14-12,CASTLE>他守株待兔  也许车都没熄火
<14-12,CASTLE>So he waited, probably left his car idling,

546
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,030
<14-12,CASTLE>行凶后  打开车尾箱把她放进去
<14-12,CASTLE>takes down his victim, popped his trunk, put her in,

547
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,660
<14-12,CASTLE>开车离开  尸体就在车上
<14-12,CASTLE>drove away, body on board.

548
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,430
<14-13,SHAW>叫停车场保安
<14-13,SHAW>Get the parking attendant

549
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,370
<14-13,SHAW>提供所有车辆资料
<14-13,SHAW>to give us a list of all the vehicles through here

550
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,620
<14-13,SHAW>还有监控录像
<14-13,SHAW>and the video footage.

551
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,460
<14-15,CASTLE>你觉得他会用自己的车吗
<14-15,CASTLE>You think he used his own car?

552
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,270
<14-15,CASTLE>不会  但如果是今晚偷来的车
<14-15,CASTLE>No, but if he stole it tonight,

553
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,670
<14-16,SHAW>他也许来不及换车牌
<14-16,SHAW>he might not have had time to switch the plates.

554
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,860
<14-16,SHAW>发布全面通缉令
<14-16,SHAW>We put out an A.P.B.

555
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,740
<14-17,BECKETT>我让手下去拿每月
<14-17,BECKETT>I'll get my guys to get a roster of all the people who had

556
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,730
<14-17,BECKETT>在这层停车的车主名单
<14-17,BECKETT>monthlies on this floor.

557
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,530
<14-18,SHAW>我的手下已经去拿了
<14-18,SHAW>My people are already on it.

558
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,470
<14-18,SHAW>我手下的人比你多
<14-18,SHAW>I got way more people than you do.

559
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,260
<14-18,SHAW>你上司已经派人保护了你的公寓
<14-18,SHAW>Your captain has a unit on your apartment.

560
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,840
<14-18,SHAW>-回家休息  -不需要
<14-18,SHAW>- Go home. Get some rest.  - It's not necess--

561
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,220
<14-20,SHAW>别争了  你要是累垮了对我也没好处
<14-20,SHAW>No argument. You're no good to me if you're burned out.

562
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,880
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>他像困兽一样在发狂地咆哮
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>He roars like an angry, caged animal.

563
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,120
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>注意力全放在舱门外
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>Concentrate towards the outer hatch area.

564
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,950
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>他的手好像没有因为爆炸而受伤
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>The blows don't seem to be injuring his hands.

565
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,970
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>我没看见血
<15-1,MARTHA ON TELEVISON>There's no--there's no blood that I can see.

566
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,210
<15-4,CASTLE>为什么还不睡
<15-4,CASTLE>What are you still doing up?

567
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,560
<15-5,MARTHA>睡不着  脑子很乱
<15-5,MARTHA>Oh, can't sleep. Too much on my mind.

568
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,160
<15-5,MARTHA>做决定不容易啊
<15-5,MARTHA>You know, decisions to make and...

569
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,220
<15-6,CASTLE>你的婚礼录影带之一
<15-6,CASTLE>Wow. One of your old wedding videos.

570
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,580
<15-7,MARTHA>少来了
<15-7,MARTHA>Oh-ho-ho. Are you kidding?

571
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,200
<15-7,MARTHA>和我前夫们相比  这家伙简直小菜一碟
<15-7,MARTHA>This guy's a pushover compared to my ex-husbands.

572
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,880
<15-8,CASTLE>这么说优势大过于劣势了吗
<15-8,CASTLE>So the pros outweighed the cons?

573
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,000
<15-9,MARTHA>亲爱的  暂停你这儿并非长久之计
<15-9,MARTHA>Darling, this was always supposed to be a temporary situation

574
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,750
<15-9,MARTHA>我最终要过回我自己的生活
<15-9,MARTHA>un-until I got back on my feet, you know.

575
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,150
<15-10,CASTLE>姓罗杰斯的女人总是随心所欲
<15-10,CASTLE>Well, the Rodgers women always follow their hearts.

576
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,230
<15-10,CASTLE>没错
<15-10,CASTLE>Yeah.

577
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,980
<15-11,MARTHA>你没事吧
<15-11,MARTHA>You okay?

578
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,630
<15-12,CASTLE>这个案子...
<15-12,CASTLE>This case, it just...

579
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,810
<15-12,CASTLE>如果不是因为我的书
<15-12,CASTLE>If it wasn't for my book--

580
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,940
<15-13,MARTHA>你打算怎么做  亲爱的
<15-13,MARTHA>What are you gonna do, darling,

581
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,280
<15-13,MARTHA>因为某些白痴神经短路  就不写了吗
<15-13,MARTHA>Stop writing because some idiot has got a screw loose?

582
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,340
<15-13,MARTHA>不是  只是
<15-13,MARTHA>No, it's just...

583
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,420
<15-14,CASTLE>我从未想过要让她置身险境
<15-14,CASTLE>I never intended to put her in harm's way.

584
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,420
<15-15,MARTHA>就我所知的凯特·贝克特
<15-15,MARTHA>Let me tell you something about Kate Beckett.

585
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,020
<15-15,MARTHA>她会照顾好自己
<15-15,MARTHA>That gal can take care of herself.

586
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,560
<16-1,CASTLE>真的
<16-1,CASTLE>Really.

587
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,680
<16-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你来这里干嘛
<16-2,BECKETT>Castle? What are you doing here?

588
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,770
<16-2,BECKETT>喝红酒吗
<16-2,BECKETT>Wine?

589
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,520
<16-3,CASTLE>你的保镖们去哪儿了
<16-3,CASTLE>So what happened to your security detail?

590
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,740
<16-3,CASTLE>我没看到外面有人
<16-3,CASTLE>I didn't see anyone outside.

591
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,690
<16-4,BECKETT>我回来后  就让他们回家了
<16-4,BECKETT>I sent them home after I got in.

592
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,890
<16-4,BECKETT>怎么了
<16-4,BECKETT>What?

593
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,430
<16-5,BECKETT>窗户和门都锁好了
<16-5,BECKETT>The windows are locked, the door is locked,

594
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,640
<16-5,BECKETT>我有枪
<16-5,BECKETT>I'm armed.

595
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,410
<16-5,BECKETT>之前凶手都弃尸在作案现场
<16-5,BECKETT>So our guy killed the others where they were found.

596
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,310
<16-5,BECKETT>为何这个女孩例外呢
<16-5,BECKETT>Why not this girl?

597
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,070
<16-5,BECKETT>为何凶手不把她留在停车场
<16-5,BECKETT>Why didn't he just leave her in the garage where we'd find her?

598
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,450
<16-6,CASTLE>他改变作案方式了
<16-6,CASTLE>He's changing it up.

599
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,630
<16-7,BECKETT>可能这个死者很特别
<16-7,BECKETT>Or this victim is special.

600
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,630
<16-7,BECKETT>我不喝  谢谢
<16-7,BECKETT>Oh, no, thanks.

601
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,210
<16-8,CASTLE>喝吧  特工肖说我们需要减压
<16-8,CASTLE>No, no, Agent Shaw said we need to decompress.

602
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,130
<16-8,CASTLE>2000年产自教皇新城堡  减压佳酿
<16-8,CASTLE>Nothing decompresses like a 2000 chateauneuf-du-Pape.

603
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,050
<16-9,BECKETT>好吧  如果特工肖真这么说过
<16-9,BECKETT>Oh, well, if special Agent Shaw said so...

604
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,450
<16-10,CASTLE>-这是什么意思  -没什么
<16-10,CASTLE>- What is that supposed to mean?  - Nothing.

605
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,870
<16-11,BECKETT>你听她说话时的样子还有
<16-11,BECKETT>I just see the way that you listen to her,

606
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,600
<16-11,BECKETT>看那些高档设备时的样子  我都看在眼里
<16-11,BECKETT>the way that you look at all of her fancy equipment.

607
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,130
<16-11,BECKETT>现在我的普通白板已经不上档次了
<16-11,BECKETT>Now my murder board's not enough for you?

608
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,120
<16-11,BECKETT>-她那个智能板你才看得上眼  -你吃醋了
<16-11,BECKETT>- Now you need a smart board? - Are you jealous?

609
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,330
<16-13,BECKETT>我不是吃醋  只是尴尬
<16-13,BECKETT>I'm not jealous. I'm just embarrassed...

610
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,910
<16-13,BECKETT>你的表现就像个十岁小孩
<16-13,BECKETT>The way that you act like a 10 year old,

611
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,700
<16-13,BECKETT>那么崇拜她的二维条码
<16-13,BECKETT>all impressed by her data matrix.

612
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,410
<16-13,BECKETT>"处理信息太迅速了  特工肖
<16-13,BECKETT>"Oh, it collates information so quickly, Agent Shaw.

613
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,630
<16-13,BECKETT>给我讲讲吧"
<16-13,BECKETT>Tell me all about it."

614
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,630
<16-14,CASTLE>你还真够离谱的
<16-14,CASTLE>You are ridiculous.

615
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:03,030
<16-15,BECKETT>最糟糕的是  你居然和她一起推理
<16-15,BECKETT>And then to top it off, you are now building theory with her.

616
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,670
<16-16,CASTLE>怎么了
<16-16,CASTLE>So?

617
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,670
<16-17,BECKETT>你本应该和我一起推理
<16-17,BECKETT>So you're supposed to be building theory with me.

618
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,330
<16-17,BECKETT>你本应是我团队里的一员
<16-17,BECKETT>You're supposed to be on my team.

619
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,810
<16-18,CASTLE>我们和特工肖也是同一团队啊
<16-18,CASTLE>Well, I thought we were all on the same team.

620
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,520
<16-19,BECKETT>没错  只是如果你灵光一闪
<16-19,BECKETT>We are. It's just... I think that if you have an insight,

621
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,240
<16-19,BECKETT>应该第一个告诉我
<16-19,BECKETT>you should run it by me first.

622
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,200
<16-20,CASTLE>我会的  喝你的红酒吧
<16-20,CASTLE>Fine. I will. Now drink your wine.

623
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,530
<16-20,CASTLE>谢谢
<16-20,CASTLE>Thanks.

624
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,720
<16-21,BECKETT>但我累了
<16-21,BECKETT>But I am tired.

625
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,420
<16-21,BECKETT>我要睡觉了
<16-21,BECKETT>And... I need to go to bed.

626
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,750
<16-22,CASTLE>不  我不会走的
<16-22,CASTLE>Oh, no. I'm not leaving.

627
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,230
<16-22,CASTLE>我是来保护你的
<16-22,CASTLE>I'm here to protect you.

628
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,820
<16-23,BECKETT>什么  就凭你的唇枪舌剑吗
<16-23,BECKETT>What, with your vast arsenal of rapier wit?

629
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,620
<16-24,CASTLE>因为我  外面有个疯子要杀你
<16-24,CASTLE>There is a madman gunning for you because of me.

630
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,590
<16-24,CASTLE>我不会留下你一个人的
<16-24,CASTLE>I am not going to leave you alone.

631
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,050
<16-25,BECKETT>好吧  我太累了不想吵架
<16-25,BECKETT>Okay, fine. I am too tired to argue.

632
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,230
<16-25,BECKETT>但如果让我看见门把手动了
<16-25,BECKETT>But if I see that doorknob turn,

633
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,830
<16-25,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生  注意了
<16-25,BECKETT>I will have you know Mr. Castle,

634
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,040
<16-25,BECKETT>-我睡觉时也握着枪  -明白
<16-25,BECKETT>- that I sleep with a gun.  - Understood.

635
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,310
<17-1,BECKETT>你还在这儿  你在做薄饼吗
<17-1,BECKETT>You're still here... and you're making pancakes?

636
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,710
<17-2,CASTLE>我本来想做熏肉鸡蛋  但鸡蛋过期了
<17-2,CASTLE>I was hoping for bacon and eggs, but your eggs are expired

637
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,260
<17-2,CASTLE>还有你家的熏肉长毛了
<17-2,CASTLE>and your bacon has something furry on it.

638
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,610
<17-3,BECKETT>我几乎都是叫外卖
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I mostly order in.

639
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,050
<17-4,CASTLE>我从冰箱里堆积如山的
<17-4,CASTLE>I figured that from the styrofoam temple

640
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,720
<17-4,CASTLE>塑料外卖盒看出来了
<17-4,CASTLE>you've got going on in that refrigerator.

641
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,740
<17-4,CASTLE>咖啡煮好了  不过我觉得过滤器坏了
<17-4,CASTLE>Coffee's brewed. I think your filter's broken though.

642
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,410
<17-4,CASTLE>我稍后为你订个新的
<17-4,CASTLE>I'll order you a new one later.

643
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,740
<17-5,BECKETT>你可真周到啊
<17-5,BECKETT>Wow. Looks like you thought of everything.

644
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,760
<17-6,CASTLE>除了报纸
<17-6,CASTLE>Except the paper.

645
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,760
<17-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们没时间看报纸
<17-7,BECKETT>Castle, we don't have time for the paper.

646
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,490
<17-7,BECKETT>有具尸体等着我们去找呢
<17-7,BECKETT>There's a body out there that I gotta find.

647
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,640
<17-8,CASTLE>看来她找到你了
<17-8,CASTLE>Looks like it found you.

648
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,400
<17-9,RYAN>你们刚刚起床  对吗
<17-9,RYAN>So you had just gotten up, right?

649
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,810
<17-10,BECKETT>是的  卡塞尔刚做好早餐
<17-10,BECKETT>Yeah. Castle just finished making breakfast,

650
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,120
<17-10,BECKETT>接着他走到门前
<17-10,BECKETT>and he went to the door--

651
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,840
<17-11,RYAN>怎样的早餐
<17-11,RYAN>What kind of breakfast?

652
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,320
<17-12,BECKETT>什么
<17-12,BECKETT>Uh, I'm sorry?

653
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,780
<17-13,RYAN>他做的什么早餐
<17-13,RYAN>What kind of breakfast was he making?

654
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,990
<17-14,BECKETT>薄饼
<17-14,BECKETT>Pancakes.

655
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,020
<17-15,RYAN>真有居家的感觉啊
<17-15,RYAN>Well, isn't that domestic?

656
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,510
<17-15,RYAN>回到正题
<17-15,RYAN>Anyway,

657
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,450
<17-16,BECKETT>报纸通常4点到  我们7点起的
<17-16,BECKETT>the paper usually arrives at 4:00, and we were up at 7:00.

658
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,010
<17-16,BECKETT>就是说凶手有三小时的时间
<17-16,BECKETT>So that means the killer had a 3-hour window

659
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,670
<17-16,BECKETT>可以把尸体放在那里而不被人发现
<17-16,BECKETT>where he could've left the body there unnoticed.

660
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,620
<17-17,RYAN>那你和卡塞尔先生
<17-17,RYAN>And exactly what time

661
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,720
<17-17,RYAN>昨晚上床睡觉时间是几点
<17-17,RYAN>did you and Mr. Castle go to bed last night?

662
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,330
<17-18,BECKETT>口供已经录完了
<17-18,BECKETT>I think we're done here.

663
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,530
<17-19,ESPOSITO>老兄  我看见贝克特穿着睡衣
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Dude, I see Beckett in her jammies...

664
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,410
<17-19,ESPOSITO>桌上还有红酒杯
<17-19,ESPOSITO>wine glasses on the table.

665
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,900
<17-20,CASTLE>贝克特和我什么也没发生
<17-20,CASTLE>There's nothing going on with Beckett and me.

666
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,310
<17-20,CASTLE>我们的关系和以前一样
<17-20,CASTLE>No more than there was yesterday.

667
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,240
<17-21,RYAN>老兄  你给她做薄饼
<17-21,RYAN>Dude, you made her pancakes?

668
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,760
<17-22,CASTLE>早餐而已
<17-22,CASTLE>It's just breakfast.

669
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,290
<17-23,ESPOSITO>薄饼可不只是早餐而已
<17-23,ESPOSITO>Pancakes is not just breakfast.

670
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,600
<17-23,ESPOSITO>这是用食物来表达
<17-23,ESPOSITO>It's an edible way of saying,

671
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,770
<17-23,ESPOSITO>"非常感谢美妙的一夜"
<17-23,ESPOSITO>"Thank you so much for last night."

672
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,650
<17-24,RYAN>卡塞尔  我们是哥们儿
<17-24,RYAN>Castle, come on. We're your friends.

673
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,050
<17-24,RYAN>透露点细节
<17-24,RYAN>Details.

674
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,800
<17-25,CASTLE>好吧  靠近点
<17-25,CASTLE>All right. Come here.

675
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,860
<17-26,CASTLE>没有细节
<17-26,CASTLE>There are no details.

676
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,520
<17-27,ESPOSITO>我现在都无法正视你
<17-27,ESPOSITO>I can't even look at you right now.

677
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,190
<17-28,RYAN>目击证人拒绝合作
<17-28,RYAN>Witness refuses to cooperate.

678
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,440
<17-29,SHAW>现在知道他带走尸体的原因了
<17-29,SHAW>Now we know why he took the body.

679
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,040
<17-30,BECKETT>"我知道你住在哪儿"  这是恐吓
<17-30,BECKETT>"I know where you live." This was a threat.

680
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,150
<17-30,BECKETT>不只是恐吓
<17-30,BECKETT>More than that.

681
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,550
<17-31,SHAW>他是说他对你很失望
<17-31,SHAW>He's saying he's disappointed in you.

682
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,150
<17-31,SHAW>他的想法是
<17-31,SHAW>In his mind,

683
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,720
<17-31,SHAW>他已经事先警告你他会再次行凶
<17-31,SHAW>he gave you fair warning that he was going to kill again.

684
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,600
<17-31,SHAW>要是你再聪明一点  你本可以阻止他
<17-31,SHAW>If you had been smarter, you would've been able to stop him.

685
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,400
<17-31,SHAW>他在暗示  "她因你而亡"
<17-31,SHAW>He's saying, "This one is on you."

686
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,440
<17-31,SHAW>我只是在分析他  探长
<17-31,SHAW>I'm profiling him, Detective,

687
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,990
<17-31,SHAW>不是附和他
<17-31,SHAW>not agreeing with him.

688
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,660
<17-31,SHAW>这家伙是个疯子
<17-31,SHAW>The guy is a friggin' nut bar.

689
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,560
<17-31,SHAW>不要受他的影响
<17-31,SHAW>Don't let him get to you.

690
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,960
<17-32,CASTLE>这个标题够讽刺的吧
<17-32,CASTLE>Talk about irony.

692
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,950
<17-33,BECKETT>-知道死者的身份吗  -现在还不知道
<17-33,BECKETT>- Do we have an I.D. on our vic? - No, not yet.

693
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,000
<17-34,SHAW>没有手提包  也没接到失踪人口的报案
<17-34,SHAW>There's no purse, no missing person's report filed.

694
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,180
<17-34,SHAW>验尸官的车在楼下
<17-34,SHAW>The coroner's van's downstairs.

695
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,320
<17-34,SHAW>我们要把尸体运到停尸房
<17-34,SHAW>We need to get the body to the morgue

696
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,480
<17-34,SHAW>把子弹取出来
<17-34,SHAW>and pull the slugs.

697
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,950
<17-34,SHAW>四处枪伤
<17-34,SHAW>Only four entry wounds.

698
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,450
<17-34,SHAW>如果犯罪手法没有变化
<17-34,SHAW>If the pattern holds,

699
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,490
<17-35,BECKETT>他会给我们留下一个四个字母的单词
<17-35,BECKETT>he should have a 4-letter word for us.

700
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,530
<17-35,BECKETT>真有意思
<17-35,BECKETT>That's funny.

701
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,390
<17-35,BECKETT>我也有一个四个字母的单词给他
<17-35,BECKETT>I have a 4-letter word for him, too.

702
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,390
<17-36,SHAW>你们两个护送运尸车吧
<17-36,SHAW>Why don't you two escort the body to the morgue

703
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,560
<17-36,SHAW>有什么发现通知我
<17-36,SHAW>and let me know what you find?

704
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,960
<17-38,SHAW>当然  先把衣服穿好
<17-38,SHAW>Once you're dressed, of course.

705
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,500
<18-1,LANIE>听说尸体被发现的时候
<18-1,LANIE>Hey. Heard you two were making pancakes

706
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,210
<18-1,LANIE>你俩正在煎薄饼
<18-1,LANIE>when the body dropped.

707
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,840
<18-2,BECKETT>-什么都没发生  -是啊
<18-2,BECKETT>- Nothing happened. - Right.

708
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,710
<18-4,BECKETT>你有什么发现吗
<18-4,BECKETT>So what do you got?

709
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,280
<18-5,LANIE>弹壳上有字母
<18-5,LANIE>Letters on the slugs.

710
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,510
<18-5,LANIE>"B-u-r-"
<18-5,LANIE>"B-u-r--"

711
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,950
<18-6,BECKETT>"燃烧"  妮基将身陷火海
<18-6,BECKETT>"Burn." Nikki will burn.

712
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,790
<18-7,CASTLE>真吓人
<18-7,CASTLE>Well, that's chilling.

713
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,520
<18-8,BECKETT>系统中没有死者的指纹
<18-8,BECKETT>Our victim's fingerprints aren't in the system.

714
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,550
<18-8,BECKETT>你有什么能鉴别她身份的发现吗
<18-8,BECKETT>Do you have anything that can I.D. her?

715
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,480
<18-9,LANIE>我在她身上发现了甲醛
<18-9,LANIE>Well, I found formaldehyde on her.

716
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,570
<18-10,BECKETT>那是凶手身上的
<18-10,BECKETT>Yeah, that's from the killer.

717
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,000
<18-10,BECKETT>他在其他犯罪现场也留下了
<18-10,BECKETT>He left it at the other scenes as well.

718
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,800
<18-11,LANIE>不是微量的
<18-11,LANIE>Not traces.

719
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,250
<18-11,LANIE>是在她指甲缝和头发里发现的
<18-11,LANIE>It was under her fingernails, in her hair.

720
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,000
<18-11,LANIE>她的工作需要接触防腐液
<18-11,LANIE>She worked with embalming fluid.

721
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,080
<18-11,LANIE>我还发现了微量的泥土
<18-11,LANIE>I also found traces of clay,

722
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,400
<18-11,LANIE>聚安酯和动物血液
<18-11,LANIE>polyurethane and animal blood.

723
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,300
<18-11,LANIE>我不知道她是谁  但我知道她的职业
<18-11,LANIE>I don't know who she is, but I can tell you what she does.

724
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,800
<18-11,LANIE>她是动物标本剥制师
<18-11,LANIE>She's a taxidermist.

725
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,110
<18-12,LANIE>你俩异口同声的样子真是太可爱了
<18-12,LANIE>It's so cute, the way you two do that.

726
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,580
<19-1,SHAW>剥制术
<19-1,SHAW>Taxidermy?

727
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,860
<19-2,CASTLE>防腐液和动物毛发是
<19-2,CASTLE>Embalming fluid plus animal hair

728
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,330
<19-2,CASTLE>诺曼·贝茨最爱的消遣活动[《惊魂记》男主角]
<19-2,CASTLE>equals Norman Bates' favorite pastime.

729
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,330
<19-3,BECKETT>在前两个凶案现场我们也发现了防腐液
<19-3,BECKETT>It can't be just a coincidence that we found embalming fluid

730
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,640
<19-3,BECKETT>这不可能仅仅是个巧合
<19-3,BECKETT>at our first two crime scenes as well.

731
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,310
<19-4,SHAW>所以凶手和第三位死者有关联
<19-4,SHAW>So the killer and this victim were connected.

732
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,100
<19-5,BECKETT>似乎如此
<19-5,BECKETT>It seems so.

733
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,010
<19-5,BECKETT>市区只有七家动物标本商店
<19-5,BECKETT>So there's only seven taxidermy shops in the city.

734
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,800
<19-5,BECKETT>我的手下正在逐个排查
<19-5,BECKETT>My guys are running them down right now.

735
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,390
<19-6,SHAW>但是如果他们之间有交集
<19-6,SHAW>But if there was a connection between them,

736
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,900
<19-6,SHAW>对比处理系统怎么没有发现
<19-6,SHAW>why didn't comparison matrix find it?

737
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,150
<19-7,BECKETT>可能不是同事或者去同一家健身房
<19-7,BECKETT>Maybe it's not as simple as a work relationship

738
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,620
<19-7,BECKETT>那么简单的联系
<19-7,BECKETT>or going to the same gym.

739
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,280
<19-7,BECKETT>就像你说的  得用心去理解罪犯的心理
<19-7,BECKETT>Like you said, it takes a mind to hunt a mind.

740
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,460
<19-8,ESPOSITO>第三名死者的身份确认了
<19-8,ESPOSITO>We got an I.D. on our third vic.

741
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,430
<19-8,ESPOSITO>她叫桑德拉·凯勒
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Her name is Sandra Keller.

742
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,570
<19-8,ESPOSITO>在市中心的一家标本商店工作
<19-8,ESPOSITO>She works at a taxidermy shop downtown.

743
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,860
<19-9,BECKETT>她和凶手有什么关系吗
<19-9,BECKETT>Any connection between her and our killer?

744
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,960
<19-10,RYAN>她的同事声称死者曾与一男性顾客争执
<19-10,RYAN>A colleague of hers said she had a run-in with a guy

745
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,080
<19-10,RYAN>该男子长相可能与画像相符
<19-10,RYAN>who maybe matched our sketch--

746
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,830
<19-10,RYAN>他的比熊犬
<19-10,RYAN>a customer whose bichon frise

747
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,750
<19-10,RYAN>被公园里的一只罗特威尔牧犬咬死
<19-10,RYAN>had been killed in the park by another dog--a rottweiler.

748
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,780
<19-11,ESPOSITO>这位顾客悲痛欲绝  他预付一半费用
<19-11,ESPOSITO>Customer was heartbroken. He paid half up front to have his

749
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,640
<19-11,ESPOSITO>想把"南瓜先生"做成标本永久保存
<19-11,ESPOSITO>Mr. Bumpkins preserved for eternity.

750
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,230
<19-11,ESPOSITO>但当他回来取标本的时候
<19-11,ESPOSITO>When he came back to pick up his dog,

751
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,640
<19-11,ESPOSITO>却拿不出剩余的费用
<19-11,ESPOSITO>didn't have the fee.

752
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,640
<19-12,RYAN>桑德拉拒绝交出"南瓜先生"的标本
<19-12,RYAN>When Sandra refused to give up stuffed Bumpkins,

753
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,580
<19-12,RYAN>该男子大怒  然后冲出商店
<19-12,RYAN>the guy went ballistic and stormed out of the store.

754
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,310
<19-12,RYAN>事发两天后的晚上  商店被盗
<19-12,RYAN>Two nights later, they had a break-in.

755
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,480
<19-12,RYAN>失窃的物品包括该男子的
<19-12,RYAN>Among the things that went missing are this guy's

756
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,000
<19-12,RYAN>比熊犬标本和几罐防腐液
<19-12,RYAN>stuffed bichon frise and a bunch of embalming fluid.

757
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,780
<19-13,SHAW>这就解释了我们在现场发现的微量防腐液
<19-13,SHAW>That explains why we found traces of it at the murder scenes.

758
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,220
<19-14,ESPOSITO>该男子还破坏了商店的电脑
<19-14,ESPOSITO>He also trashed the store's computer.

759
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,240
<19-14,ESPOSITO>所有客户的名字和资料都没了
<19-14,ESPOSITO>There's no client data, no name.

760
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,820
<19-15,SHAW>我的探员们询问了所有
<19-15,SHAW>My agents interviewed all of

<19-15,SHAW>委托米歇尔·刘易斯溜狗的客户
<19-15,SHAW>Michelle Lewis' dog walking clients.

762
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,360
<19-15,SHAW>一对情侣被迫人道毁灭他们的罗特威尔牧犬
<19-15,SHAW>One couple had to put their rottweiler down because

763
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,610
<19-15,SHAW>因为米歇尔没能控制住它
<19-15,SHAW>Michelle lost control of it,

764
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:04,190
<19-15,SHAW>导致其咬死了一只狗
<19-15,SHAW>and it killed another dog.

765
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,530
<19-16,CASTLE>死的是"南瓜先生"  所以在悲伤的打击之下
<19-16,CASTLE>Mr. Bumpkins. So grief-stricken,

766
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,820
<19-16,CASTLE>凶手将爱犬之死
<19-16,CASTLE>our killer blames Michelle and Sandra

767
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,520
<19-16,CASTLE>归咎于米歇尔和桑德拉  他决定报复
<19-16,CASTLE>for the loss of his best friend and decides to get revenge.

768
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,830
<19-17,BECKETT>为一只狗杀了三个人
<19-17,BECKETT>All of this about a dog?

769
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,050
<19-17,BECKETT>这和妮基·希特有什么关系
<19-17,BECKETT>What does this have to do with Nikki Heat?

770
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,840
<19-18,SHAW>狗是导火索
<19-18,SHAW>The dog's the trigger.

771
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,150
<19-18,SHAW>也许小狗死的时候凶手正在看这本书
<19-18,SHAW>Maybe he was reading the book when it was killed.

772
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,850
<19-18,SHAW>当他崩溃的时候
<19-18,SHAW>When he snapped,

773
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,300
<19-18,SHAW>不知怎么他就把这事归咎于妮基了
<19-18,SHAW>he somehow blamed Nikki for it.

774
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,490
<19-19,BECKETT>听起来有点荒唐
<19-19,BECKETT>It seems a little absurd.

775
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,720
<19-20,SHAW>你肯定是个爱猫之人  探长
<19-20,SHAW>You must be a cat lover, Detective.

776
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,610
<19-20,SHAW>他在为杀人找理由  这就是理由
<19-20,SHAW>He's looking for a reason to kill. This is it.

777
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,480
<19-21,ESPOSITO>那第一名死者呢
<19-21,ESPOSITO>What about our first vic?

778
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,280
<19-21,ESPOSITO>彼得曼是怎么被卷进去的
<19-21,ESPOSITO>How does Peterman fit in to all this?

779
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,110
<19-22,CASTLE>他是一名人身伤害诉讼律师
<19-22,CASTLE>Well, he was a personal injury lawyer.

780
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,590
<19-22,CASTLE>可能凶手想提出一起
<19-22,CASTLE>Maybe our murderer wanted to file

781
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,410
<19-22,CASTLE>人为过失致狗死亡的诉讼
<19-22,CASTLE>a wrongful doggy death suit.

782
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,210
<19-22,CASTLE>根据彼得曼的记录
<19-22,CASTLE>According to Peterman's notes,

783
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,810
<19-23,AVERY>一月  他曾与本·康纳德见面
<19-23,AVERY>Back in January, he had a meeting with a Ben Conrad

784
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,850
<19-23,AVERY>讨论一起狗死亡的诉讼
<19-23,AVERY>over a lawsuit about a dead dog.

785
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,410
<19-23,AVERY>但彼得曼拒绝接手此案
<19-23,AVERY>Peterman declined to take the case though.

786
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,300
<19-24,CASTLE>这就是拼图的最后一块
<19-24,CASTLE>That's the last piece of our puzzle.

787
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,910
<19-25,BECKETT>关于康纳德有什么资料
<19-25,BECKETT>What do you have on Conrad?

788
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,810
<19-26,AVERY>只有一张车管局的照片
<19-26,AVERY>Just a photo from the D.M.V.

789
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,320
<19-27,SHAW>找到你了  你这疯杂种
<19-27,SHAW>Got you, you son of a bitch.

790
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,360
<19-27,SHAW>是的
<19-27,SHAW>Yeah.

791
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,240
<19-27,SHAW>好的
<19-27,SHAW>Okay.

792
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,070
<20-1,SHAW>好  亲爱的
<20-1,SHAW>Okay, sweetie.

793
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,480
<20-1,SHAW>妈妈要去抓坏人了  好吗
<20-1,SHAW>Mommy's gotta go arrest somebody, okay?

794
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,450
<20-1,SHAW>我会回家吃晚饭的  好的  我爱你
<20-1,SHAW>I'll be home for dinner. All right. I love you.

795
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,620
<20-1,SHAW>拜拜
<20-1,SHAW>Bye.

796
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,290
<20-2,BECKETT>-你是位母亲  -是啊
<20-2,BECKETT>- You're a mom? - Yeah.

797
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,680
<20-3,SHAW>你可以把枪收起来了
<20-3,SHAW>And you can holster your gun.

798
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,670
<20-3,SHAW>你们两个留在这里
<20-3,SHAW>You're both staying here.

799
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,760
<20-4,CASTLE>什么  别这样
<20-4,CASTLE>What? No, come no.

800
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,450
<20-4,CASTLE>这是最后的缉捕  你不能让她这么做
<20-4,CASTLE>This is the final takedown. You can't let her do this to us.

801
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,500
<20-5,BECKETT>特工肖说的对  我是他的目标
<20-5,BECKETT>No, Agent Shaw is right. I'm his target.

802
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,000
<20-5,BECKETT>我要是步入交火区
<20-5,BECKETT>I can't compromise your team

803
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,210
<20-5,BECKETT>会成为包袱
<20-5,BECKETT>by walking into the line of fire.

804
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,280
<20-6,SHAW>我们会把他拿下的  犯人还是你的
<20-6,SHAW>We'll take him down. It'll still be your collar.

805
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,920
<20-7,BECKETT>她居然是位母亲  我真是没想到
<20-7,BECKETT>Wow. She's a mom. I never would've pegged her for that.

806
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,090
<20-7,BECKETT>我本以为她是个没时间顾家的工作狂
<20-7,BECKETT>I figured she was a career-driven woman with no time for a family.

807
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,890
<20-8,CASTLE>不是人人都会为了工作不要家庭
<20-8,CASTLE>Well, not everybody makes that choice.

809
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,320
<20-10,MONTGOMERY>他打电话找你
<20-10,MONTGOMERY>He's calling for you.

810
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,430
<20-11,BECKETT>接过来
<20-11,BECKETT>Put him on.

811
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,030
<20-11,BECKETT>喂
<20-11,BECKETT>Hello.

812
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,570
<20-12,MAN>你自以为聪明过人是吧  妮基
<20-12,MAN>Oh, you think you're so smart, don't you, Nikki?

813
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,280
<20-12,MAN>你以为你找到我  你就赢了吗
<20-12,MAN>You think, what, just because you found me that you won?

814
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,080
<20-13,BECKETT>他知道我们到了
<20-13,BECKETT>He knows we're here.

815
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,200
<20-13,BECKETT>结束了  本  投降吧
<20-13,BECKETT>It's over, Ben. Time to give up.

816
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,330
<20-14,MAN>不  没有结束
<20-14,MAN>No, it's not over!

817
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,320
<20-15,BECKETT>本  听我说  你被包围了
<20-15,BECKETT>Ben, listen to me. You're surrounded.

818
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,020
<20-15,BECKETT>放下武器
<20-15,BECKETT>I need you to put the gun down.

819
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,250
<20-16,MAN>妮基  你知道我不会束手就擒的
<20-16,MAN>You know I can't do that, Nikki.

820
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,950
<20-17,BECKETT>本  举手投降
<20-17,BECKETT>Ben, I need you to step outside of your apartment

821
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,240
<20-17,BECKETT>走出房间
<20-17,BECKETT>with your hands raised.

822
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,750
<20-18,MAN>游戏不是这样玩的  你我中必死一人
<20-18,MAN>That's not our game. One of us has to die.

823
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,510
<20-19,BECKETT>没人必须要死
<20-19,BECKETT>No one has to die.

824
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,890
<20-20,MAN>总有人必须要死
<20-20,MAN>Somebody always has to die!

825
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,100
<20-20,MAN>既然死的不是你
<20-20,MAN>And since it can't be you...

826
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,710
<20-21,BECKETT>本
<20-21,BECKETT>Ben.

827
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,580
<20-23,MAN>冲
<20-23,MAN>Go!

828
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,870
<20-24,MAN>快  快  快
<20-24,MAN>Go! Go! Go!

829
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,830
<20-26,MAN>厨房没人
<20-26,MAN>Kitchen's clear!

830
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,340
<20-26,MAN>浴室没人
<20-26,MAN>Bathroom's clear!

831
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,810
<21-1,SHAW>我们会做弹道检测
<21-1,SHAW>We're sending the gun to ballistics,

832
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,810
<21-1,SHAW>这枪是点45口径的  很可能就是
<21-1,SHAW>but given it's a .45, it's probably the same one

833
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:06,980
<21-1,SHAW>他作案的凶器
<21-1,SHAW>he used on our other victims.

834
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,950
<21-2,CASTLE>很可能就是准备用来杀你的凶器
<21-2,CASTLE>And probably the same one he was gonna use on you.

835
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,750
<21-3,SHAW>其实  不是的
<21-3,SHAW>Uh, actually, no.

836
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,750
<21-3,SHAW>他有个更轰轰烈烈的计划
<21-3,SHAW>He was planning something a little bit more spectacular.

837
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,760
<21-4,CASTLE>电话
<21-4,CASTLE>Cell phones?

838
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,970
<21-5,BECKETT>他在做引爆装置
<21-5,BECKETT>He was making a detonator.

839
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,110
<21-6,MALE VOICE IN THE PHONE>永别了  妮基  永别了  妮基
<21-6,MALE VOICE IN THE PHONE>Good-bye, Nikki. Good-bye, Nikki.

840
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,040
<21-7,SHAW>他从偷来的防腐液中
<21-7,SHAW>He was extracting formaldehyde

841
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,140
<21-7,SHAW>提取甲醛就是要制造旋风炸药
<21-7,SHAW>from the embalming fluid he stole to create cyclonite--

842
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,140
<21-7,SHAW>一种近似军用的烈性炸药
<21-7,SHAW>a near military-grade explosive.

843
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,940
<21-8,CASTLE>你分析他时  说他很可能是个纵火犯
<21-8,CASTLE>When you profiled him, you said he was probably an arsonist.

844
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,810
<21-9,SHAW>我也说了他喜欢搞出大场面
<21-9,SHAW>I also said he liked to make a big scene.

845
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,010
<21-9,SHAW>警局内部构造分析图
<21-9,SHAW>Schematics of the precinct.

846
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,450
<21-9,SHAW>他想干掉你
<21-9,SHAW>He was planning on killing you

847
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,040
<21-9,SHAW>整个警局也一起埋葬
<21-9,SHAW>and taking the whole station with you.

848
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,450
<21-10,CASTLE>"妮基将葬身火海"  还挺有诗意的
<21-10,CASTLE>"Nikki will burn." I can see the poetry in that.

849
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,560
<21-10,CASTLE>十恶不赦  嗜杀成魔的罪恶诗篇
<21-10,CASTLE>The terrible, homicidal poetry.

850
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,130
<21-11,SHAW>我只是没料到他会自杀
<21-11,SHAW>I just wouldn't have profiled this guy as suicidal.

851
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,130
<21-11,SHAW>可能一旦我们发现了他
<21-11,SHAW>I guess once we found him,

852
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,960
<21-11,SHAW>自杀就成了他能掌控局势的唯一方式
<21-11,SHAW>it was the only way he could control the situation.

853
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,760
<21-12,BECKETT>至少康纳德自杀让我们免去了种种麻烦
<21-12,BECKETT>Well, at least Conrad saved us the trouble of a trial.

854
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,530
<21-13,SHAW>值得庆贺的是  我不在你眼前晃来晃去了
<21-13,SHAW>And the best news is, I'm out of your hair.

855
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,040
<21-14,BECKETT>值得庆贺的是
<21-14,BECKETT>The best news...

856
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,180
<21-14,BECKETT>这案子结了
<21-14,BECKETT>is that it's over.

857
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,200
<22-1,CASTLE>我以为你一小时前就睡了
<22-1,CASTLE>I thought you went to bed an hour ago.

858
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,890
<22-2,ALEXIS>我睡不着
<22-2,ALEXIS>I couldn't sleep.

859
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,460
<22-2,ALEXIS>这案子不是结了吗
<22-2,ALEXIS>I thought the case was over.

860
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,610
<22-3,CASTLE>是的  干净漂亮地结了
<22-3,CASTLE>Oh, it is. Wrapped up all nice and neat.

861
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,520
<22-4,ALEXIS>这是好事  是吧
<22-4,ALEXIS>That's a good thing, right?

862
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,130
<22-5,CASTLE>在书里  是好事
<22-5,CASTLE>In a book, that's a good thing.

863
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,100
<22-5,CASTLE>但现实生活中  没有什么能这么利落地解决
<22-5,CASTLE>In real life, nothing is that neat.

864
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,260
<22-5,CASTLE>谁让你辗转反侧了
<22-5,CASTLE>What's got you still up?

865
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,080
<22-5,CASTLE>奶奶
<22-5,CASTLE>Gram.

866
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,390
<22-6,ALEXIS>我真不敢相信她明天就要走了
<22-6,ALEXIS>I can't believe she's leaving tomorrow.

867
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,990
<22-6,ALEXIS>的确  她刚搬进来时
<22-6,ALEXIS>I mean, yeah, when she first moved in,

868
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,570
<22-6,ALEXIS>我无法想象她时刻都在我身边的景象
<22-6,ALEXIS>I couldn't imagine having her around all the time.

869
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,530
<22-6,ALEXIS>但现在我...  无法想象她离开后会怎样
<22-6,ALEXIS>But now I... can't imagine her being gone.

870
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,490
<22-6,ALEXIS>听着
<22-6,ALEXIS>Listen...

871
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,200
<22-7,CASTLE>这就是生活
<22-7,CASTLE>It's a fact of life.

872
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,960
<22-7,CASTLE>我们所爱的人总会离开我们
<22-7,CASTLE>People we love leave us.

873
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,130
<22-7,CASTLE>除非你把他们铐在暖气片上
<22-7,CASTLE>Unless you chain 'em to a radiator,

874
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,770
<22-7,CASTLE>而出于某种原因  这属于非法行为
<22-7,CASTLE>which for some reason is illegal.

875
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,790
<22-9,CASTLE>但是  凭我对她的了解
<22-9,CASTLE>But, uh... knowing her...

876
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,680
<22-9,CASTLE>她半年内一定会搬回来的
<22-9,CASTLE>she'll be back in six months.

877
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,350
<22-10,MARTHA>太好了  你们都没睡
<22-10,MARTHA>Oh, good. You're both up.

878
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,880
<22-10,MARTHA>亲爱的  你得来帮我决定下该搬些什么
<22-10,MARTHA>Darling, I need you to help me decide on what to take.

879
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,120
<22-10,MARTHA>我得把箱子搬下来
<22-10,MARTHA>Oh, and I need to get my bags down.

880
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,050
<22-10,MARTHA>理查德  能搭把手吗
<22-10,MARTHA>Richard, could you give us a hand?

881
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,660
<22-11,CASTLE>手
<22-11,CASTLE>A hand.

882
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,920
<22-12,ALEXIS>怎么了
<22-12,ALEXIS>What?

883
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,820
<22-13,CASTLE>第二个受害者身上的淤痕
<22-13,CASTLE>The bruising pattern on the second victim--

884
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,690
<22-13,CASTLE>显示凶手用的是左手
<22-13,CASTLE>the killer used his left hand.

885
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,050
<22-13,CASTLE>还有  看看他的字迹
<22-13,CASTLE>And... you see his handwriting?

886
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,970
<22-13,CASTLE>看"4"的倾斜度和"6"圈的写法
<22-13,CASTLE>Look at the slope on the "4" And the loop on the "6."

887
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,070
<22-14,MARTHA>没错  这么说他是左撇子
<22-14,MARTHA>Yeah. So he was left-handed.

888
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,640
<22-15,CASTLE>本·康纳德用右手开枪自杀
<22-15,CASTLE>Well, Ben Conrad shot himself with his right hand.

889
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,010
<22-15,CASTLE>如果当时窗口那人是本·康纳德
<22-15,CASTLE>If the man in the window was Ben Conrad ,

890
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,780
<22-15,CASTLE>他就会用左手开枪自杀
<22-15,CASTLE>he would've shot himself on the left side.

891
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,280
<22-15,CASTLE>本·康纳德没有自杀
<22-15,CASTLE>Ben Conrad didn't kill himself.

892
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,060
<22-15,CASTLE>本·康纳德被当时站在窗口的人杀了
<22-15,CASTLE>Ben Conrad was murdered by the man in the window.

893
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,200
<22-15,CASTLE>本  本不是凶手
<22-15,CASTLE>Ben--Ben's not our killer.

894
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,790
<22-15,CASTLE>-真正的凶手只是在耍我们  -但有证据...
<22-15,CASTLE>- The real killer was just playing with us. - But the evidence--

895
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,790
<22-17,CASTLE>这只是凶手设的套  让我们以为本是凶手
<22-17,CASTLE>No, it was--it was planted there to lead us to Ben.

896
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,090
<22-17,CASTLE>他想让我们以为案子结了
<22-17,CASTLE>He wants us to think it's over.

897
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,090
<22-17,CASTLE>他想让我们放松警惕
<22-17,CASTLE>He wants us to drop our guard.

898
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,260
<22-17,CASTLE>他要制造大场面
<22-17,CASTLE>He wants to make a big scene.

899
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,030
<22-17,CASTLE>"妮基将葬身火海"
<22-17,CASTLE>"Nikki will burn."

901
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,080
<22-18,MARTHA>天哪
<22-18,MARTHA>Oh, God.

902
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,210

<22-19,CASTLE>Montgomery took the detail off her place. She's alone.

903
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,280
<23-1,CASTLE>她没接  打给警局
<23-1,CASTLE>She's not picking up. Call the precinct.

<23-1,CASTLE>叫增援立刻到她家
<23-1,CASTLE>Tell them to get over there right away.

<23-1,CASTLE>通知警局我们错了  凶手还没死
<23-1,CASTLE>Tell them we were wrong. Tell them the killer's still alive.

<23-1,CASTLE>You lock this door behind me. Don't let anyone in.
