<10-1,CASTLE>Wow. The camera really does add 10 pounds...

68
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,680
<10-2,BECKETT>尤其是自信心
<10-2,BECKETT>to his ego.

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,650
<10-3,CASTLE>如果有位美丽的电影女星

<11-2,MARTHA>I always wonder what

80
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,020
<11-2,MARTHA>靠过去的时候都说些什么
<11-2,MARTHA>they're saying when they lean in like that.

<15-1,CASTLE>你是去参加定向越野  不是去图书馆
<15-1,CASTLE>Um... you're going orienteering not librarying.

92
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,130
<15-1,CASTLE>你觉得有必要带那么多书吗
<15-1,CASTLE>You sure you want to take that many books?

93
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,300
<15-2,ALEXIS>对于五天的行程来说太多了吗
<15-2,ALEXIS>Overambitious for a 5-day trip?

94
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,860
<15-3,CASTLE>到时候你的行李可是要你自己背着
<15-3,CASTLE>You're gonna be responsible for your own pack.

95
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,620
<15-3,CASTLE>你应该学学莎卡嘉薇亚[印第安女探险家]
<15-3,CASTLE>I think you're supposed to be more Sacagawea

96
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,100
<15-3,CASTLE>而不是一副文人学者的样子
<15-3,CASTLE>than a scholarly reader.

97
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,830
<15-3,CASTLE>再说了  你看看这么多的纸张
<15-3,CASTLE>Besides, look at all those pages,

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,130
<15-3,CASTLE>-树木们会找你报仇的  -理查德
<15-3,CASTLE>- the trees might want revenge. - Richard.

99
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,190
<15-5,CASTLE>怎么了
<15-5,CASTLE>What's wrong?

100
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,230
<15-6,MARTHA>鲍比·曼死了
<15-6,MARTHA>Bobby Mann is dead.

101
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,010
<15-7,CASTLE>什么  出什么事了
<15-7,CASTLE>What? What happened?

102
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,020
<15-8,MARTHA>据说他是心脏病发作
<15-8,MARTHA>They're saying he had a heart attack.

103
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,810
<16-1,CASTLE>我告诉你
<16-1,CASTLE>I'm telling you, the guy

104
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,400
<16-1,CASTLE>他说有人想置他于死地
<16-1,CASTLE>said that somebody wanted him dead,

105
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,890
<16-1,CASTLE>结果他就真的死了
<16-1,CASTLE>and then he ends up dead.

106
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,880
<16-1,CASTLE>这绝不仅仅是个巧合
<16-1,CASTLE>That can't be a coincidence.

107
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,830
<16-2,BECKETT>鲍比·曼有心脏病史
<16-2,BECKETT>Bobby Mann had a history of heart disease,

108
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,220
<16-2,BECKETT>再说了  验尸报告证实
<16-2,BECKETT>and on the autopsy reports,

109
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,310
<16-2,BECKETT>他的死亡确实是心脏病发所致
<16-2,BECKETT>it states that the cause of death was a heart attack.

110
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,830
<16-2,BECKETT>这也绝不会是巧合吧
<16-2,BECKETT>That can't be a coincidence either.

111
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,100
<16-3,CASTLE>是蕾妮验的尸吗
<16-3,CASTLE>Did Lanie do the autopsy?

112
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,650
<16-4,BECKETT>不是  但是她把报告寄过来了
<16-4,BECKETT>No, but she sent it to me.

113
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,790
<16-4,BECKETT>有个人在遛狗时
<16-4,BECKETT>Okay, a guy was walking his dog,

114
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,640
<16-4,BECKETT>看到曼一个人瘫倒在人行道上
<16-4,BECKETT>saw Mr. Mann collapse on the sidewalk alone.

115
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,060
<16-4,BECKETT>没有任何刺穿的伤痕  没有淤青
<16-4,BECKETT>But there's no puncture wounds, no bruising,

116
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,610
<16-4,BECKETT>而且毒性检验也一切正常
<16-4,BECKETT>and the tox panel came back negative.

117
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,100
<16-4,BECKETT>没有谋杀的迹象  卡塞尔
<16-4,BECKETT>There's no foul play, Castle.

118
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,370
<16-5,CASTLE>我今天早上和他的制片人谈了
<16-5,CASTLE>I talked to his producer this morning.

119
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,440
<16-5,CASTLE>她说曼十二点四十五的时候开着他的
<16-5,CASTLE>She said that Mann left the studio at 12:45

120
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,250
<16-5,CASTLE>布加迪威航[大众名车]离开的片场
<16-5,CASTLE>in his Bugatti Veyron.

121
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,260
<16-5,CASTLE>那车价值两百万
<16-5,CASTLE>That's a $2-million car.

122
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,630
<16-5,CASTLE>而四点五十的时候  他是在离家
<16-5,CASTLE>He collapsed on foot a few blocks

123
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,300
<16-5,CASTLE>-几个街区的地方步行时瘫倒的  -那又怎样
<16-5,CASTLE>- from his house at 4:50. - So?

124
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,090
<16-7,CASTLE>那车去哪儿了
<16-7,CASTLE>So where's the car?

125
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,340
<16-8,BECKETT>他可是个亿万富翁  卡塞尔
<16-8,BECKETT>He's, like, a gazillionaire, Castle.

126
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,890
<16-8,BECKETT>他说不定就是把车停在某个地方
<16-8,BECKETT>He probably just parked it and

127
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,230
<16-8,BECKETT>然后等别人第二天早上把车取回来
<16-8,BECKETT>expected someone else to pick it up the next morning.

128
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,380
<16-9,CASTLE>在我那本《斯道姆集结》里  那位前任克格勃
<16-9,CASTLE>In my book "Gathering storm", the former KGB official

129
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,080
<16-9,CASTLE>就是被一种检测不到的毒药杀死的
<16-9,CASTLE>killed with an undetectable poison

130
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,490
<16-9,CASTLE>导致心脏骤停的毒药
<16-9,CASTLE>that stopped the heart.

131
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,930
<16-9,CASTLE>说不定这事就发生在曼身上呢
<16-9,CASTLE>What if that's what happened to Mann?

132
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,840
<16-10,BECKETT>需要提醒你  你是依靠编造故事为生的
<16-10,BECKETT>Need I remind you that you make up stuff for a living,

133
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,190
<16-10,BECKETT>现实中根本没有这种毒药
<16-10,BECKETT>and there is no such poison in real life,

134
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,240
<16-10,BECKETT>如果真有这东西  那恐怕会有无数
<16-10,BECKETT>and if there was, there would be a whole slew

135
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,640
<16-10,BECKETT>愤怒的小夫妻可以逃过谋杀的罪名了
<16-10,BECKETT>of angry spouses who'd be getting away with murder?

136
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,140
<16-11,CASTLE>你就不能让蕾妮再仔细验一遍吗
<16-11,CASTLE>Could you just have Lanie take a closer look?

137
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,650
<16-11,CASTLE>求你了
<16-11,CASTLE>Please.

138
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,010
<17-1,LANIE>你知道我为了这事
<17-1,LANIE>You know how many strings

139
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,870
<17-1,LANIE>动用了多少私人关系吗  卡塞尔
<17-1,LANIE>I had to pull for this, Castle?

140
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,590
<17-2,CASTLE>如果我猜错了  我会为这个城市做出补偿
<17-2,CASTLE>If I'm wrong, I'll reimburse the city.

141
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,970
<17-3,LANIE>关这个城市鬼事  你亏欠的是我
<17-3,LANIE>To hell with the city. It's me you're gonna owe.

142
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,130
<17-3,LANIE>你可以用水疗消费券  珠宝或者现金来补偿我
<17-3,LANIE>I take spa certificates, jewelry and cash.

143
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,270
<17-4,CASTLE>遵命  那是什么
<17-4,CASTLE>Duly noted. What's that?

144
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,360
<17-5,LANIE>鲍比·曼被送过来的时候
<17-5,LANIE>The contents of Bobby Mann's pockets

145
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,050
<17-5,LANIE>口袋里的东西
<17-5,LANIE>when he was brought in.

146
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,770
<17-5,LANIE>我去看看化验室有什么结果
<17-5,LANIE>I'm gonna a go check on the labs.

147
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,570
<17-5,LANIE>好的
<17-5,LANIE>Okay.

148
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,100
<17-6,BECKETT>你干嘛呢
<17-6,BECKETT>What are you doing?

149
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,150
<17-7,CASTLE>这叫调查取证  你有空也该试试
<17-7,CASTLE>It's called investigating. You should try it.

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,140
<17-8,BECKETT>我通常只在有案子的时候才做这事
<17-8,BECKETT>I usually wait until there's a crime.

151
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,860
<17-9,CASTLE>手机  钱夹
<17-9,CASTLE>Cell phone, money clip.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,470
<17-9,CASTLE>他先用张纸包住了口香糖
<17-9,CASTLE>He stuck a piece of gum to a paper

153
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,830
<17-9,CASTLE>才放进了口袋里
<17-9,CASTLE>before he put it in his pocket.

154
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,050
<17-10,BECKETT>这证明他死前没有乱扔垃圾
<17-10,BECKETT>One of his last acts was not littering.

155
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,460
<17-11,CASTLE>没错  但是这张纸上有一个词--"TORY"
<17-11,CASTLE>Yes, but there's a word on this paper--"TORY."

156
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,280
<17-11,CASTLE>说不定是个神秘女子呢
<17-11,CASTLE>Could be a mystery woman.

157
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,660
<17-12,BECKETT>厉害啊  卡塞尔  本案就此取得重大突破
<17-12,BECKETT>Wow, Castle. Cracking this case wide open.

158
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,570
<17-13,CASTLE>看这个  他的随手笔记
<17-13,CASTLE>Hey, it's his idea notepad.

159
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,330
<17-13,CASTLE>这是他昨晚说的那个笑话
<17-13,CASTLE>This is a joke from last night.

160
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,800
<17-13,CASTLE>"慈善高尔夫  他第一次抽身"
<17-13,CASTLE>"Charity golf. First time he's pulled out in years."

161
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,410
<17-14,BECKETT>你有没有意识到你正在调查的
<17-14,BECKETT>Do you realize that you are

162
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,660
<17-14,BECKETT>只是一次心脏病发作啊
<17-14,BECKETT>now investigating a heart attack?

163
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,220
<17-15,CASTLE>怎么了
<17-15,CASTLE>What?

164
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,870
<17-16,BECKETT>二十年来他的招牌台词
<17-16,BECKETT>His signature line of 20 years,

165
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,630
<17-16,BECKETT>"魅力男生  欢乐相约明晚"
<17-16,BECKETT>"The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night,"

166
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,380
<17-17,CASTLE>看上去他是想改一改这句话了
<17-17,CASTLE>looks like he was thinking of changing it.

167
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,160
<17-18,BECKETT>"亲密团队  欢乐相约明晚"
<17-18,BECKETT>"The crew will be back on duty tomorrow night."

168
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
<17-19,CASTLE>也许他只是想把话说的时髦点儿
<17-19,CASTLE>Maybe he was trying to make it hipper.

169
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,200
<17-21,CASTLE>咱们也该弄一句招牌台词
<17-21,CASTLE>We should have a signature line.

170
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,510
<17-21,CASTLE>"她全副武装  他散播恐慌"
<17-21,CASTLE>She's armed, he's dangerous.

171
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,660
<17-23,CASTLE>-不要  -不要  那就
<17-23,CASTLE>- No. - No. How about

172
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,130
<17-23,CASTLE>"罪案终结的崭新篇章"
<17-23,CASTLE>a whole new chapter in crime solving?

173
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,480
<17-25,CASTLE>-"篇章"  有深度吧  -没有
<17-25,CASTLE>- Chapter. Get it? - No.

174
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,840
<17-26,BECKETT>我把所有标准规定以外的
<17-26,BECKETT>Okay, I ran every extra tox screen

175
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,640
<17-27,LANIE>毒性化验都做了一遍
<17-27,LANIE>outside of standard protocol.

176
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,050
<17-27,LANIE>全是阴性  没有任何已知有毒物质的痕迹
<17-27,LANIE>All negative, no trace of any known poisonous substance.

177
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,710
<17-28,BECKETT>听到啦  卡塞尔
<17-28,BECKETT>Okay, Castle?

178
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,130
<17-28,BECKETT>出门时别忘了给法医小费哦
<17-28,BECKETT>Don't forget to tip your M.E. on the way out.

179
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,510
<17-29,LANIE>先别急着走
<17-29,LANIE>Ah, not so fast.

180
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,210
<17-29,LANIE>第二次毒性检验检测到了酪胺的成分
<17-29,LANIE>Secondary tox panel detected traces of tyramine,

181
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,850
<17-29,LANIE>它本身对人体是无害的
<17-29,LANIE>which is harmless,

182
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,880
<17-29,LANIE>但它的存在让我提高了警觉
<17-29,LANIE>but it's presence raised a red flag for me.

183
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,410
<17-29,LANIE>于是我又多做了一些化验
<17-29,LANIE>So I ran some more tests.

184
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,960
<17-29,LANIE>-鲍比·曼在服用苯乙肼  -苯乙肼
<17-29,LANIE>- Bobby Mann was taking phenelzine. - Phenelzine?

185
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,290
<17-31,LANIE>-一种抗抑郁处方药  -也就是说?
<17-31,LANIE>- A prescription drug for depression. - So?

186
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,630
<17-32,BECKETT>苯乙肼是属于一种
<17-32,BECKETT>So phenelzine is in a class of drugs

187
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,930
<17-33,LANIE>军方管制类药物
<17-33,LANIE>called M.A.O. Inhibitors

188
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,480
<17-33,LANIE>有着很严格的服用禁忌
<17-33,LANIE>that have powerful contra-indicators.

189
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,310
<17-34,BECKETT>你是说食物与药物互相冲突
<17-34,BECKETT>You mean drug interactions?

190
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,840
<17-35,LANIE>这种冲突是可以致命的
<17-35,LANIE>In this case, interactions that can kill.

191
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,440
<17-35,LANIE>军方管制类药物不能和任何
<17-35,LANIE>M.A.O. Inhibitors contra-indicate with

192
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,860
<17-35,LANIE>发酵过的东西同时服用  红酒  啤酒
<17-35,LANIE>anything fermented-- wine, beer,

193
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,160
<17-35,LANIE>还有特定种类的奶酪
<17-35,LANIE>certain kind of cheeses.

194
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,270
<17-35,LANIE>即使是很小的含量也会引发血压骤升
<17-35,LANIE>Even the smallest amount can trigger a hypertensive crisis.

195
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,850
<17-36,CASTLE>这不和那种无法检测的
<17-36,CASTLE>Oh! Almost like an undetectable

196
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,980
<17-36,CASTLE>导致心脏骤停的毒药差不多嘛
<17-36,CASTLE>poison that stops the heart.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,520
<17-37,BECKETT>这又不能说明他是被谋杀的
<17-37,BECKETT>Which doesn't mean that he was murdered.

198
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,350
<17-37,BECKETT>他说不定只是不小心吃了或者喝了
<17-37,BECKETT>He could've accidentally eaten or drank something

199
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,200
<17-37,BECKETT>某些他不该碰的东西
<17-37,BECKETT>he shouldn't have.

200
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,740
<17-38,LANIE>我也是这么想的
<17-38,LANIE>That's what I thought.

201
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,160
<17-38,LANIE>所以我检测了一下他的肠道残余物
<17-38,LANIE>So I ran the contents of his intestines.

202
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,550
<17-38,LANIE>在他死前的几小时
<17-38,LANIE>In the hours prior to his death,

203
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,340
<17-38,LANIE>他摄入了三种物质
<17-38,LANIE>he ingested three substances--

204
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,190
<17-39,CASTLE>-某种甜食  比如说糖块  -或者口香糖
<17-39,CASTLE>- Something sugary, like hard candy... - Or chewing gum.

205
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,160
<17-40,LANIE>没错
<17-40,LANIE>There you go.

206
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,930
<17-40,LANIE>还发现有蔓越莓汁和甜醋
<17-40,LANIE>Also cranberry juice and balsamic vinegar.

207
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,620
<17-41,CASTLE>甜醋是经过发酵的
<17-41,CASTLE>Which is fermented.

208
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,330
<17-42,LANIE>而且除此以外没有任何可能添加了
<17-42,LANIE>And there was no trace of anything

209
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,920
<17-42,LANIE>甜醋的食物残余
<17-42,LANIE>that you would find balsamic on--

210
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,580
<17-42,LANIE>没有鸡肉  没有鱼肉  没有意粉
<17-42,LANIE>No chicken, no fish, no pasta.

211
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,950
<17-42,LANIE>只可能是蔓越莓汁
<17-42,LANIE>Just the cranberry juice.

212
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,750
<17-43,CASTLE>蔓越莓汁可以轻易掩盖掉
<17-43,CASTLE>Which could've easily masked the color

213
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,200
<17-43,CASTLE>甜醋的颜色和气味
<17-43,CASTLE>and the taste of the balsamic vinegar.

214
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,910
<17-44,BECKETT>你的意思是
<17-44,BECKETT>So you're saying

215
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,900
<17-44,BECKETT>有人知道鲍比·曼的饮食禁忌
<17-44,BECKETT>that somebody knew about Bobby Mann's condition,

216
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,820
<17-44,BECKETT>在他的蔓越莓汁里偷偷加了甜醋
<17-44,BECKETT>slipped balsamic vinegar into his cranberry juice,

217
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,160
<17-44,BECKETT>并且知道这会置他于死地
<17-44,BECKETT>knowing that it would kill him?

218
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,820
<17-45,LANIE>这绝非意外  鲍比·曼是被谋杀的
<17-45,LANIE>This was no accident. Bobby Mann was murdered.

219
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,450
<17-46,CASTLE>鲍比  你说的果然没错
<17-46,CASTLE>Well, Bobby, you were right.

226
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,130
<18-1,CASTLE>没有犯罪现场  没有明确的位置
<18-1,CASTLE>No crime scene, no clear place

227
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,460
<18-1,CASTLE>来展开调查
<18-1,CASTLE>to begin the investigation.

228
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,640
<18-1,CASTLE>你说投毒案是不是太有意思了
<18-1,CASTLE>Don't you just love poisonings?

229
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,350
<18-2,BECKETT>尤其是这种没有毒药的投毒案
<18-2,BECKETT>Especially a poisoning without poison.

230
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,820
<18-2,BECKETT>这个凶手十分聪明
<18-2,BECKETT>Whoever did this was very smart.

231
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,710
<18-2,BECKETT>他所用的凶器几乎可以在
<18-2,BECKETT>He chose a murder weapon that's probably

232
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,380
<18-2,BECKETT>城里一半的厨房里找到
<18-2,BECKETT>in half the kitchens in the city.

233
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,480
<18-3,CASTLE>好在咱们也够聪明
<18-3,CASTLE>Good thing we're smart, too.

234
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,060
<18-4,ESPOSITO>谢谢  蕾妮的电话
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Thanks. That was Lanie.

235
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,090
<18-4,ESPOSITO>根据军方管制药物与食物冲突的致命程度
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Based on possible rates of fatal M.A.O.I. interactions,

236
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,030
<18-4,ESPOSITO>她可以把下毒时间范围缩小到
<18-4,ESPOSITO>she was able to narrow the window of poisoning down

237
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,240
<18-4,ESPOSITO>凌晨一点半到四点半之间
<18-4,ESPOSITO>between 1:30 and 4:30 in the morning.

238
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,270
<18-5,BECKETT>也就是说...
<18-5,BECKETT>That makes...

239
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,410
<18-5,BECKETT>这里
<18-5,BECKETT>this...

240
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,530
<18-5,BECKETT>就是投毒时间区
<18-5,BECKETT>our kill zone--

241
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,040
<18-5,BECKETT>一点半到四点半
<18-5,BECKETT>1:30 to 4:30

242
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,210
<18-5,BECKETT>还有什么
<18-5,BECKETT>What else?

243
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,510
<18-6,ESPOSITO>化验室说曼口袋里的
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Well, the lab said that

244
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,550
<18-6,ESPOSITO>口香糖上没有任何
<18-6,ESPOSITO>there was no traces of cranberry juice

245
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,260
<18-6,ESPOSITO>蔓越莓汁或者甜醋的成分
<18-6,ESPOSITO>or balsamic vinegar in the gum we found in Mann's pocket.

246
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,090
<18-6,ESPOSITO>所以他一定是在被投毒前吃的口香糖
<18-6,ESPOSITO>So he must have chewed that before he was poisoned.

247
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,220
<18-7,CASTLE>我们知道他是在十二点四十五离开片场的
<18-7,CASTLE>Well, we know he left the studio at 12:45.

248
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,850
<18-8,ESPOSITO>也就是说他不是在那里被下毒的
<18-8,ESPOSITO>Which means he wasn't poisoned there.

249
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,700
<18-9,BECKETT>我们还知道他家里的安全监控录像显示
<18-9,BECKETT>And we know that his home security records

250
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,270
<18-9,BECKETT>他一直没有回去过
<18-9,BECKETT>show that he never made it there.

251
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,130
<18-10,CASTLE>凌晨十二点四十五到四点五十
<18-10,CASTLE>12:45 to 4:50 in the morning,

252
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,390
<18-10,CASTLE>开着车走的  被发现时却是步行的
<18-10,CASTLE>leaves in his car, is found on foot.

253
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,370
<18-10,CASTLE>那么他在这段时间里干什么去了
<18-10,CASTLE>So what was he doing that whole time?

254
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,990
<18-11,RYAN>另外  曼跑车里的
<18-11,RYAN>So the vehicle locator

255
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,070
<18-11,RYAN>车载定位器没有发出任何信号
<18-11,RYAN>in Mann's Bugatti is not sending a signal.

256
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,750
<18-12,ESPOSITO>也许是在某个地下停车场
<18-12,ESPOSITO>Probably in an underground parking garage.

257
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,940
<18-13,BECKETT>也就是说车可能在任何地方
<18-13,BECKETT>Which means it could be anywhere.

258
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,510
<18-13,BECKETT>查一下他的手机
<18-13,BECKETT>Check his cell phone,

259
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,030
<18-13,BECKETT>看他昨晚有没有打过任何电话
<18-13,BECKETT>see if he made any calls last night,

260
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,850
<18-13,BECKETT>然后再去他的豪宅看看
<18-13,BECKETT>and then go to his brownstone.

261
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,030
<18-13,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔
<18-13,BECKETT>Castle and I will head

262
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,030
<18-13,BECKETT>去片场看看有没有什么线索
<18-13,BECKETT>to the studio and see what we can dig up there.

263
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,570
<18-14,ESPOSITO>-还有  -什么
<18-14,ESPOSITO>- Oh, guys. - Yeah.

264
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,850
<18-15,BECKETT>别提到谋杀二字
<18-15,BECKETT>No talk of murder.

265
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,330
<18-15,BECKETT>咱们对媒体瞒得越久
<18-15,BECKETT>The longer we can keep this

266
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,670
<18-15,BECKETT>调查就可以进行地更顺利
<18-15,BECKETT>away from the press, the better off we'll be.

267
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,140
<18-15,BECKETT>很抱歉
<18-15,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

268
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,550
<18-15,BECKETT>我真不知道他昨晚节目结束以后去哪了
<18-15,BECKETT>I don't know where he went after the show last night.

269
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,500
<18-15,BECKETT>你们问这个干嘛
<18-15,BECKETT>What is this about anyway?

270
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,380
<18-15,BECKETT>我以为鲍比
<18-15,BECKETT>I thought Bobby...

271
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,410
<18-15,BECKETT>是死于心脏病发作
<18-15,BECKETT>died of a heart attack, right?

272
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,530
<19-1,BECKETT>我们只是在帮验尸官收集一些遗漏的信息
<19-1,BECKETT>We're just tying up loose ends for the coroner.

273
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,170
<19-2,CASTLE>曼先生最近状态如何
<19-2,CASTLE>How was Mr. Mann acting recently?

274
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,460
<19-2,CASTLE>你有发现什么异常吗
<19-2,CASTLE>Did you notice anything unusual?

275
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,300
<19-2,CASTLE>没有  他很好
<19-2,CASTLE>No. He was great.

276
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,930
<19-3,BECKETT>除了昨天
<19-3,BECKETT>Uh... except yesterday.

277
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,820
<19-3,BECKETT>-昨天发生什么了  -我也不知道
<19-3,BECKETT>- What happened yesterday? - I don't know.

278
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,610
<19-3,BECKETT>他整个早晨都把自己锁在办公室里
<19-3,BECKETT>I mean, he spent the morning locked up in his office alone.

279
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,470
<19-4,BECKETT>剩下的时间他都很焦虑不安
<19-4,BECKETT>And then the rest of the day, he was agitated

280
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,190
<19-4,BECKETT>而且表现地很奇怪
<19-4,BECKETT>and he was acting weird.

281
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,560
<19-4,BECKETT>-怎么个奇怪法  -疑心重重的
<19-4,BECKETT>- Weird how? - Paranoid.

282
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,920
<22-7,BARBARA>他还问我有没有听到什么传言
<22-7,BARBARA>At one point he asked me if I had heard anything,

283
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,850
<19-7,BECKETT>我问他关于什么的  他只是耸了耸肩
<19-7,BECKETT>and I said, "About what?" And he just shrugged it off.

284
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,840
<19-5,BECKETT>你有注意到他在服用强效抗抑郁药吗
<19-5,BECKETT>Were you aware that he was on powerful antidepressants?

285
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,820
<19-5,BECKETT>说实话  这件事上他很注重隐私
<19-5,BECKETT>I mean, he tried to be very private about it,

286
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,040
<19-6,CASTLE>但他服药期间  必须得戒酒
<19-6,CASTLE>but when he went on them, he had to quit drinking,

287
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,490
<19-6,CASTLE>于是大家都很好奇
<19-6,CASTLE>and people wondered why.

288
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,900
<19-6,CASTLE>所以事情就传开了
<19-6,CASTLE>So word got around.

289
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,930
<19-6,CASTLE>你不会认为他是因为这个被害的吧
<19-6,CASTLE>You don't think that's what killed him, do you?

290
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,620
<19-6,CASTLE>吃了什么东西  或者喝了什么
<19-6,CASTLE>Something he ate or-- or drank?

291
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,070
<19-7,BECKETT>他很谨慎的
<19-7,BECKETT>He was very careful.

292
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,940
<19-7,BECKETT>如我之前所说  我们只是跟进一下
<19-7,BECKETT>Like I said, we're just following up.

293
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,320
<19-7,BECKETT>我总是望向帷幕的那一端  知道吗
<19-7,BECKETT>I keep looking over at that curtain, you know,

294
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,730
<19-8,HANK>等着他从那走过来
<19-8,HANK>waiting for him to walk through...

295
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,730
<19-8,HANK>就好像这一切不过是个宣传噱头
<19-8,HANK>like this was all one big publicity stunt.

296
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,330
<19-9,CASTLE>你们两个关系很好  是吗
<19-9,CASTLE>The two of you were close, right?

297
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,740
<19-9,CASTLE>很久之前就是好朋友
<19-9,CASTLE>Since before all this.

298
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,170
<19-10,HANK>那时是在越南  我们都还很年轻
<19-10,HANK>Since we were just kids together back in 'nam.

299
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,020
<19-11,CASTLE>就是说如果出了什么事他会告诉你
<19-11,CASTLE>So he would've told you if there was anything wrong?

300
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,350
<19-12,HANK>出什么事
<19-12,HANK>Like what?

301
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,140
<19-13,CASTLE>比如说他担心他的身体和精神状况
<19-13,CASTLE>Like if he was concerned for his well-being.

302
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,100
<19-14,HANK>为什么问这些
<19-14,HANK>What's this all about?

303
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,990
<19-14,HANK>我以为他是死于心脏病发作
<19-14,HANK>I-I thought he died of a heart attack.

304
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
<19-15,BECKETT>只是一些例行问话  迈克菲先生
<19-15,BECKETT>Just routine questioning, Mr McPhee.

305
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,590
<19-15,BECKETT>对了  有人说最近他显得有点
<19-15,BECKETT>You know, some of the people said that he seemed

306
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,650
<19-15,BECKETT>坐立不安
<19-15,BECKETT>a little agitated recently.

307
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,690
<19-16,HANK>你这么一说  他是有些心事重重
<19-16,HANK>Come to think of it, he was a little preoccupied.

308
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,350
<19-16,HANK>昨晚节目结束之后我问他怎么了
<19-16,HANK>I asked him about it after the show last night,

309
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,900
<19-16,HANK>但是他坚持说他很好
<19-16,HANK>but he insisted he was fine.

310
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,030
<19-17,MICKEY REED>汉克
<19-17,MICKEY REED>Hank.

311
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,730
<19-17,MICKEY REED>老伙计  我很抱歉
<19-17,MICKEY REED>Man, I am so sorry.

312
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,030
<19-17,MICKEY REED>噩梦的确是会发生的
<19-17,MICKEY REED>Nightmares really happen. Huh?

313
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,950
<19-18,HANK>是啊  你认识米基吗
<19-18,HANK>Yeah. You know Mickey--

314
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,120
<19-18,HANK>《深夜脱口秀》的主持人  在我们节目之后播出
<19-18,HANK>host of "Late Talk", right after our show?

315
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,710
<19-19,CASTLE>当然认识  很喜欢你的节目
<19-19,CASTLE>Yes, of course. I'm a big fan.

316
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,210
<19-19,CASTLE>我很喜欢战利品轮盘赌那个板块
<19-19,CASTLE>I love your whole "Booty Roulette" gag.

317
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,560
<19-19,CASTLE>-真是不错  我是里克  -卡塞尔
<19-19,CASTLE>- That's great. I'm Rick. - Castle.

318
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,220
<19-20,MICKEY>是的  昨晚看到你上节目了
<19-20,MICKEY>Yeah. Saw you on the show last night.

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,100
<19-21,BECKETT>-我是凯特·贝克特探长  -很高兴认识你
<19-21,BECKETT>- I'm Detective Kate Beckett. - Nice to meet you.

320
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,920
<19-22,MICKEY>你们两个知道鲍比在节目结束之后
<19-22,MICKEY>So do either of you know where Bobby went

321
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,700
<19-22,MICKEY>去哪里了吗
<19-22,MICKEY>after the show last night?

322
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,520
<19-23,BECKETT>我们在为尸检报告调查他最后几个小时的行踪
<19-23,BECKETT>We're trying to track his last hours for the coroner's report.

323
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,030
<19-24,MICKEY>不知道
<19-24,MICKEY>No clue.

324
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,390
<19-25,HANK>我记得他好像提到要去见他的前妻
<19-25,HANK>I think he said something about going to see his ex-wife.

325
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,450
<19-26,CASTLE>他说去见哪个了吗
<19-26,CASTLE>Did he say which one?

326
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,280
<19-28,BECKETT>他有几个前妻啊
<19-28,BECKETT>How many ex-wives did he have?

327
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,890
<20-1,RYAN>六个  年龄在二十五岁到五十岁之间
<20-1,RYAN>6, ranging in ages from 25 to 50.

328
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,150
<20-1,RYAN>就好像是每隔五年  他就换一个更年轻的
<20-1,RYAN>It seems every five years, he traded in for the latest model.

329
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,830
<20-2,BECKETT>与其说他是娶了她们倒不如说他是租用了她们
<20-2,BECKETT>So he didn't so much marry them as lease them.

330
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,550
<20-3,RYAN>我在系统里查了这六个名字
<20-3,RYAN>So I ran all their names through the system,

331
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,000
<20-3,RYAN>猜猜谁有案底

<21-2,CINDY>大概是在一年前
<21-2,CINDY>About a year ago...

00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,340
<22-1,BARBARA>像往常一样把我吵醒
<22-1,BARBARA>woke me up as usual.

<22-3,BARBARA>before all the fame and the money.

<22-3,BARBARA>每当他感觉没有安全感的时候  他就会过来
<22-3,BARBARA>Whenever he felt insecure, he came around.

369
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,270
<22-3,BARBARA>大多是老生常谈
<22-3,BARBARA>Mostly it was the same old stuff--

373
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,630
<22-5,BARBARA>有点不对头
<22-5,BARBARA>It was different.

374
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,750
<22-5,BARBARA>他看起来像是鬼上身了似的
<22-5,BARBARA>He looked... haunted.

375
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,210
<22-5,BARBARA>他说有事情要发生
<22-5,BARBARA>He said something was going on,

376
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,250
<22-5,BARBARA>不好的事情

<22-6,BECKETT>- What was going on? - He wouldn't tell me.

378
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,270
<22-7,BARBARA>他问我是否觉得他是个好人
<22-7,BARBARA>He asked me if I thought he was a good person.

379
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,980
<22-7,BARBARA>我拉着他的手说  鲍比
<22-7,BARBARA>And I held his hand and I said, "Bobby,

380
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,260
<22-7,BARBARA>你是个糟糕的丈夫
<22-7,BARBARA>you're a lousy husband,

381
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,190
<22-7,BARBARA>但你绝对是个真男人
<22-7,BARBARA>but you're a hell of a man."

382
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,320
<22-7,BARBARA>之后他就走了
<22-7,BARBARA>Then he left.

383
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,230
<22-8,BECKETT>什么时候
<22-8,BECKETT>At what time?

384
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
<22-9,BARBARA>一点十五左右
<22-9,BARBARA>Around quarter after 1:00.

385
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,450
<22-10,CASTLE>他说他要去哪里了吗
<22-10,CASTLE>Did he say where he was going?

386
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,470
<22-10,CASTLE>没有
<22-10,CASTLE>No.

387
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,050
<22-11,BARBARA>我以为他要回家的
<22-11,BARBARA>I thought he was going home.

388
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,920
<23-1,BECKETT>有不好的事情要发生
<23-1,BECKETT>Something awful was going on.

389
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,570
<23-1,BECKETT>他知道有人要对他下毒手
<23-1,BECKETT>He knew someone was after him.

390
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,160
<23-2,CASTLE>但是他既没告诉他的前妻也没告诉他的好朋友
<23-2,CASTLE>But he doesn't tell his ex-wife or his best friend.

391
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,420
<23-2,CASTLE>反而告诉了我
<23-2,CASTLE>Instead he tells me.

392
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,790
<23-3,BECKETT>也许是因为他知道
<23-3,BECKETT>Maybe it's because he knew

393
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,080
<23-3,BECKETT>你在和警察一起工作
<23-3,BECKETT>you were working with the cops.

394
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,090
<23-3,BECKETT>告诉我  我是个好人吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Tell me I'm a good person?

395
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,270
<23-4,CASTLE>就好像他干了什么为人所耻的事情
<23-4,CASTLE>Like he was doing something he was ashamed of.

396
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,400
<23-5,BECKETT>邻居确认了芭芭拉·曼的说法
<23-5,BECKETT>Neighbors confirm Barbara Mann's story.

<23-6,RYAN>有人看到鲍比在凌晨一点十五离开她的公寓
<23-6,RYAN>One of them saw bobby leave her apartment at 1:15 a.m.

398
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,960
<23-7,BECKETT>那个时间在我们的投毒时间区之外  就是说
<23-7,BECKETT>That's outside of our kill zone, which means

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,650
<23-7,BECKETT>我们还要搞清楚他接下来去了哪里
<23-7,BECKETT>we need to figure out where he went to next.

400
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,310
<23-7,BECKETT>去查一查这个地区所有的车库
<23-7,BECKETT>Let's canvass all the garages in the area,

401
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,860
<23-7,BECKETT>看看能不能找到曼的车
<23-7,BECKETT>see if we can find Mann's car.

402
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,290
<23-7,BECKETT>还要查查他的财产情况
<23-7,BECKETT>And let's also look into his financials

403
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,850
<23-7,BECKETT>看看有没有异常  毒品  赌博和嫖娼之类的
<23-7,BECKETT>for the usual secrets-- drugs, gambling, prostitution.

404
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,670
<23-9,BECKETT>就这些
<23-9,BECKETT>Okay.

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,520
<25-11,ESPOSITO>在芭芭拉·曼居住大楼附近的车库
<25-11,ESPOSITO>Nothing at any of the garages near

438
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,610
<25-11,ESPOSITO>没有任何发现
<25-11,ESPOSITO>Barbara Mann's building.

439
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,730
<25-12,RYAN>我们询问了周围饭店的停车场
<25-12,RYAN>So we checked restaurant valets in the area.

440
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,190
<25-12,RYAN>鲍比花了一百元雇一个莫扎特餐厅的服务员
<25-12,RYAN>Bobby paid the guy at Mozart's 100 bucks

441
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,400
<25-12,RYAN>在拜访前妻的这段时间帮他看车
<25-12,RYAN>to keep it close while he ran up to his ex.

442
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,260
<25-12,RYAN>目击证人说他是在一点半之前离开的
<25-12,RYAN>Witness says he left a little before 1:30.

443
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,050
<25-13,BECKETT>六十一街和中央公园西门
<25-13,BECKETT>61st and Central Park west.

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,070
<25-13,BECKETT>之后他去了哪里
<25-13,BECKETT>Where did he go after that?

445
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,090
<25-14,ESPOSITO>也许可以查查那个地区的交通监控录像
<25-14,ESPOSITO>Maybe check traffic cams in the area.

446
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,830
<25-14,ESPOSITO>开着那种跑车的人
<25-14,ESPOSITO>A guy in a sports car like that

447
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,500
<25-14,ESPOSITO>也许会闯红灯被拍下来
<25-14,ESPOSITO>might have blasted through some red lights.

448
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,870
<25-15,BECKETT>好吧  像是在撞大运  不过还是试一试吧
<25-15,BECKETT>Yeah. It's a bit of a hail mary, but it's worth a try.

449
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,250
<25-16,CASTLE>或许我们用不着交通监控录像
<25-16,CASTLE>Maybe we don't need traffic cams.

450
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,410
<25-16,CASTLE>问问大街上的人就可以了
<25-16,CASTLE>Why not just the man on the street?

451
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,810
<25-16,CASTLE>我是说  名人开着辆布加迪威航
<25-16,CASTLE>I mean, a celebrity in a Bugatti Veyron? Come on.

452
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,420
<25-16,CASTLE>大家可不仅仅是注意到
<25-16,CASTLE>People aren't just gonna notice that.

453
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,320
<25-16,CASTLE>他们会谈论这件事的  确切的说是微博
<25-16,CASTLE>They are going to talk about it, or more specifically, tweet.

454
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,710
<25-16,CASTLE>看吧
<25-16,CASTLE>And...

455
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,800
<25-16,CASTLE>找到了
<25-16,CASTLE>Booyah.

456
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,200
<25-17,BECKETT>凌晨一点三十七  鲍比·曼 FTW
<25-17,BECKETT>1:37 a.m. Bobby Mann F.T.W.

457
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,540
<25-17,BECKETT>刚刚看到他把飞船一样的跑车
<25-17,BECKETT>"Just saw him driving some spaceship car

458
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,780

<25-20,CASTLE>- "F.T.W."? - "For the win."

461
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,690
<25-20,CASTLE>意思是我的微博抢了你的微博的风头
<25-20,CASTLE>It means, uh, "My tweet kicks your tweet's butt."

462
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,650
<25-20,CASTLE>我说  贝克特

<25-22,CASTLE>I'm just gonna... take that. Mm-hmm.

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,240
<25-25,BECKETT>更多"安慰"吗
<25-25,BECKETT>More comforting?

<25-27,RYAN>And he never came back for his car.

<25-28,BECKETT>百老汇街1525号是什么地方
<25-28,BECKETT>And what's at 1525 Broadway?

479

480
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,380
<25-29,RYAN>社交广泛而又和蔼可亲的深夜脱口秀主持人
<25-29,RYAN>the gregarious and affable host of "Late Talk."

481
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,820
<25-30,CASTLE>米基  真是糟糕
<25-30,CASTLE>Oh, Mickey... not so fine.

482
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,600
<25-31,RYAN>门卫一点四十五让鲍比进入他的住处

<25-32,BECKETT>这么说米基对我们说谎了
<25-32,BECKETT>So Mickey lied to us.

486
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,720
<25-32,BECKETT>他在投毒时间区内
<25-32,BECKETT>He saw Bobby somewhere right

487
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,910
<25-32,BECKETT>见过鲍比
<25-32,BECKETT>in the middle of our kill zone.

488
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,210
<25-33,CASTLE>他会不会是做个好主人
<25-33,CASTLE>You think he was a good host,

489
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
<25-33,CASTLE>请鲍比喝了一杯饮料
<25-33,CASTLE>offered Bobby a drink?

490
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,390
<26-1,MICKEY>片场像是养老院一样
<26-1,MICKEY>This set looks like an old-age home.

491
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,370
<26-1,MICKEY>所有的东西都要升级  不要紫色和仿麂皮的
<26-1,MICKEY>Everything needs to be updated--no purple, no suede,

492
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,030
<26-1,MICKEY>不要假家具  把这个破玩意拿走
<26-1,MICKEY>no faux finish--and get rid of this stupid thing.

493
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,530
<26-2,BECKETT>已经开始重新装修了  瑞德先生
<26-2,BECKETT>Measuring drapes already, Mr. Reed?

494
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,780
<26-3,MICKEY>不管喜不喜欢  探长
<26-3,MICKEY>Like it or not, Detective,

495
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,550
<26-3,MICKEY>电视台希望我在下周悼念节目之后
<26-3,MICKEY>The network wants me to take over

<26-3,MICKEY>接过鲍比的时间段开始新节目
<26-3,MICKEY>Bobby's time slot next week right after the tribute.

497
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,630
<26-3,MICKEY>我知道这看起来有些无情
<26-3,MICKEY>I know it seems callous,

498
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,910
<26-3,MICKEY>不过鲍比肯定也希望这样
<26-3,MICKEY>but it's what Bobby would've wanted.

499
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,240
<26-4,CASTLE>-即使是踩着他的尸体  -你说什么
<26-4,CASTLE>- Even over his dead body? - Excuse me?

500
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,380
<26-5,MICKEY>那晚你见过曼  为什么要说谎
<26-5,MICKEY>Why did you lie to us about seeing Mann the other night?

501
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,110
<26-6,BECKETT>好吧
<26-6,BECKETT>Okay.

502
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,090
<26-7,MICKEY>我很抱歉
<26-7,MICKEY>Look, I'm sorry,

503
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,480
<26-7,MICKEY>不过我说谎是因为我不希望消息传出来
<26-7,MICKEY>but I lied because I didn't want it getting out.

504
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,660
<26-8,CASTLE>说你们两个争吵
<26-8,CASTLE>That you two were fighting?

505
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,870
<26-9,MICKEY>我接过他的衣钵已经很不容易了
<26-9,MICKEY>It's hard enough filling the man's shoes around here.

506
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,310
<26-9,MICKEY>我不希望小报报道我们在他去世那天
<26-9,MICKEY>I don't need the tabloids writing about us getting into it

507
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,400
<26-9,MICKEY>发生过争吵
<26-9,MICKEY>on the night he died.

508
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,330
<26-10,BECKETT>-不就是说谎嘛  没什么大不了的  -你对警察说了谎
<26-10,BECKETT>- So I lied. So what? - So you lied to a cop.

509
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,650
<26-11,MICKEY>我们现实一点吧
<26-11,MICKEY>Let's be realistic.

510
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,550
<26-11,MICKEY>他死于心脏病  不是吗
<26-11,MICKEY>The guy died from a heart attack, right?

511
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,000
<26-12,BECKETT>-怎么了  -的确是心脏病
<26-12,BECKETT>- What? - It was a heart attack that was a result

512
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,690
<26-12,BECKETT>触发原因是他体内的毒素  这毒素就是
<26-12,BECKETT>of toxins in his system, toxins that he ingested

513
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,250
<26-12,BECKETT>在你和他见面的时间内摄入的
<26-12,BECKETT>somewhere around the time that you saw him.

514
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,210
<26-13,MICKEY>你们是说我杀了鲍比
<26-13,MICKEY>So you guys are saying I killed Bobby?

515
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,630
<26-14,CASTLE>-为什么  -也不是什么秘密了
<26-14,CASTLE>- Why? - Well, it's no secret,

516
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,160
<26-14,CASTLE>你本来要接过他十一点半这个时间段的
<26-14,CASTLE>You were supposed to get his 11:30 slot,

517
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,040
<26-14,CASTLE>不过鲍比延长了他的合同
<26-14,CASTLE>but Bobby extended his contract.

518
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,490
<26-14,CASTLE>也许你等不及了
<26-14,CASTLE>Maybe you couldn't wait.

519
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,300
<26-15,MICKEY>-你听起来就和鲍比一样疯狂  -什么意思
<26-15,MICKEY>- You sound as demented as Bobby. - What do you mean?

520
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,890
<26-16,BECKETT>上次和他见面  我们还是好朋友呢
<26-16,BECKETT>Last time I saw him, we're best of pals, right?

521
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,480
<26-17,MICKEY>那天晚上他来找我  他一直大喊大叫
<26-17,MICKEY>The other night he comes over, he's ranting and raving,

522
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,420
<26-17,MICKEY>说我是个不守信誉的臭小子
<26-17,MICKEY>talking about what a disloyal punk I've been.

523
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,190
<29-4,BECKETT>-为什么  -我也不知道
<29-4,BECKETT>-Why? - Man, I don't know.

524
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,220
<29-4,BECKETT>他一直说他知道内幕
<29-4,BECKETT>All he kept saying was, he knew things.

525
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,480
<29-4,BECKETT>我就问  "你在说什么  鲍比"
<29-4,BECKETT>And I'm like, "Bobby, what are you talking about?"

526
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,130
<29-4,BECKETT>他冲出我家大喊  "你做了什么你知道"
<29-4,BECKETT>He storms out saying I knew what I'd done.

527
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,030
<27-1,BECKETT>鉴证组正在米基的公寓检查毒素的痕迹
<27-1,BECKETT>CSU's at Mickey's apartment running a sweep for our toxin.

528
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,920
<27-2,CASTLE>杀掉深夜秀的国王  自己登基
<27-2,CASTLE>Killing the king of late-night to take his throne--

529
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
<27-2,CASTLE>很有理查德三世[英国国王]的风范
<27-2,CASTLE>It's very "Richard III."

530
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,100
<27-2,CASTLE>很吸引当作家的我
<27-2,CASTLE>It appeals to the writer in me.

531
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,160
<27-2,CASTLE>你要咬一口吗
<27-2,CASTLE>Did you want a bite of this?

532
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,080
<27-3,WEISBERG>告诉你  你们死定了
<27-3,WEISBERG>Hell, I'll sick god on you!

533
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,690
<27-3,WEISBERG>至于你  再也不要想上我电视网的节目
<27-3,WEISBERG>And you? I don't ever want to see you

534
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,690
<27-3,WEISBERG>你被封杀了  你
<27-3,WEISBERG>on my network again. You're banned! And you?!

535
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,690
<27-3,WEISBERG>我不认识你
<27-3,WEISBERG>I don't know you.

536
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,260
<27-3,WEISBERG>你们都是些无名小卒  我可以买下这个警局

00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,190
<27-4,MONTGOMERY>搜查令
<27-4,MONTGOMERY>for Mickey Reed.

540
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,030
<27-4,MONTGOMERY>他也发现了我们认为
<27-4,MONTGOMERY>And he also found out that we think

541
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,600
<27-5,BECKETT>-鲍比·曼是被谋杀的  -怎么会
<27-5,BECKETT>- Bobby Mann was murdered. - How?

542
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,180
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>被另外一家电视网抢了头条
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>Breaking news on a different network.

543
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,530
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>他自家明星的新闻被别人抢去了
<27-6,MONTGOMERY>The guy got scooped on his own star's murder.

544
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,240
<27-7,BECKETT>现在想让媒体封口是不可能了
<27-7,BECKETT>So much for keeping the press out.

545
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,100
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>你们两个的判断最好是对的
<27-8,MONTGOMERY>You two better be right about all this.

546
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,000
<27-9,BECKETT>看着短信傻笑  不是吧
<27-9,BECKETT>Text giggling? Really?

547
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,560
<27-10,CASTLE>是阿丽克西斯  她看见潜鸟在进食

550
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,750
<27-12,RYAN>没有搜查令  我们可碰不了车
<27-12,RYAN>They won't let us touch it without a search warrant.

551
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,190
<27-13,ESPOSITO>两百万美金的车
<27-13,ESPOSITO>$2-million car.

552
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,520
<27-13,ESPOSITO>很显然  比保险单上标的更贵
<27-13,ESPOSITO>Apparently, it's worth more than their insurance policy.

553
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,670
<27-14,CASTLE>你确定  他们不是在驾车兜风吗
<27-14,CASTLE>You sure they aren't joyriding?

554
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,650
<27-15,BECKETT>-好吧  找法官签搜查令  -好的
<27-15,BECKETT>- All right, check with the judge.  - Mm-hmm.Okay.

555
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,070
<27-17,ESPOSITO>如果这辆车还在车库里
<27-17,ESPOSITO>If his car is still in the garage,

<27-18,CASTLE>where'd he go after Mickey's place?

557
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,910
<27-19,BECKETT>不会是太远的地方
<27-19,BECKETT>Well, it couldn't have been very far.

558
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,990
<27-19,BECKETT>嘿  莱恩  米基的门卫提到
<27-19,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. Did Mickey's doorman mention

559
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,610
<27-19,BECKETT>曼离开时朝哪个方向去了吗
<27-19,BECKETT>what direction Mann was headed when he left?

560
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,960
<27-21,ESPOSITO>-嗯...  -南边
<27-21,ESPOSITO>- Uh...  - South.

561
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,470
<27-21,ESPOSITO>南边
<27-21,ESPOSITO>South.

562
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,270
<27-23,CASTLE>沿百老汇街从五十七街向南走
<27-23,CASTLE>South on Broadway from 57th.

563
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,730
<27-23,CASTLE>那里是剧场所在地
<27-23,CASTLE>That's the theater district.

564
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,380
<27-24,BECKETT>早晨两点  还没开门呢
<27-24,BECKETT>Two in the morning? There's nothing playing then.

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,680
<27-25,CASTLE>但是那里有小餐馆  俱乐部 饭店
<27-25,CASTLE>Well, there's diners, there's clubs, there's restaurants.

566
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,510
<27-26,BECKETT>除了毒药和口香糖之外
<27-26,BECKETT>Well, other than the poison and the gum,

567
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,150
<27-26,BECKETT>我们知道他没吃也没喝
<27-26,BECKETT>we know he didn't eat or drink anything.

568
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,540
<27-27,CASTLE>也许"TORY"是他去的一个地方
<27-27,CASTLE>Maybe "TORY" is a place he went.

569
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,890
<27-27,CASTLE>音乐学院  货仓  炼狱
<27-27,CASTLE>Uh, conservatory, inventory, purgatory--

570
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,550
<27-28,BECKETT>工厂  娱乐工厂  曼是个喜剧演员
<27-28,BECKETT>Factory! The Comic Factory. Mann was a comedian.

571
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,730
<27-28,BECKETT>他去了喜剧俱乐部
<27-28,BECKETT>He went to a comedy club.

572
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,890
<27-29,CASTLE>娱乐工厂在百老汇街和五十五街交口
<27-29,CASTLE>Comic Factory is on, uh, 55th and Broadway.

573
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,850
<27-29,CASTLE>隔两条街区的南边  他把口香糖
<27-29,CASTLE>That's two blocks south. He put his gum in a--

574
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,520
<27-29,CASTLE>粘在了一张娱乐工厂的传单上
<27-29,CASTLE>in a piece of paper from a comic factory flyer.

575
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,190
<27-30,BECKETT>-你是对的  -基于这一点
<27-30,BECKETT>- You're right.  - Then from the forensics,

576
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,040
<27-30,BECKETT>我们知道他在吐出口香糖之前
<27-30,BECKETT>we know he didn't have the cranberry

577
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,780
<27-30,BECKETT>既没有喝蔓越橘汁  也没有喝甜醋
<27-30,BECKETT>or the balsamic before he spit it out.

578
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,090
<27-31,CASTLE>因此他是在俱乐部时或之后被下毒的
<27-31,CASTLE>So he was poisoned either at or after the club.

579
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,530
<27-32,BECKETT>就是说米基·瑞德不是杀害鲍比的凶手
<27-32,BECKETT>Then Mickey Reed didn't kill Bobby.

580
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,940
<27-32,BECKETT>他不是我们的嫌疑人了
<27-32,BECKETT>He's not our guy.

581
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,130
<27-32,BECKETT>伙计们
<27-32,BECKETT>Hey, guys.

582
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,510
<27-32,BECKETT>去看一场喜剧表演怎么样
<27-32,BECKETT>How do you feel about going to see a little comedy?

583
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,950
<28-1,ESPOSITO>在喜剧界里  他是最脸熟的
<28-1,ESPOSITO>The guy's got the most recognizable face in comedy.

584
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,820
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>我知道  我在俱乐部接到一个电话
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>Yeah, I know. Look, I got a call on the club phone.

585
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,590
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>来电显示的是鲍比的节目组
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>The caller I.D.'s from Bobby's Show.

586
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,190
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>对方向我打听我这里的一名喜剧演员
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>A guy asks about one of my comedians.

587
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,960
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>几小时后  有人过来看了那位演员的演出
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>Couple hours later, guy shows up to see that comedian,

588
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,750
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>不过他留着好笑的小胡子
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>but he's got a funny looking moustache

589
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,500
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>戴着棒球帽  看起来像是鲍比
<28-2,OWNER OF THE CLUB>and he's wearing a baseball cap. It looked like Bobby.

590
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,630
<28-3,RYAN>他有和人说话吗  有喝过东西吗
<28-3,RYAN>Did he talk to anyone? Did he have a drink?

591
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,040
<28-4,OWNER>没有  他坐在后面
<28-4,OWNER>No. He sat in the back,

592
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,320
<28-4,OWNER>他看完那位喜剧演员的表演后
<28-4,OWNER>left his drink ticket, and bolted out the side

593
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,190
<28-4,OWNER>丢下了换饮料的小票  就跑出去了
<28-4,OWNER>after watching the comedian he came to see.

594
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,440
<28-5,RYAN>这个喜剧演员有什么特别的吗
<28-5,RYAN>Anything special about this particular comedian?

595
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,810
<28-5,RYAN>安吉·桑塔纳

<28-6,OWNER>I'm assuming you know about the incident that night?

<28-10,ANGEL>Oh, hey. Thanks for coming.

603
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,250
<28-10,ANGEL>那天问我话的警官让我觉得案子破不了
<28-10,ANGEL>The officer I talked to did not instill a lot of confidence.

604
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,760
<28-11,ESPOSITO>能说说发生什么事了吗
<28-11,ESPOSITO>You want to tell us about it?

605
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,750
<28-12,ANGEL>没什么可说的  我表演的那晚
<28-12,ANGEL>Not much to tell. During my set that night,

606
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,330
<28-12,ANGEL>有人弄碎了我摩托车的尾灯
<28-12,ANGEL>someone smashed my bike's taillight,

607
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
<28-12,ANGEL>毁坏了挡泥板
<28-12,ANGEL>banged up the fenders

608
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,550
<28-12,ANGEL>在车身上刻了"午夜贱货"几个字
<28-12,ANGEL>and scratched "Late-night bitch" into the tank.

609
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,310
<28-12,ANGEL>我是说  这是什么意思
<28-12,ANGEL>I mean, what does that even mean?

610
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,890
<28-13,RYAN>事实上  我们不是为你的摩托车而来的
<28-13,RYAN>Actually, we're not here about your bike.

611
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,350
<28-14,ESPOSITO>桑塔纳小姐  你认识鲍比·曼吗
<28-14,ESPOSITO>Ms. Santana, did you know Bobby Mann?

<28-15,ANGEL>私人交往上  不认识  为什么
<28-15,ANGEL>You mean personally? No. Why?

613
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,440
<28-16,RYAN>因为在他被杀的那个晚上
<28-16,RYAN>Well, because he came to see your act

614
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,550
<28-16,RYAN>他来这看了你的演出  知道为什么吗
<28-16,RYAN>on the night he was killed. Any idea why?

615
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,190
<28-17,ANGEL>天啊  很可能是他毁了我的摩托
<28-17,ANGEL>Wow. He probably trashed my bike.

616
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,620
<28-17,ANGEL>我听说过他的伎俩
<28-17,ANGEL>I've heard stories about him.

617
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,910
<28-17,ANGEL>就因为有人上了他对头的节目
<28-17,ANGEL>I know guys he's blackballed

618
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,990
<28-17,ANGEL>他就会想方设法的排挤那人
<28-17,ANGEL>just because they did his competitors' show.

619
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,440
<28-18,ESPOSITO>你知道他找你麻烦
<28-18,ESPOSITO>Is there any reason why

620
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,190
<28-18,ESPOSITO>有什么特别的原因吗
<28-18,ESPOSITO>he might have wanted to come after you?

621
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,620
<28-19,ANGEL>上个月  他的制片人约我上他的节目
<28-19,ANGEL>His producer tried to book me on his show last month,

622
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,100
<28-19,ANGEL>但是米基·瑞德也想约我
<28-19,ANGEL>but Mickey Reed wanted me, too.

623
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,220
<28-19,ANGEL>我得做选择
<28-19,ANGEL>I had to pick.

624
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,220
<28-19,ANGEL>米基更合我的口味
<28-19,ANGEL>Mickey felt more like my vibe.

625
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,200
<29-1,ESPOSITO>俱乐部老板说鲍比在两点半离开
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Club owner said Bobby left at 2:30,

626
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,920
<29-1,ESPOSITO>吧台招待确认他没喝任何东西
<29-1,ESPOSITO>and the bartender confirms he didn't drink anything.

627
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,240
<29-2,BECKETT>这样只剩下两个小时
<29-2,BECKETT>Which leaves us... two hours left

628
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,840
<29-2,BECKETT>来解释这一系列奇怪的行为
<29-2,BECKETT>to account for and a whole lot of strange behavior.

629
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,890
<29-2,BECKETT>鲍比为什么去见一个不愿上他节目的
<29-2,BECKETT>Why would Bobby go see a comedian

630
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,110
<29-2,BECKETT>喜剧演员  还砸烂了她的摩托车
<29-2,BECKETT>who didn't want to do his show and then bust up her bike?

631
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,680
<29-3,RYAN>名人不都比较疯狂和自恋吗
<29-3,RYAN>Aren't famous people crazy and narcissistic?

632
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,290
<29-4,BECKETT>我不清楚  去问卡塞尔
<29-4,BECKETT>I don't know. Gotta ask Castle.

633
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,010
<29-5,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔去哪了
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Where is Castle anyway?

<30-2,ELLIE>Good morning.

637
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,660
<31-1,CASTLE>没关系  卡塞尔  你不需要为我装成
<31-1,CASTLE>It's okay, Castle. You don't have to pretend

638
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,500
<31-2,BECKETT>心情不好的样子
<31-2,BECKETT>to not be in a good mood for my sake.

639
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,370
<31-3,CASTLE>我为什么要心情好
<31-3,CASTLE>Why should I be in a good mood?

640
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,200
<31-3,CASTLE>我是说...  我是作家
<31-3,CASTLE>I mean... I'm a writer.

641
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,860
<31-3,CASTLE>作家都很忧郁
<31-3,CASTLE>We... famously brood.

642
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,020
<31-3,CASTLE>我们...  我应该更忧郁一点
<31-3,CASTLE>We... I should brood more.

643
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,990
<31-3,CASTLE>你想要忧郁
<31-3,CASTLE>You want to brood?

644
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,680
<31-4,BECKETT>安吉·桑塔纳的摩托车上毫无线索
<31-4,BECKETT>Forensics on Angel Santana's motorcycle are a bust.

645
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,230
<31-4,BECKETT>没有指纹  什么也没有
<31-4,BECKETT>There's no fingerprints. Nothing.

646
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,710
<31-4,BECKETT>我们搞不清曼两点半后在哪儿
<31-4,BECKETT>We have no idea where Mann was after 2:30.

647
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,900
<31-5,CASTLE>他的车呢
<31-5,CASTLE>What about his car?

648
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,200
<31-6,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托拿到了搜查令
<31-6,BECKETT>Ryan and Esposito got a warrant this morning.

649
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,080
<31-6,BECKETT>但我们知道他是在停车后被下毒的
<31-6,BECKETT>But seeing that he was poisoned after he parked it,

650
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,760
<31-6,BECKETT>所以车上可能不会有什么线索
<31-6,BECKETT>chances are we won't find anything.

651
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,820
<31-6,BECKETT>而且  他的财产状况良好
<31-6,BECKETT>And his financials were clear.

652
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,240
<31-6,BECKETT>他一天支付的离婚赡养费
<31-6,BECKETT>He pays more in alimony

653
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,390
<31-6,BECKETT>比我整整一年赚的还多
<31-6,BECKETT>in a day than I make in an entire year.

654
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,270
<31-6,BECKETT>他的电话记录上也没什么线索
<31-6,BECKETT>There's no red flags on his phone records.

655
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,030
<31-6,BECKETT>我再次询问了他所有的同事
<31-6,BECKETT>And I reinterviewed all of his colleagues.

656
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,940
<31-6,BECKETT>没有人知道他为什么表现的如此多疑
<31-6,BECKETT>No one has any idea why he was acting so paranoid.

657
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,550
<31-7,CASTLE>如果有人真要杀你  你就不算是多疑
<31-7,CASTLE>You're not paranoid if someone's actually trying to kill you.

658
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,730
<31-7,CASTLE>托尼  我最喜爱的电影大亨最近如何
<31-7,CASTLE>Hey, Tony! How's my favorite movie mogul?

659
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,240
<31-7,CASTLE>是的  没错吧
<31-7,CASTLE>Yes. Right?

660
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,160
<31-7,CASTLE>她是妮基的最佳人选
<31-7,CASTLE>She'd be perfect for Nikki.

661
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,750
<31-7,CASTLE>好的  太棒了
<31-7,CASTLE>Yes. Perfect.

662
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,860
<31-7,CASTLE>谢谢
<31-7,CASTLE>Thank you.

663
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,350
<31-7,CASTLE>那是《希特热浪》的制片人
<31-7,CASTLE>That's a "Heat Wave" producer.

664
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,880
<31-8,BECKETT>不是关于艾丽·梦露的吧  对吗
<31-8,BECKETT>That wasn't about Ellie Monroe, was it?

665
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,870
<31-9,CASTLE>-是啊  怎么了  -哦
<31-9,CASTLE>- Yeah, why?  - Oh.

666
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,720
<31-11,CASTLE>怎么了
<31-11,CASTLE>What?

667
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,030
<31-12,BECKETT>那就解释了她为什么向你投怀送抱
<31-12,BECKETT>That's why she was throwing herself at you.

668
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,790
<31-12,BECKETT>她想让你推荐她  从而得到那个角色
<31-12,BECKETT>She wanted you to recommend her for the part.

669
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,550
<31-13,CASTLE>什么
<31-13,CASTLE>What?

670
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,920
<31-14,BECKETT>我要强调一下  她一点都不像妮基·希特
<31-14,BECKETT>Oh, and for the record, she's nothing like Nikki Heat.

671
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,690
<31-15,CASTLE>你只是无法忍受一个美丽的女演员
<31-15,CASTLE>Oh, you just can't stand it that a beautiful actress

672
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,820
<31-15,CASTLE>会对我产生兴趣
<31-15,CASTLE>is actually interested in me.

673
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,920
<31-16,BECKETT>我为什么要关心呢
<31-16,BECKETT>Why would I care?

674
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,200
<31-17,CASTLE>确切来说  这是个好问题
<31-17,CASTLE>Exactly. That's a good question.

675
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,270
<31-17,CASTLE>你为什么要关心呢
<31-17,CASTLE>Why would you care?

676
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,910
<31-19,CASTLE>-我才不会  -好吧  我要去拿咖啡
<31-19,CASTLE>- I don't.  - Fine. I'm gonna go get some coffee.

677
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,630
<31-20,BECKETT>好呀  我要回去工作
<31-20,BECKETT>Fine. I've got work to do.

678
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,830
<31-21,CASTLE>休息室在那边
<31-21,CASTLE>Break room's that way.

679
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,110
<31-22,BECKETT>-桌子这边  -贝克特
<31-22,BECKETT>- Desk.  - Beckett.

680
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,320
<31-23,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  听听这个
<31-23,ESPOSITO>Castle. Check this out.

681
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,930
<31-23,ESPOSITO>我们刚调查了鲍比的车
<31-23,ESPOSITO>We just finished the sweep of Bobby's car.

682
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,470
<31-23,ESPOSITO>首先  这辆布加迪  极速换挡
<31-23,ESPOSITO>First off, the Bugatti-- holy shift.

683
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,370
<31-23,ESPOSITO>当你发动这辆车  那感觉就像是...
<31-23,ESPOSITO>When you start this thing, you can feel it right in--

684
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,260
<31-24,RYAN>跟这车同样令人兴奋的是
<31-24,RYAN>But as exciting as the car is,

685
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,670
<31-24,RYAN>我想我们发现鲍比·曼坐立不安的原因了
<31-24,RYAN>I think we figured out why Bobby Mann was so tweaked.

686
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,020
<31-24,RYAN>我们在车的杂物箱里发现了这个
<31-24,RYAN>We found this in his glove compartment.

687
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,580
<31-25,CASTLE>那是凯拉  鲍比脱口秀的实习生
<31-25,CASTLE>That's Kayla. She's an intern at Bobby's show.

688
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,050
<31-26,RYAN>看来她不仅仅是实习而已
<31-26,RYAN>Looks like she was doing more than interning.

689
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,530
<31-27,ESPOSITO>看看照片后面
<31-27,ESPOSITO>You should check out the back.

690
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,670
<31-28,CASTLE>如果他们发现  你就死定了
<31-28,CASTLE>"If they find out, you're dead."

691
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,220
<31-28,CASTLE>勒索  死亡恐吓及丑闻
<31-28,CASTLE>Blackmail, death threats and scandal.

692
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,560
<31-29,BECKETT>正好解释他行为怪异的原因
<31-29,BECKETT>That explains why his behavior was so erratic.

693
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,250
<31-30,CASTLE>也可能是他被杀的原因
<31-30,CASTLE>And probably why he was killed.

694
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,010
<32-1,KAYLA>是在上周
<32-1,KAYLA>It was last week.

695
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,330
<32-1,KAYLA>我加班为鲍比处理一些琐碎工作
<32-1,KAYLA>I stayed late to help Bobby with some bits.

696
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,150
<32-2,BECKETT>凯拉  你知道是谁偷拍的吗
<32-2,BECKETT>Do you have any idea who took that, Kayla?

697
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,590
<32-3,KAYLA>可能是节目的工作人员
<32-3,KAYLA>Must be someone who works on the show.

698
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,680
<32-4,BECKETT>那人刚好有相机
<32-4,BECKETT>Who just happened to have a camera

699
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,740
<32-4,BECKETT>抓拍到你们俩的奸情
<32-4,BECKETT>and managed to catch the two of you in the act?

700
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,080
<32-4,BECKETT>还是有人给他们通风报信
<32-4,BECKETT>Or were they tipped off maybe?

701
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,110
<32-4,BECKETT>你在勒索鲍比吗
<32-4,BECKETT>Were you blackmailing Bobby?

702
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,560
<32-5,KAYLA>我的天啊  不是
<32-5,KAYLA>Oh, my god. No.

703
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,020
<32-6,CASTLE>他的年纪可比你大三倍
<32-6,CASTLE>He's three times your age,

704
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,060
<32-6,CASTLE>你又是节目组的实习生
<32-6,CASTLE>and you are an intern on the show.

705
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,610
<32-6,CASTLE>这会给他制造难堪和丑闻
<32-6,CASTLE>That adds up to embarrassment and scandal,

706
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,310
<32-6,CASTLE>我敢肯定他会付一大笔钱来摆平
<32-6,CASTLE>which I'm sure he'd pay a lot to avoid.

707
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,800
<32-7,KAYLA>不  我绝不会这么做
<32-7,KAYLA>No, I would never do that.

708
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,290
<32-7,KAYLA>我们是真心相爱的
<32-7,KAYLA>We were in love.

709
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,090
<32-8,BECKETT>相爱  真的吗
<32-8,BECKETT>In love? Really?

710
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,960
<32-8,BECKETT>你们俩在一起多久了
<32-8,BECKETT>And... how long were the two of you together?

711
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,990
<32-9,KAYLA>到周一为止刚好三个星期
<32-9,KAYLA>Three weeks this past Monday.

712
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,540
<32-10,CASTLE>还有谁知道
<32-10,CASTLE>Who else knew?

713
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,620
<32-11,KAYLA>没人知道  我们是地下情
<32-11,KAYLA>No one. Bobby and I kept it a secret.

714
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,440
<32-11,KAYLA>我们不希望我妈妈发现
<32-11,KAYLA>We didn't want my mom to find out.

715
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,910
<32-12,CASTLE>你妈妈
<32-12,CASTLE>Your mom?

716
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,370
<32-13,BECKETT>你妈妈是谁
<32-13,BECKETT>Who's your mom?

717
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,690
<32-13,BECKETT>他竟然在我眼皮底下跟我女儿乱搞
<32-13,BECKETT>He was banging my daughter right under my nose?

718
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,770
<33-1,CASTLE>-我要杀了他  -他已经死了
<33-1,CASTLE>- I will kill him!  - He's already dead.

719
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,010
<33-1,CASTLE>那我要让他再死一遍
<33-1,CASTLE>Well, I will kill him again.

720
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,090
<33-2,BECKETT>我不在乎  尸体在哪
<33-2,BECKETT>I don't care. Where's the corpse?

721
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,470
<33-2,BECKETT>马克斯夫人  我们
<33-2,BECKETT>Ms. Marks, we just--

722
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,450
<33-2,BECKETT>凯拉  马上到我办公室  快点
<33-2,BECKETT>Kayla, my office, now! Move it!

723
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,190
<33-3,KAYLA>-妈妈  你不明白  -快去
<33-3,KAYLA>- Mom, you don't understand  - Move it.

724
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,860
<33-4,HANK>你知道  如果这事传出去
<33-4,HANK>You realize, if this gets out,

725
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,690
<33-4,HANK>会毁了鲍比的声誉
<33-4,HANK>it'll destroy Bobby's reputation.

726
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,140
<33-5,BECKETT>我们并不想添乱
<33-5,BECKETT>We're not trying to add to an already difficult situation.

727
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,340
<33-5,BECKETT>我们只想找到凶手
<33-5,BECKETT>We're just trying to find the killer.

728
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,770
<33-6,HANK>鲍比不是个完人
<33-6,HANK>Bobby wasn't an angel,

729
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,750
<33-6,HANK>但纵观他的一生
<33-6,HANK>but you look at the man in his entirety.

730
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,720
<33-6,HANK>他值得流芳百世
<33-6,HANK>He deserves to be remembered with grace.

731
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,300
<33-6,HANK>这一行被金钱  名声和野心所笼罩
<33-6,HANK>This business gets clouded by money, fame, ambition.

732
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,770
<33-6,HANK>鲍比真正在乎的
<33-6,HANK>The only thing that Bobby really cared about

733
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,300
<33-6,HANK>就是给人们带来欢笑
<33-6,HANK>was making people laugh.

734
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,460
<33-7,BECKETT>拍这照片的人  不是这里的工作人员
<33-7,BECKETT>Well, whoever took this either works for this show

735
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,100
<33-7,BECKETT>就是可以自由进出大厦的人
<33-7,BECKETT>or had access to this building.

736
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,790
<33-7,BECKETT>也许是有人手头拮据
<33-7,BECKETT>And maybe it was someone in a financial jam

737
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,250
<33-7,BECKETT>想挣个外快
<33-7,BECKETT>who was looking to score a quick buck.

738
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,700
<33-7,BECKETT>也可能有人对鲍比怀恨在心
<33-7,BECKETT>Or maybe it's someone with a grudge against Bobby.

739
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,640
<33-8,HANK>我想不出谁会这么干
<33-8,HANK>I can't imagine anyone doing that.

740
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,380
<33-8,HANK>他是位好上司  大家都爱他
<33-8,HANK>He was a great boss. Everyone loved him.

741
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,390
<33-9,CASTLE>没错  显然他也爱他们
<33-9,CASTLE>Yeah, and apparently, he loved them back.

742
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,510
<33-10,HANK>好吧  等珍妮教训完凯拉
<33-10,HANK>Okay. Uh, Janine can get you a list of everyone on the crew

743
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,660
<33-10,HANK>她会给你一份工作人员名单
<33-10,HANK>once she's done yelling at Kayla.

744
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,400
<33-10,HANK>可怜的孩子  谁能想到呢
<33-10,HANK>Poor kid. Who knows?

745
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,500
<33-10,HANK>她有可能是他第七任妻子的
<33-10,HANK>She might have ended up being number seven.

747
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,300
<34-1,BECKETT>有什么发现
<34-1,BECKETT>What have we got?

748
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,210
<34-2,RYAN>既然我们怀疑是勒索
<34-2,RYAN>Well, once we suspected blackmail,

749
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,570
<34-2,RYAN>我就又查看了他的账户
<34-2,RYAN>I ran through his financials again.

750
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,760
<34-3,BECKETT>我以为财产情况没问题
<34-3,BECKETT>I thought they were clean.

751
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,220
<34-4,RYAN>原先没问题  但复查后发现这个
<34-4,RYAN>Well, they were, but going back, we found this.

752
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,200
<34-5,BECKETT>他花了十万美金翻修厨房
<34-5,BECKETT>He spent 100 grand on a kitchen reno.

753
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,920
<34-6,RYAN>完全合法  但我们搜查了他的住所
<34-6,RYAN>Totally legitimate, but we searched his brownstone--

754
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,980
<34-7,CASTLE>发现他并未翻修厨房
<34-7,CASTLE>And he wasn't renovating his kitchen.

755
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,920
<34-8,BECKETT>那是谁收了这十万美金
<34-8,BECKETT>So who was on the receiving end of the 100 grand?

756
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,110
<34-9,RYAN>扎克·罗宾森
<34-9,RYAN>Zach Robinson.

757
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,960
<34-10,CASTLE>这坏人的名字太妙了
<34-10,CASTLE>Ooh. Good bad-guy name.

758
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,580
<34-10,CASTLE>狡猾的"Z"  冷酷的"K"
<34-10,CASTLE>Snakey "Z", Hard "K".

759
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,180
<34-10,CASTLE>甚至还有"抢劫"在里边[rob有抢劫之意]
<34-10,CASTLE>Even has "Rob" in it.

760
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,600
<34-11,RYAN>前科也符合坏人的标准
<34-11,RYAN>Good bad-guy rap sheet, too.

761
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,060
<34-11,RYAN>以前是个卑劣的私家侦探
<34-11,RYAN>Former lowlife private investigator.

762
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,460
<34-12,BECKETT>我认得这家伙
<34-12,BECKETT>I remember this guy.

763
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,700
<34-12,BECKETT>他曾经有一些名人客户
<34-12,BECKETT>He had some celebrity clients back in the day.

764
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,520
<34-12,BECKETT>他臭名昭著  专挖他人丑闻
<34-12,BECKETT>He was known for digging up dirt on folks

765
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,180
<34-12,BECKETT>并以此谋生
<34-12,BECKETT>and turning it into a personal payday.

766
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,750
<34-13,RYAN>他靠敲诈  窃听  诈骗和勒索
<34-13,RYAN>He did a nickel on multiple counts of extortion,

767
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,850
<34-13,RYAN>挣了一大笔钱
<34-13,RYAN>wire tapping, racketeering and blackmail.

768
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,820
<34-14,BECKETT>罗宾森肯定是通过内部人员
<34-14,BECKETT>Well, Robinson must have gotten the picture

769
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,070
<34-14,BECKETT>搞到这张照片
<34-14,BECKETT>from somebody on the inside.

770
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,000
<34-15,CASTLE>没错  认为是捞钱的好机会
<34-15,CASTLE>Sure. Figured it was worth a fast buck.

771
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,050
<34-15,CASTLE>但如果鲍比给钱了  为什么还杀他呢
<34-15,CASTLE>But if Bobby paid, why would he kill him?

772
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,380
<34-16,BECKETT>鲍比发现罗宾森就是勒索人
<34-16,BECKETT>Bobby figured out that Robinson was a blackmailer,

773
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,930
<34-16,BECKETT>就威胁要向警方举报他
<34-16,BECKETT>and then he threatened to take him to the cops.

774
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,010
<34-17,CASTLE>鲍比把罗宾森逼急了  罗宾森就反击了
<34-17,CASTLE>Bobby pushes, Robinson pushes back harder.

775
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,120
<34-18,BECKETT>-去把他找来  -说得容易做起来难
<34-18,BECKETT>- Let's go pick him up.  - Easier said than done.

776
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,610
<34-19,RYAN>埃斯波西托已经去过他的住所了
<34-19,RYAN>Esposito already ran down his last known address.

777
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,950
<34-19,RYAN>罗宾森下落不明
<34-19,RYAN>Robinson's in the wind.

778
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,290
<34-20,BECKETT>那我们就继续找
<34-20,BECKETT>Well, let's keep looking.

779
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,400
<34-20,BECKETT>好的
<34-20,BECKETT>Yeah.

780
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,810
<35-1,ELLIE>你是个坏人  扎克·罗宾森
<35-1,ELLIE>You are a bad man, Zach Robinson.

781
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,280
<35-1,ELLIE>你这个下流  淘气  一无是处的勒索者
<35-1,ELLIE>A dirty, naughty, no-good blackmailer.

782
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,990
<35-2,CASTLE>你都在床上进行审问吗  希特探长
<35-2,CASTLE>Do you do all your interrogations in bed, Detective Heat?

783
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,020
<35-3,ELLIE>你觉得这很可笑吗  罗宾森
<35-3,ELLIE>You think this is funny, Robinson?

784
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,410
<35-4,CASTLE>好吧
<35-4,CASTLE>Okay, okay.

785
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,820
<35-4,CASTLE>不  我会照你说的做  妮基
<35-4,CASTLE>No, I'll do whatever you want, Nikki.

786
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,930
<35-5,ELLIE>好了  这还差不多
<35-5,ELLIE>Okay. That's more like it.

787
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,050
<35-5,ELLIE>你真是太可爱了
<35-5,ELLIE>You are so sweet.

788
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,810
<35-5,ELLIE>还很聪明
<35-5,ELLIE>And brilliant.

789
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,710
<35-6,CASTLE>说得对
<35-6,CASTLE>Guilty.

790
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,720
<35-7,ELLIE>你在想什么
<35-7,ELLIE>What are you thinking?

791
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,060
<35-8,CASTLE>没什么
<35-8,CASTLE>Nothing.

792
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,440
<35-8,CASTLE>挺可笑的
<35-8,CASTLE>It's ridiculous.

793
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,400
<35-9,ELLIE>什么  说说看  我想知道
<35-9,ELLIE>What? Come on. Tell me. I want to know what goes on

794
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,700
<35-9,ELLIE>你那不可思议的大脑在想些什么
<35-9,ELLIE>inside that incredible mind of yours.

795
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,580
<35-10,CASTLE>既然你这么说
<35-10,CASTLE>Well, since you put it that way.

796
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,030
<35-10,CASTLE>与我共事的一位朋友
<35-10,CASTLE>I have this... friend at work

797
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,150
<35-10,CASTLE>认为你和我一起的唯一原因
<35-10,CASTLE>who thinks that the only reason you're with me is,

798
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,280
<35-10,CASTLE>就是为了得到这个电影角色
<35-10,CASTLE>you know... for the part in the movie.

799
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,300
<35-10,CASTLE>真的吗
<35-10,CASTLE>Really?

800
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,220
<35-11,ELLIE>你这朋友的依据是什么
<35-11,ELLIE>What does this friend of yours base that on?

801
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,310
<35-12,CASTLE>我很抱歉
<35-12,CASTLE>You know what? I'm-- I'm sorry.

802
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,590
<35-12,CASTLE>我不该提这事的
<35-12,CASTLE>I shouldn't have repeated that.

803
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,390
<35-13,ELLIE>-这朋友认识我吗  -不认识
<35-13,ELLIE>- Does this friend know me?  - No.

804
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,880
<35-14,CASTLE>他看了我什么报道就认为
<35-14,CASTLE>Has he read anything about me that would make him think

805
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,290
<35-15,ELLIE>我会利用潜规则获取角色
<35-15,ELLIE>that I would prostitute myself for a role?

806
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,210
<35-16,CASTLE>不  当然不是
<35-16,CASTLE>No. Of course not.

807
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,010
<35-16,CASTLE>你  我  他就是一个笨蛋
<35-16,CASTLE>You--I--he's an idiot.

808
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,770
<35-16,CASTLE>你知道一个女人
<35-16,CASTLE>Do you have any idea

809
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,520
<35-17,ELLIE>在好莱坞闯荡有多艰辛吗
<35-17,ELLIE>how hard it is to be a woman in Hollywood?

810
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,450
<35-17,ELLIE>艾丽
<35-17,ELLIE>Ellie.

811
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,220
<35-17,ELLIE>我
<35-17,ELLIE>I--

813
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,080
<36-1,CASTLE>没错
<36-1,CASTLE>Oh, yeah.

814
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,570
<36-1,CASTLE>他看起来像扎克·罗宾森
<36-1,CASTLE>He looks like a Zach Robinson.

815
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,440
<36-1,CASTLE>在哪找到他的
<36-1,CASTLE>Where'd you find him?

816
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:22,650
<36-2,BECKETT>在金神大赌场的双骰子赌桌
<36-2,BECKETT>The boys caught up with him

817
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:23,710
<36-2,BECKETT>抓到他的
<36-2,BECKETT>at a craps table at Mohegan Sun.

818
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,640
<36-3,CASTLE>辛苦得来的勒索钱财已经赌光了吗
<36-3,CASTLE>Already gambling away his hard-earned blackmail money?

819
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,370
<36-4,BECKETT>和你的小明星约会怎样了
<36-4,BECKETT>So how was your date with your little starlet?

820
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,010
<36-5,CASTLE>这次你是怎么看出来的
<36-5,CASTLE>How can you tell this time?

821
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,600
<36-6,BECKETT>像我说的  卡塞尔  干练的警探
<36-6,BECKETT>Like I said, Castle... trained detective.

822
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,010
<36-7,CASTLE>进展很不错
<36-7,CASTLE>Well... it went lovely.

823
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,880
<36-7,CASTLE>并不是因为你
<36-7,CASTLE>No thanks to you.

824
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,320
<36-8,BECKETT>这和我有关系吗
<36-8,BECKETT>What did I have to do with it?

825
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,850
<36-9,CASTLE>你用了绝地武士[星战角色]控制意志的招数
<36-9,CASTLE>You pulled your Jedi mind trick on me.

826
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,120
<36-9,CASTLE>你让我怀疑艾丽的真诚
<36-9,CASTLE>You made me doubt Ellie's honesty.

827
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,780
<36-9,CASTLE>我真蠢  告诉她你的想法  把她弄哭了
<36-9,CASTLE>Foolishly, I told her what you said, made her cry.

828
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,650
<36-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她是位演员
<36-10,BECKETT>Castle... she's an actress,

829
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,450
<36-10,BECKETT>专业的大话精
<36-10,BECKETT>a professional liar.

830
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:52,440
<36-10,BECKETT>流眼泪可是有薪水拿的
<36-10,BECKETT>She's paid to cry on cue.

831
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,170
<37-12,ZACH>不
<37-12,ZACH>No.

832
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
<37-1,ZACH ROBINSON>我从没见过这张照片
<37-1,ZACH ROBINSON>I've never seen this picture before.

833
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,930
<37-1,ZACH ROBINSON>是吗
<37-1,ZACH ROBINSON>Really?

834
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,970
<37-2,BECKETT>你确定没有用这张照片来勒索鲍比·曼?
<37-2,BECKETT>You sure you didn't use it to blackmail Bobby Mann?

835
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,170
<38-4,BECKETT>勒索
<38-4,BECKETT>Blackmail?

836
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,880
<37-3,ZACH>你完全抓错人了  探长
<37-3,ZACH>You're fishing in the wrong pond, Detective.

837
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,840
<37-4,BECKETT>那鲍比·曼存入你户头的
<37-4,BECKETT>What about the 100 grand

838
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,670
<37-4,BECKETT>十万美元作何解释
<37-4,BECKETT>from Bobby Mann in your bank account?

839
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,390
<37-4,BECKETT>我没抓错人吧
<37-4,BECKETT>Am I in the right pond now?

840
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,870
<37-5,ZACH>那是服务费
<37-5,ZACH>That was for... services rendered.

841
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,090
<37-6,CASTLE>我想韦氏词典没有把"勒索"
<37-6,CASTLE>I don't think Webster's defines "Blackmailing"

842
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,980
<37-6,CASTLE>定义为"服务"吧
<37-6,CASTLE>as a service.

843
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,540
<37-6,CASTLE>应该说是强制性的恐吓吧  "抢劫"先生
<37-6,CASTLE>More like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.

844
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,200
<37-7,ZACH>不不  搞错了  我从来没有威胁过鲍比
<37-7,ZACH>No, no. No, no. I never threatened Bobby.

845
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,490
<37-7,ZACH>他雇用了我
<37-7,ZACH>He hired me.

846
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,440
<37-8,BECKETT>做什么
<37-8,BECKETT>To do what?

847
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,490
<37-8,BECKETT>据我手下的调查  曼被谋害的当晚
<37-8,BECKETT>My guys say that you don't have an alibi

848
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,140
<37-8,BECKETT>你没有不在场证明
<37-8,BECKETT>for the night that Mann was murdered.

849
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
<37-9,ZACH>开玩笑吧
<37-9,ZACH>You can't be serious.

850
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,410
<37-10,BECKETT>是不是玩笑  谋杀审讯时自然见分晓
<37-10,BECKETT>I guess it'll come out when we go to the murder trial.

851
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,910
<37-11,CASTLE>判决如下  狱中生活快乐
<37-11,CASTLE>Have a nice life... sentence.

852
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,100
<37-12,ZACH>什么  别这样  别这样
<37-12,ZACH>What? No, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

853
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,710
<37-12,ZACH>是他来找的我
<37-12,ZACH>Look, he reached out to me.

854
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,560
<37-12,ZACH>说有活儿给我
<37-12,ZACH>Said he needed some work done.

855
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,800
<37-13,BECKETT>什么样的"活儿"
<37-13,BECKETT>What kind of work?

856
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,720
<37-14,ZACH>需要花很多钱的那种
<37-14,ZACH>The kind that you get paid a lot extra to do.

857
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,980
<37-15,BECKETT>违法的
<37-15,BECKETT>Something illegal.

858
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,040
<37-16,ZACH>这个
<37-16,ZACH>W-well...

859
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,170
<37-16,ZACH>听着  他觉得有人盯上他了
<37-16,ZACH>Okay, look, he thought that somebody was out to get him.

860
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,320
<37-16,ZACH>而他想要知道内情
<37-16,ZACH>He said he needed to know,

861
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,790
<37-16,ZACH>于是就雇我在某人的办公室里装窃听器
<37-16,ZACH>and so he paid me to bug a guy's office.

862
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,790
<37-17,BECKETT>谁的办公室
<37-17,BECKETT>Who?

863
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,220
<37-19,CASTLE>-霍华德·维斯伯格  -电视台的总裁
<37-19,CASTLE>- Howard Weisberg. - The president of the network?

864
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,670
<37-20,ZACH>很简单  鲍比把我弄进了办公楼
<37-20,ZACH>Easy gig, too. Bobby got me into the building.

865
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,080
<37-21,BECKETT>什么时候的事
<37-21,BECKETT>When was this?

866
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,120
<37-23,CASTLE>-一周前  -录音带如何处置的
<37-23,CASTLE>- Week ago. - What did you do with the recordings?

867
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,060
<37-24,ZACH>-已经快递给了鲍比  -何时
<37-24,ZACH>- I delivered the CDs to Bobby. - When?

868
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,470
<37-25,BECKETT>就在
<37-25,BECKETT>You know...

869
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,330
<37-26,ZACH>他死的那天早上
<37-26,ZACH>the morning before he died.

870
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,320
<37-27,BECKETT>鲍比的制片人说
<37-27,BECKETT>Bobby's producer said

871
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,030
<37-27,BECKETT>当天早上  他曾把自己锁在办公室内
<37-27,BECKETT>he locked himself in his office that morning.

872
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,710
<37-27,BECKETT>-他在听录音  -之后
<37-27,BECKETT>- He was listening to the recordings. - And then

873
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,140
<37-28,CASTLE>大家说他就开始神经兮兮的
<37-28,CASTLE>they said he started acting paranoid after that,

874
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,470
<37-28,CASTLE>他究竟听到了什么内容
<37-28,CASTLE>so what did he hear?

875
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,930
<37-29,ZACH>我可以走了吗
<37-29,ZACH>Am I good to go?

876
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,480
<38-1,RYAN>在曼的办公室找到录音
<38-1,RYAN>We found the recordings in Mann's office

877
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,160
<38-1,RYAN>和其它电影光盘混在了一起
<38-1,RYAN>mixed in with his DVD collection.

878
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,360
<38-2,BECKETT>有没有发现曼为什么
<38-2,BECKETT>Heard anything yet that would explain

879
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,930
<38-2,BECKETT>要窃听他的上司
<38-2,BECKETT>why Mann was listening in on his boss?

880
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,100
<38-3,RYAN>没有  就是一大堆关于宴请编剧  演员
<38-3,RYAN>Just a bunch of talk about setting up breakfasts, lunches,

881
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,920
<38-3,RYAN>导演的商务会谈的安排
<38-3,RYAN>dinners and drinks with writers, actors and directors.

882
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,050
<38-4,BECKETT>勒索方面有何进展
<38-4,BECKETT>Where are we on the blackmail?

883
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,930
<38-5,RYAN>警员正在调查能够进入演播室拍照
<38-5,RYAN>We got uniforms running down all show employees

884
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,000
<38-5,RYAN>的所有相关工作人员
<38-5,RYAN>who could've had access to the studio to take that photo.

885
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,480
<38-6,ESPOSITO>过来听听这个
<38-6,ESPOSITO>Yo. You guys are gonna want to hear this.

886
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,540
<38-7,WEISBERG>知道吗  让鲍比·曼见鬼去吧
<38-7,WEISBERG>You know what? To hell with Bobby Mann.

887
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,540
<38-7,WEISBERG>每晚他的节目都在赔钱
<38-7,WEISBERG>We're losing money on him every damn night.

888
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,320
<38-8,MAN>-我要他滚蛋  -我们束手无策  不能炒他
<38-8,MAN>- I want him out! - Our hands our tied. You can't fire him.

889
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,230
<38-8,MAN>他还有五年的合同
<38-8,MAN>He's got five years left on his contract.

890
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,950
<39-1,WEISBERG>那他挂了总可以吧
<39-1,WEISBERG>What if he drops dead, huh?

891
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,830
<39-1,WEISBERG>说真的  这家伙心脏不好
<39-1,WEISBERG>Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart.

892
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,970
<39-1,WEISBERG>让他滚蛋有这么难吗
<39-1,WEISBERG>How hard would it be to make him go away?

893
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,490
<38-8,MAN>真是见鬼  米基·瑞德每天都在说
<38-8,MAN>I mean, hell, I got Mickey Reed telling me every day,

894
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,540
<38-9,WEISBERG>他已经准备好了
<38-9,WEISBERG>he's ready to step in

895
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,300
<38-9,WEISBERG>只要鲍比·曼退位  他就立刻顶上
<38-9,WEISBERG>if we could just get Bobby Mann out the damn door.

896
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,090
<38-10,CASTLE>难怪鲍比觉得米基靠不住
<38-10,CASTLE>Well, no wonder Bobby thought Mickey was disloyal.

897
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,080
<38-11,BECKETT>难怪他认为有人想他死
<38-11,BECKETT>And no wonder he thought someone wanted him dead.

898
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,590
<38-11,BECKETT>的确有人要他死
<38-11,BECKETT>Someone did.

899
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,450
<39-1,WEISBERG>那他挂了总可以吧
<39-1,WEISBERG>What if he drops dead, huh?

900
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,610
<39-1,WEISBERG>说真的  这家伙心脏不好
<39-1,WEISBERG>Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart.

901
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,020
<39-1,WEISBERG>让他滚蛋有这么难吗
<39-1,WEISBERG>How hard would it be to make him go away?

902
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,350
<39-2,BECKETT>看来你如愿以偿了  维斯伯格先生
<39-2,BECKETT>Looks like you got your wish, Mr. Weisberg.

903
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,090
<39-3,LAWYER WEISBERG>探长  这些窃听带是无法作为
<39-3,LAWYER WEISBERG>Detective, none of the recordings

904
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,360
<39-3,LAWYER WEISBERG>呈堂证供的
<39-3,LAWYER WEISBERG>are admissible in court.

905
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,140
<39-4,WEISBERG>放轻松  伯特  我没有杀人
<39-4,WEISBERG>Oh, relax, Burt. I didn't kill anyone, okay?

906
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,680
<39-4,WEISBERG>等我真杀了  你再摆律师架子吧
<39-4,WEISBERG>Save it for when I actually do.

907
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,730
<39-5,BECKETT>-探长  这是无心之言  -鲍比认为你是有意的
<39-5,BECKETT>- Detective, I wasn't serious. - Bobby thought you were.

908
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,840
<39-6,WEISBERG>那他就不应该窃听我的办公室
<39-6,WEISBERG>Then maybe he shouldn't have been bugging my office.

909
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,800
<39-6,WEISBERG>私下里  电视台那些拿着高薪不出活的混蛋
<39-6,WEISBERG>Hell, in private, I issue a dozen death sentences a day

910
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,940
<39-6,WEISBERG>我一天至少十几次地诅咒他们去死
<39-6,WEISBERG>on underperforming, overpaid jackasses at my network.

911
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,910
<39-6,WEISBERG>我只是想把米基·瑞德的节目调至十一点半
<39-6,WEISBERG>Now what I wanted was Mickey Reed pulled to 11:30.

912
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,230
<39-6,WEISBERG>但是鲍比手持八千万违约金的合同
<39-6,WEISBERG>But Bobby had an $80-million penalty on his contract.

913
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,030
<39-7,CASTLE>意味着你还得等五年
<39-7,CASTLE>Which still had another five years left on it.

914
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,880
<39-8,WEISBERG>这几个月我的确向鲍比施压
<39-8,WEISBERG>Yeah. Now what I did was lean on Bobby for a few months

915
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,390
<39-8,WEISBERG>让节目要向年轻观众靠拢
<39-8,WEISBERG>to appeal to a younger audience.

916
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,900
<39-8,WEISBERG>但我做的最过分的
<39-8,WEISBERG>But the worst thing that

917
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,530
<39-8,WEISBERG>无非就是威胁说要炒掉他
<39-8,WEISBERG>I did was threaten to fire him

918
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,640
<39-8,WEISBERG>赔他八千万
<39-8,WEISBERG>and pay him the $80 mil.

919
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,130
<39-9,BECKETT>维斯伯格先生  谋杀当晚的凌晨一点半
<39-9,BECKETT>Mr. Weisberg, where were you between 1:30

920
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,970
<39-9,BECKETT>至四点半  你在哪里
<39-9,BECKETT>and 4:30 a.m. the night of the murder?

921
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,300
<39-10,LAWYER>-你有权拒绝回答  -没事  伯特  别激动
<39-10,LAWYER>- You don't have to answer that. - It's fine, Burt. Chill out.

922
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,240
<39-11,WEISBERG>-我在艾塞克斯酒店  -有证人吗
<39-11,WEISBERG>- I was at the Essex House Hotel. - Were you with anyone?

923
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,910
<39-12,BECKETT>事实上我有证人  是位和我上床的女演员
<39-12,BECKETT>As a matter of fact I was. This actress I was screwing

924
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,660
<39-13,WEISBERG>想在我的情景喜剧中捞个角色
<39-13,WEISBERG>wanted a part on one of my sitcoms.

925
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,750
<39-13,WEISBERG>我是通过鲍比的节目遇到她的
<39-13,WEISBERG>I met her after Bobby's show.

926
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,450
<39-14,BECKETT>我要她的名字
<39-14,BECKETT>I'm gonna need a name.

927
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,010
<39-15,WEISBERG>没问题  艾丽·梦露
<39-15,WEISBERG>Sure. Ellie Monroe.

928
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,290
<40-1,BECKETT>谢谢你跑一趟  梦露小姐
<40-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming by Ms. Monroe.

929
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,550
<40-2,ELLIE>应该的
<40-2,ELLIE>Of course.

930
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,990
<40-3,BECKETT>维斯伯格的不在场证明
<40-3,BECKETT>Weisberg's alibi...

931
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,840
<40-3,BECKETT>成立
<40-3,BECKETT>is good.

932
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,980
<40-4,CASTLE>说吧  一吐为快
<40-4,CASTLE>Oh, go on. You can say it.

933
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,830
<40-4,CASTLE>早就警告过你了
<40-4,CASTLE>"I told you so."

934
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,820
<40-5,BECKETT>不用了  我现在没有幸灾乐祸的心情
<40-5,BECKETT>No, thanks. I'm actually not in the gloating mood.

935
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,840
<40-5,BECKETT>他的不在场证明  让我们回到了起点
<40-5,BECKETT>His alibi sets us back to square one...

936
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,980
<40-5,BECKETT>勒索者是谁  我们依然没有头绪
<40-5,BECKETT>Which means we have no idea who the blackmailer is,

937
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,280
<40-5,BECKETT>也不知道曼为什么要去喜剧俱乐部
<40-5,BECKETT>and we don't know why Mann went to the comedy club

938
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,550
<40-5,BECKETT>为什么要砸坏安吉·桑塔纳的摩托车
<40-5,BECKETT>and trashed Angel Santana's bike.

939
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,830
<40-5,BECKETT>更别提找到凶手了
<40-5,BECKETT>And we have no idea who the killer is.

940
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,620
<40-6,CASTLE>好消息就是  我可以整晚工作
<40-6,CASTLE>Well, the good news is, I can work all night.

941
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,960
<40-6,CASTLE>没人可约了
<40-6,CASTLE>No plans.

942
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,060
<40-7,BECKETT>很晚了  我也有些累了
<40-7,BECKETT>You know, it's late, and I'm kinda tired.

943
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,630
<40-7,BECKETT>明早继续如何
<40-7,BECKETT>How about we pick this up in the morning?

944
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,290
<40-8,CASTLE>也好
<40-8,CASTLE>All righty,then.

945
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,730
<40-8,CASTLE>魅力男生  欢乐相约明天
<40-8,CASTLE>And the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow,

946
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,780
<40-8,CASTLE>常言道
<40-8,CASTLE>to coin a phrase...

947
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,930
<40-8,CASTLE>这是不对的
<40-8,CASTLE>which would be inaccurate...

948
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,100
<40-8,CASTLE>因为你不是男生
<40-8,CASTLE>Because you are not a boy.

949
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,930
<40-9,BECKETT>这是什么奇怪的搭讪吗
<40-9,BECKETT>Is this some kind of a weird come-on?

950
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,920
<40-10,CASTLE>我知道鲍比·曼
<40-10,CASTLE>I think I know

951
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,180
<40-10,CASTLE>去喜剧俱乐部的原因了
<40-10,CASTLE>what Bobby Mann was doing at that comedy club.

952
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,280
<40-10,CASTLE>也知道他为什么觉得自己是个很糟糕的人
<40-10,CASTLE>I think I know why he thought he was an awful person.

953
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,970
<40-10,CASTLE>我还知道谁杀了他
<40-10,CASTLE>And... I think I know who killed him.

954
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,220
<41-1,BECKETT>迈克菲先生
<41-1,BECKETT>Mr. McPhee?

955
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,130
<41-2,HANK>我正在看悼念专题节目的致词
<41-2,HANK>I was just going over my notes for the tribute.

956
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,310
<41-2,HANK>三十五年的友谊
<41-2,HANK>35 years of friendship--

957
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,090
<41-2,HANK>想找出最好的故事  真的很难
<41-2,HANK>It's kinda hard to find just the right story to tell.

958
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,940
<41-2,HANK>有什么可以效劳的
<41-2,HANK>What can I do for you?

959
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,490
<41-3,CASTLE>我们来给你这个
<41-3,CASTLE>We just came by to give you this.

960
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,340
<41-3,CASTLE>鲍比的随手笔记  觉得你应该会喜欢
<41-3,CASTLE>Bobby's idea book-- We thought you might like it.

961
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,880
<41-5,BECKETT>-谢谢  -我们也想问问
<41-5,BECKETT>- Thanks. - We did have a

962
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,110
<41-5,BECKETT>上面最后一页写的内容
<41-5,BECKETT>question about what he wrote on the last page.

963
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,410
<41-6,HANK>魅力男生  欢乐相约明晚
<41-6,HANK>"The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night."

964
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,720
<41-7,BECKETT>事实是  他划掉了"男生"
<41-7,BECKETT>Actually, he crossed out "Boys"

965
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,980
<41-7,BECKETT>写上了"超级组合"和"亲密团队"
<41-7,BECKETT>and wrote "Gang, Posse" and "Crew."

966
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,170
<41-7,BECKETT>知道原因吗
<41-7,BECKETT>Any idea why?

967
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,120
<41-8,HANK>可能我们永远都不会知道了
<41-8,HANK>I guess we'll never know.

968
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,760
<41-9,CASTLE>我不这么认为
<41-9,CASTLE>I wouldn't be too sure about that.

969
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,250
<41-9,CASTLE>电视台给鲍比施压  让他作出改变
<41-9,CASTLE>The network was pressuring Bobby to make a change.

970
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,170
<41-9,CASTLE>甚至威胁说不改变就解雇他
<41-9,CASTLE>They threatened to cancel him unless he did.

971
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,170
<41-10,BECKETT>就在他被谋杀当晚
<41-10,BECKETT>And the night that he was murdered,

972
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,520
<41-10,BECKETT>他告诉芭芭拉  有些不好的事即将发生
<41-10,BECKETT>he told Barbara that something awful was going on.

973
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,750
<41-10,BECKETT>他还问她  自己是否是好人
<41-10,BECKETT>He asked her if he was a good person.

974
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,140
<41-10,BECKETT>他为什么那么说
<41-10,BECKETT>Why would he say that?

975
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,730
<41-11,HANK>因为凯拉这件事
<41-11,HANK>Because of Kayla.

976
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,330
<41-12,BECKETT>汉克  与凯拉无关
<41-12,BECKETT>Not Kayla, Hank.

977
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,580
<41-12,BECKETT>是因为你  他知道自己必须要开除你
<41-12,BECKETT>Because of you. He knew that he had to fire you.

978
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,070
<41-12,BECKETT>他知道如果要生存  就要找一位时髦的
<41-12,BECKETT>He knew he needed to find someone younger and hipper

979
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,220
<41-12,BECKETT>时下青年代替你
<41-12,BECKETT>if he was gonna survive.

980
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,400
<41-13,CASTLE>比如说安吉·桑塔纳
<41-13,CASTLE>Someone like Angel Santana.

981
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,430
<41-13,CASTLE>维斯伯格确认了
<41-13,CASTLE>Weisberg confirmed that she was

982
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,540
<41-13,CASTLE>她在最后的候选名单上
<41-13,CASTLE>on the network's short list.

983
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,220
<41-13,CASTLE>汉克  "魅力男生"招牌将不复存在
<41-13,CASTLE>That's why it wasn't "Boys" anymore, Hank.

984
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,510
<41-13,CASTLE>因为安吉是女生
<41-13,CASTLE>'Cause Angel's a girl.

985
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,310
<41-14,HANK>这太荒谬了  鲍比绝对不会炒我的
<41-14,HANK>This is ridiculous. Bobby would never fire me.

986
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,680
<41-15,CASTLE>-那你为什么杀了他  -我没有
<41-15,CASTLE>- Then why did you kill him? - I didn't.

987
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,250
<41-16,HANK>汉克  我们已经查了你的信用卡
<41-16,HANK>We ran your credit cards, Hank.

988
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,670
<41-17,BECKETT>他被谋杀当晚  你在一家
<41-17,BECKETT>The night that he was murdered, you went

989
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,050
<41-17,BECKETT>全天营业的杂货店里  买了两样东西
<41-17,BECKETT>to a 24-hour grocery store and bought two things--

990
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,090
<41-17,BECKETT>蔓越莓汁和甜醋
<41-17,BECKETT>Cranberry juice and balsamic vinegar.

991
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,080
<41-17,BECKETT>时间显示为凌晨一点五十六分
<41-17,BECKETT>It's time stamped 1:56 a.m.

992
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,710
<41-18,CASTLE>我敢肯定如果化验你的钥匙
<41-18,CASTLE>And I'm betting if we test your keys,

993
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,770
<41-18,CASTLE>会找到安吉·桑塔纳摩托车上的材质
<41-18,CASTLE>we'll find metal from Angel Santana's motorcycle.

994
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,150
<41-18,CASTLE>你在车上刻了"午夜贱货"
<41-18,CASTLE>Where you scratched in "Late-night bitch."

995
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,580
<41-18,CASTLE>他跟我说了
<41-18,CASTLE>He told me...

996
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,670
<41-19,HANK>那晚他离开演播室前说的
<41-19,HANK>That night just before he left the studio...

997
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,380
<41-19,HANK>他听到维斯伯格说了什么
<41-19,HANK>How he'd heard Weisberg say

998
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,540
<41-19,HANK>不做出改变的话  他的事业就毁了
<41-19,HANK>they were gonna bury him unless he made a change.

999
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,310
<41-19,HANK>三十五年了  我一直支持他
<41-19,HANK>35 years, I had his back.

1000
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,090
<41-19,HANK>而他却像甩开众多前妻一样地甩开我
<41-19,HANK>He was gonna toss me aside like one of his ex-wives,

1001
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,100
<41-19,HANK>当着全国观众的面羞辱我
<41-19,HANK>humiliate me in front of the whole country.

1002
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,400
<41-19,HANK>我知道会有这一天  我发现了征兆
<41-19,HANK>I knew it was coming. I saw all the little signs,

1003
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,570
<41-19,HANK>大厅里的尴尬时分
<41-19,HANK>the awkward moments in the hall.

1004
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,060
<41-19,HANK>我把他和凯拉的照片发给他
<41-19,HANK>I sent him that picture of him and Kayla

1005
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,020
<41-19,HANK>是要提醒他  他有把柄在我手上
<41-19,HANK>to remind him of all the secrets I kept.

1006
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,640
<41-19,HANK>知道他说什么吗
<41-19,HANK>You know what he said?

1007
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,110
<41-19,HANK>丑闻只会让收视更红
<41-19,HANK>The scandal would only help his ratings.

1008
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,940
<41-20,BECKETT>你买了毒药
<41-20,BECKETT>You bought your poison

1009
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,840
<41-20,BECKETT>并且尾随他去了俱乐部
<41-20,BECKETT>and you followed him to the club.

1010
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,450
<41-21,HANK>他出来后我就当面质问他
<41-21,HANK>I confronted him when he came out.

1011
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,750
<41-21,HANK>我让他不要甩开我们的心血
<41-21,HANK>I told him not to throw away everything we'd built.

1012
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,500
<41-21,HANK>他说他帮不了我
<41-21,HANK>He told me he couldn't save me.

1013
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,890
<41-21,HANK>有没有他  维斯伯格都要走年轻化路线
<41-21,HANK>Weisberg was going younger with or without him.

1014
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,510
<41-22,CASTLE>既然你知道他无从选择
<41-22,CASTLE>Well, if you knew he didn't have a choice,

1015
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,310
<41-22,CASTLE>为什么要杀他
<41-22,CASTLE>why did you kill him?

1016
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,550
<41-23,HANK>因为他有选择
<41-23,HANK>Because he did have another choice.

1017
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,710
<41-23,HANK>玉石俱焚
<41-23,HANK>Go down with the ship!

1018
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,720
<41-23,HANK>我们一起体面地离开
<41-23,HANK>We both go out gracefully,

1019
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:30,460
<41-23,HANK>鲍比会有八千万的赔偿
<41-23,HANK>and Bobby gets 80 million bucks

1020
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:33,600
<41-23,HANK>这不比他陪小孩子耍猴戏强吗
<41-23,HANK>instead of him continuing the show with some kid.

1021
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,900
<41-23,HANK>我陪他做了四千多集节目
<41-23,HANK>I gave him over 4,000 shows,

1022
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,160
<41-23,HANK>无论他的笑话好笑与否
<41-23,HANK>laughing at every lousy joke he cracked,

1023
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,940
<41-23,HANK>我都卖力去笑
<41-23,HANK>whether they were funny or not.

1024
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,770
<41-23,HANK>上帝啊
<41-23,HANK>Jeez.

1025
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,270
<41-24,BECKETT>你是如何下手的
<41-24,BECKETT>So how did you manage it?

1026
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,970
<41-25,HANK>当我知道无法改变他的想法时
<41-25,HANK>When I knew I couldn't change his mind,

1027
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,250
<41-25,HANK>我告诉他
<41-25,HANK>I told him...

1028
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,390
<41-25,HANK>我能体谅他
<41-25,HANK>I understood.

1029
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,250
<41-25,HANK>我们走到西区大道
<41-25,HANK>We walked over to the West Side Highway,

1030
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,180
<41-25,HANK>坐在长椅上  看着海
<41-25,HANK>sat on a bench, looked out at the water,

1031
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,100
<41-25,HANK>回忆我们的辉煌岁月
<41-25,HANK>talked about what a great run we'd had.

1032
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,760
<41-25,HANK>然后我请他喝饮料
<41-25,HANK>Then I offered him a drink.

1033
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,840
<41-25,HANK>他是我最好的朋友
<41-25,HANK>He was my best friend.

1034
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,890
<41-25,HANK>对朋友下手...
<41-25,HANK>You don't do that to your friend.

1035
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,490
<42-1,CASTLE>又一个实例证明
<42-1,CASTLE>Yet another example of

1036
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,010
<42-1,CASTLE>工作与娱乐不能混淆
<42-1,CASTLE>why you shouldn't mix business with pleasure,

1037
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,420
<42-1,CASTLE>哪怕是娱乐工作
<42-1,CASTLE>even show business.

1038
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,600
<42-2,BECKETT>你是在说案子  还是说你自己
<42-2,BECKETT>Are you talking about the case or yourself?

1039
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,370
<42-3,CASTLE>一针见血啊  探长
<42-3,CASTLE>Touche, Detective.

1040
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,930
<42-4,BECKETT>要不要去享受一下胜利的汉堡
<42-4,BECKETT>So you want to go for a victory lap and grab a burger?

1041
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,330
<42-5,CASTLE>-不行  得走了  有约  -你开玩笑吧
<42-5,CASTLE>- Oh, can't. Gotta go. Big date. - You're kidding, right?

1042
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,900
<42-6,BECKETT>你还约那个艾丽·梦露
<42-6,BECKETT>You're going out with Ellie Monroe even though

1043
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,530
<42-6,BECKETT>明知道她对你唯一感兴趣的就是
<42-6,BECKETT>you know the only reason that she was interested in you

1044
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,640
<42-6,BECKETT>争取角色
<42-6,BECKETT>was for a part?

1045
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,000
<42-6,BECKETT>难道你已经拉下了所有的面子
<42-6,BECKETT>Have you lost all sense of human decency

1046
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,520
<42-6,BECKETT>抛弃了自尊  怎么了
<42-6,BECKETT>and self-res-- What?

1047
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,580
<42-7,CASTLE>我是与阿丽克西斯有约
<42-7,CASTLE>My big date... is with Alexis.
