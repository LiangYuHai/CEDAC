<2-2,CASTLE>Mm. Actually, sweetie, it's called The River.

32
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,660
<2-3,ALEXIS>没错
<2-3,ALEXIS>Right. Right.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,940
<2-3,ALEXIS>第五张公共牌叫"河牌圈"
<2-3,ALEXIS>The, uh, fifth community card is called "The river"

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,950
<2-3,ALEXIS>或者叫"第五圈"
<2-3,ALEXIS>or "Fifth street."

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,370
<2-4,CASTLE>你已经入门了  孩子
<2-4,CASTLE>Now you're on the trolley, kid.

<2-6,CASTLE>until the river.

39
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,750
<2-7,ALEXIS>你摸到了第三张杰克
<2-7,ALEXIS>Mm-hmm. And you got a third jack,

40
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,930
<2-7,ALEXIS>三张杰克比三张九要大
<2-7,ALEXIS>and trip Jacks beat trip 9s.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,990
<2-8,CASTLE>-你赢了  -别泄气  宝贝儿
<2-8,CASTLE>- You win. - Well, don't sweat it, sweetheart.

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,580
<2-8,CASTLE>这只是你的第一堂课而已
<2-8,CASTLE>Just your first lesson.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,370
<2-8,CASTLE>要不咱们今晚就玩到这里吧
<2-8,CASTLE>What do you say we call it a night?

<2-9,ALEXIS>什么  别  咱们继续
<2-9,ALEXIS>What? No. Let's keep playing.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,760
<2-10,MARTHA>这是干嘛呢
<2-10,MARTHA>Oh, what's all this?

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,630
<2-11,ALEXIS>老爸在教我无限额德州扑克的基本规则
<2-11,ALEXIS>Dad's teaching me the basics of no-limit texas hold'em.

48
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,700
<2-12,MARTHA>我太震惊了  竟然在赌博
<2-12,MARTHA>I'm shocked--shocked-- there's gambling in here.

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,360
<2-12,MARTHA>算我一个
<2-12,MARTHA>Deal me in.

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,970
<2-13,CASTLE>晚上好  贝克特探长
<2-13,CASTLE>Good evening, Detective Beckett.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,370
<2-14,ESPOSITO>死者名叫保罗·芬奇
<2-14,ESPOSITO>Victim's name is Paul Finch.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,930
<2-14,ESPOSITO>资料显示  这是他的车
<2-14,ESPOSITO>According to the registration, it's his car.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,170
<2-15,BECKETT>还有什么关于他的资料吗
<2-15,BECKETT>What do we know about him?

54
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,710
<2-16,ESPOSITO>我们查了一下他的亲属  找到了他妻子
<2-16,ESPOSITO>We ran him for next of kin, found his wife.

55
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,710
<2-17,RYAN>她正在赶来  还查到了他的犯罪记录
<2-17,RYAN>She's on her way in. And his rap sheet.

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,000
<2-18,ESPOSITO>他是个小偷
<2-18,ESPOSITO>He's a thief...

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,590
<2-18,ESPOSITO>劫过几间银行  还有几次联手入室抢劫
<2-18,ESPOSITO>Couple of bank jobs, some corporate B&Es.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,180
<2-18,ESPOSITO>但他已经好多年没有被逮着了
<2-18,ESPOSITO>But he hasn't been arrested in a few years.

59
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,440
<2-18,ESPOSITO>所以说  要么是他运气极佳
<2-18,ESPOSITO>So he's either really lucky...

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,530
<2-19,CASTLE>要么就是他金盆洗手了
<2-19,CASTLE>Or he's out of the game.

61
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,110
<2-20,BECKETT>死因是什么
<2-20,BECKETT>What happened?

62
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,520
<2-21,LANIE>他是被电刑致死的
<2-21,LANIE>I'd say he was electrocuted.

63
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,510
<2-22,BECKETT>从烧灼程度来看
<2-22,BECKETT>That had to be pretty high voltage

64
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,300
<2-22,BECKETT>电压一定很高
<2-22,BECKETT>for him to get burns like that.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,890
<2-23,CASTLE>当然了
<2-23,CASTLE>Well, sure.

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,500
<2-23,CASTLE>你只要把这些线路直接和点火系统相连
<2-23,CASTLE>You connect these leads directly into the ignition system,

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,970
<2-23,CASTLE>然后再让引擎高速转动就行
<2-23,CASTLE>you rev the engine high enough...

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,360
<2-24,BECKETT>看上去凶手是想拷问他
<2-24,BECKETT>Looks like they were trying to torture him,

69
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,610
<2-24,BECKETT>但结果却把他弄死了
<2-24,BECKETT>but ended up killing him instead.

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,650
<2-25,LANIE>不管怎样  都很痛苦
<2-25,LANIE>Either way, it wasn't pleasant.

71
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,140
<2-26,BECKETT>不管凶手是谁
<2-26,BECKETT>You know, whoever did this

72
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,110
<2-26,BECKETT>他不是想借此传递信息
<2-26,BECKETT>either wanted to send a message

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,730
<2-26,BECKETT>就是想从他这里得到什么
<2-26,BECKETT>or needed something from him.

74
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,590
<2-27,CASTLE>一个退休的小偷身上能有什么...
<2-27,CASTLE>What would somebody need from a retired...

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,610
<2-28,BECKETT>怎么了
<2-28,BECKETT>What?

76
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,330
<2-29,CASTLE>他的眼睛是闭着的
<2-29,CASTLE>His eyes are closed.

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,350
<2-30,BECKETT>你们来之前有人碰过尸体吗
<2-30,BECKETT>Did anyone touch the body before you came here?

78
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,560
<2-31,LANIE>没  我来的时候就这样了
<2-31,LANIE>Nope. It was like that when I got here.

79
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,490
<2-31,LANIE>一定是凶手在他死后帮他合上的
<2-31,LANIE>The killer must have closed 'em postmortem.

80
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,260
<2-32,BECKETT AND CASTLE>这意味着凶手认识死者
<2-32,BECKETT AND CASTLE>That means he knew the victim.

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,900
<2-33,CASTLE>我觉得他可能是对自己的行为心存愧疚
<2-33,CASTLE>I would say, he probably felt guilty about what he had done,

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,790
<2-33,CASTLE>想要抹去这种罪恶感
<2-33,CASTLE>wanted to erase it.

83
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,390
<2-34,BECKETT>让鉴证组检查一下车里
<2-34,BECKETT>Have C.S.U. sweep the cars,

84
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,350
<2-34,BECKETT>我们用烟熏处理一下尸体
<2-34,BECKETT>and let's fume the body.

85
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,670
<2-34,BECKETT>说不定能在他的眼皮上发现指纹
<2-34,BECKETT>Maybe we'll get some prints off of his eyelids.

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,960
<2-35,LANIE>好的
<2-35,LANIE>You got it.

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,640
<2-36,CASTLE>这是什么
<2-36,CASTLE>What is it?

88
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,360
<2-37,BECKETT>你看呢
<2-37,BECKETT>You tell me.

89
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,490
<2-38,CASTLE>也许杀他的凶手
<2-38,CASTLE>Maybe he was murdered by

90
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,940
<2-38,CASTLE>是 "王子"普林斯[美国歌手  使用类似标记作为自己的代号]
<2-38,CASTLE>the artist formerly known as Prince.

91
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,130
<3-1,BECKETT>芬奇太太  我们很同情您的遭遇
<3-1,BECKETT>Mrs. Finch, we're very sorry for your loss.

92
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,420
<3-1,BECKETT>这个东西
<3-1,BECKETT>Does this...

93
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,890
<3-1,BECKETT>你看着眼熟吗
<3-1,BECKETT>look familiar to you at all?

94
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,150
<2-17,RYAN>不  很抱歉
<2-17,RYAN>No, I'm sorry.

95
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,470
<2-18,ESPOSITO>我知道我丈夫曾是个什么样的人
<2-18,ESPOSITO>Look, I know what my husband was,

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,780
<2-19,CASTLE>但是保罗自从出狱以后就洗手不干了
<2-19,CASTLE>but Paul had been out of the game since he left prison.

97
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,870
<3-42,BECKETT>我们结婚时  他就发誓不再行窃
<3-42,BECKETT>When we got married, he swore off taking scores.

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,250
<3-43,CASTLE>直到几星期前
<3-43,CASTLE>Then a few weeks ago,

99
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,820
<3-1,BECKETT>他说他要帮朋友做点事
<3-1,BECKETT>he said he had to go do something for a friend.

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,390
<3-2,BECKETT>他有说是什么人或者做什么事吗
<3-2,BECKETT>Did he tell you what or who?

101
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,680
<7-31,RYAN>没有
<7-31,RYAN>No.

102
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,350
<7-32,ESPOSITO>我求他不要去做  但是他
<7-32,ESPOSITO>I begged him not to do it, but he...

103
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,600
<7-33,RYAN>他说他很久以前亏欠过这个人
<7-33,RYAN>He said he owed the guy from way back.

104
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,110
<7-34,ESPOSITO>探长  保罗是个小偷
<7-34,ESPOSITO>Paul was a thief, Detective,

105
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,600
<7-35,BECKETT>但他盗亦有道
<7-35,BECKETT>but he had this sense of honor.

106
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,840
<7-36,ESPOSITO>这一点上他是很传统的
<7-36,ESPOSITO>He was old-fashioned like that.

107
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,740
<7-37,CASTLE>他是个好人  探长
<7-37,CASTLE>He was a good man, Detective.

108
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,660
<7-38,ESPOSITO>我是说  谁都知道他曾犯过错
<7-38,ESPOSITO>I mean, god knows he had his faults,

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,280
<6-10,BECKETT>但是...这个
<6-10,BECKETT>But... this?

110
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,450
<3-1,BECKETT>他不该落得如此下场
<3-1,BECKETT>He didn't deserve this.

111
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,010
<3-2,BECKETT>这家伙为了做这件事重出江湖
<3-2,BECKETT>So the guy comes out of retirement

112
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,530
<3-3,CASTLE>结果却因此丧命
<3-3,CASTLE>for one job and ends up dead.

113
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,270
<3-3,CASTLE>这绝对不是巧合
<3-3,CASTLE>That cannot be a coincidence.

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,040
<3-4,ESPOSITO>没错  什么事能让一个退休多年的人
<3-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, what lures a guy who's been retired for years

115
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,960
<3-4,ESPOSITO>重操旧业呢
<3-4,ESPOSITO>back into the game?

116
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,750
<3-5,RYAN>肯定是件大事
<3-5,RYAN>Must've been something big.

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,440
<3-5,RYAN>刚才劫案组打电话过来
<3-5,RYAN>That was robbery on the phone.

118
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,350
<3-6,BECKETT>他们上报了前天发生的一起入室抢劫案
<3-6,BECKETT>They logged in a break-in at a branch of

119
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,790
<3-6,BECKETT>地点是曼哈顿互惠银行的一家分行
<3-6,BECKETT>Manhattan Mutual the day before yesterday.

120
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,270
<3-7,ESPOSITO>抢银行  这符合芬奇的犯罪记录
<3-7,ESPOSITO>Bank heist. That fits with finch's profile.

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,010
<3-8,CASTLE>-还有什么细节吗  -没有
<3-8,CASTLE>- Did they have any details? - Nope.

122
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,740
<3-9,BECKETT>他们正在派一个新人过来
<3-9,BECKETT>They're sending the new guy up now.

123
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,400

<3-11,ESPOSITO>Why didn't you tell me you transferred?

126

<3-19,CASTLE>没错
<3-19,CASTLE>That's right.

<3-21,DEMMING>- Yeah, we met. - Yes. Hi.

135
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,270
<3-22,BECKETT>你好
<3-22,BECKETT>Hi.

136
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,490
<3-23,DEMMING>言归正传  保罗·芬奇
<3-23,DEMMING>So Paul Finch, huh?

137
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,400
<3-23,DEMMING>他是这里为数不多的
<3-23,DEMMING>He's one of the few guys on the island

138
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,610
<3-23,DEMMING>用这种方法行窃的小偷之一
<3-23,DEMMING>who could've taken a score like that.

139
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,520
<3-24,BECKETT>哪种方法
<3-24,BECKETT>Like what?

140
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,050
<3-25,DEMMING>几个职业小偷打通了金库
<3-25,DEMMING>A couple of pros tunnel into the vault,

141
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,740
<3-25,DEMMING>钻开了一个保险箱
<3-25,DEMMING>drill open a safe deposit box,

142
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,460
<3-25,DEMMING>除了百露牌古龙水味道外  没留任何痕迹
<3-25,DEMMING>leave nothing behind but the great smell of Brut.

143
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,820
<3-26,BECKETT>你觉得芬奇不可能
<3-26,BECKETT>And you think that finch couldn't

144
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,810
<3-26,BECKETT>单靠一人之力做到这些吗
<3-26,BECKETT>have pulled this off on his own?

145
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,610
<3-27,DEMMING>不可能  这起码得两个人才能做到
<3-27,DEMMING>Nah, it's a 2-man job at the minimum.

146
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,800
<3-27,DEMMING>肯定还有另一个人在场
<3-27,DEMMING>There's definitely another player

147
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,110
<3-27,DEMMING>负责帮他望风
<3-27,DEMMING>floating around out there.

148
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,260
<3-28,BECKETT>我们已经着手调查
<3-28,BECKETT>Well, we've run a search

149
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,980
<3-28,BECKETT>他的通话记录和财务状况
<3-28,BECKETT>for his phone records and financials,

150
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,820
<3-28,BECKETT>但愿我们能找到
<3-28,BECKETT>so hopefully we'll find something

151
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,960
<3-28,BECKETT>把他和别人联系上的线索
<3-28,BECKETT>that ties him to a partner.

152
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,500
<3-29,CASTLE>说不定是芬奇的同伙在得手后背弃了他
<3-29,CASTLE>Or maybe the partner turned on Finch after the robbery,

153
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,280
<3-29,CASTLE>觉得他再也没有利用价值了
<3-29,CASTLE>decided he didn't need him anymore.

154
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,920
<3-30,BECKETT>不管怎样  可以肯定
<3-30,BECKETT>Either way, we know that

155
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,420
<3-30,BECKETT>抢劫案和杀人案是有联系的
<3-30,BECKETT>the robbery and the homicide are connected.

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,470
<3-31,CASTLE>为了偷一个保险箱如此大动干戈
<3-31,CASTLE>That seems like an awful lot of trouble

157
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,030
<3-31,CASTLE>未免也太麻烦了点吧
<3-31,CASTLE>for one safe deposit box.

158
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,340
<3-32,DEMMING>没错  而且里面还有几堆现金原封未动
<3-32,DEMMING>Yeah. And they left stacks of cash untouched.

159
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,230
<3-32,DEMMING>楼下的同事听说我接手这案子时
<3-32,DEMMING>The guys downstairs thought I was nuts

160
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,400
<3-32,DEMMING>都觉得我是个疯子
<3-32,DEMMING>when I hopped on this case,

161
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,700
<3-32,DEMMING>但我就是喜欢怪异的案子
<3-32,DEMMING>but I like the weird ones.

162
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,970
<3-33,ESPOSITO>那正好  贝克特也喜欢怪异的案子
<3-33,ESPOSITO>Hmm. How about that? Beckett likes the weird ones, too.

163
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,430
<3-34,RYAN>没错
<3-34,RYAN>Yeah.

164
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,360
<3-35,CASTLE>那箱子里究竟有什么东西
<3-35,CASTLE>What could be in that box

165
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,880
<3-35,CASTLE>值得让人又是打地道又是杀人呢
<3-35,CASTLE>that would be worth digging a tunnel to and killing for?

166
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,670
<3-35,CASTLE>钻石  德国无记名债券
<3-35,CASTLE>Diamonds? German bearer bonds?

167
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,750
<3-35,CASTLE>纳粹宝藏
<3-35,CASTLE>Nazi gold?

168
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,950
<3-36,DEMMING>这个我们目前还不知道
<3-36,DEMMING>Ah, we still don't know yet.

169
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,980
<3-36,DEMMING>银行联系失主时遇上点困难
<3-36,DEMMING>The bank had some trouble locating the owner,

170
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,510
<3-36,DEMMING>但他应该下午就会过来了
<3-36,DEMMING>but he's supposed to be coming in this afternoon.

171
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,740
<3-36,DEMMING>你愿不愿意和我一起进行审讯
<3-36,DEMMING>Would you like to join me for the interrogation?

<3-37,BECKETT>好啊  当然愿意
<3-37,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

<3-39,BECKETT>Meanwhile, I'm gonna need you guys to hit the street

175
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,640
<3-39,BECKETT>把和芬奇有联系的人统计一下
<3-39,BECKETT>and see if you can scare up any of Finch's associates--

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,570
<3-39,BECKETT>也许其中就有曾和他合伙盗窃的人
<3-39,BECKETT>Maybe anyone that he's taken scores with in the past

177
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,750

191
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,880
<3-50,DEMMING>银行工作人员说
<3-50,DEMMING>The folks at the bank said

<3-50,DEMMING>过去几天里
<3-50,DEMMING>they left you a half a dozen

<3-50,DEMMING>他们留了好几条言给你
<3-50,DEMMING>messages over the last couple of days.

<3-54,BECKETT>This stamp collection, how much was it worth exactly?

199
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,790
<3-55,CANA>这种东西很难去明码标价的
<3-55,CANA>Well, it's hard to put a price tag on an item like that

200
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,720
<3-55,CANA>因为这里面倾注了很多情感投资
<3-55,CANA>Because of, you know, the sentimental value.

201
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,020
<3-56,BECKETT>那还有谁知道你把邮票收在银行里
<3-56,BECKETT>And who else knew that you were keeping it at the bank?

206
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,730
<3-60,DEMMING>集邮就是收集邮票的意思  卡纳先生
<3-60,DEMMING>Philately is the study of stamps, Mr. Cana,

207
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,210
<3-60,DEMMING>如果你真是个收藏家  理应知道这个词的意思
<3-60,DEMMING>which you would know if you were, in fact, a collector.

208
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,820
<3-60,DEMMING>老实说吧  箱子里装的到底是什么
<3-60,DEMMING>Come on, Fred. What's really in the box, huh?

<3-61,CANA>我才懒得理你这套废话
<3-61,CANA>I don't have to take this crap.

211
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,670
<3-61,CANA>我可是受害者
<3-61,CANA>I'm the victim here.

<3-78,RYAN>All right? He's not worth it. Man...

235
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,140
<3-79,BECKETT>刚才那是搞的什么鬼
<3-79,BECKETT>What the hell was that all about?

236
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,830
<3-80,ESPOSITO>他是维克托·雷辛的手下
<3-80,ESPOSITO>He works for victor Racine.

237
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,640
<3-81,BECKETT>那又怎样
<3-81,BECKETT>So?

238
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,750
<3-82,ESPOSITO>维克托·雷辛杀了我的搭档
<3-82,ESPOSITO>Victor Racine killed my partner.

239
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,330
<3-82,ESPOSITO>他叫艾克  艾克·松顿
<3-82,ESPOSITO>His name was Ike. Ike Thornton.

240
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
<3-82,ESPOSITO>我在54分局的时候和他是搭档
<3-82,ESPOSITO>We partnered up back when I was at the 54th.

241
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,720
<4-1,ESPOSITO>我们当时在有组织犯罪调查组工作
<4-1,ESPOSITO>We worked the organized crime task force.

242
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,310
<4-1,ESPOSITO>维克托·雷辛是我们的目标人物
<4-1,ESPOSITO>Victor Racine was our target...

243
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,460
<4-1,ESPOSITO>直到某天  艾克没有来上班
<4-1,ESPOSITO>Until one day, Ike didn't come into work.

244
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,570
<4-1,ESPOSITO>他就好像失踪了一样
<4-1,ESPOSITO>It's like he just disappeared.

245
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,230
<4-1,ESPOSITO>更糟糕的是
<4-1,ESPOSITO>To make matters worse,

246
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,710
<4-1,ESPOSITO>内务处的人来找我们
<4-1,ESPOSITO>Internal Affairs came around here

247
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,740
<4-1,ESPOSITO>问了一堆问题  好像艾克已经被收买了一样
<4-1,ESPOSITO>asking all these questions, talking like ike had gone over,

248
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,840
<4-1,ESPOSITO>好像他在帮雷辛做事一样
<4-1,ESPOSITO>that he was working for Racine.

249
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,710
<4-1,ESPOSITO>这种事根本就是胡扯
<4-1,ESPOSITO>It was an absolute load of crap.

250
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,300
<4-1,ESPOSITO>几天过后
<4-1,ESPOSITO>Couple of days later,

251
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,820
<4-1,ESPOSITO>几个小孩在码头旁找到了艾克的车
<4-1,ESPOSITO>some kids found Ike's car out by the docks...

252
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,720
<4-1,ESPOSITO>弹痕累累  座位上全是血迹
<4-1,ESPOSITO>shot to hell, blood all over the seats.

253
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,210
<4-2,RYAN>完全是职业杀手的行事作风
<4-2,RYAN>All the hallmarks of a professional hit.

254
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,390
<4-3,ESPOSITO>没错  只是这事我们无法联系到雷辛身上
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, only we couldn't tie it back to Racine.

255
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,450
<4-3,ESPOSITO>他的手下把艾克的尸体丢了
<4-3,ESPOSITO>His guys had dumped Ike's body

256
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,950
<4-3,ESPOSITO>以致我们没法找到他
<4-3,ESPOSITO>so that we could never find it.

257
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,390
<4-3,ESPOSITO>这事过后  部门把整个行动都取消了
<4-3,ESPOSITO>The department shut down the whole operation after that.

258
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,740
<4-3,ESPOSITO>我就被调到了这里  但我可以肯定的是
<4-3,ESPOSITO>I transferred here. But I know one thing--

259
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,550
<4-3,ESPOSITO>如果弗雷德·卡纳有个保险箱
<4-3,ESPOSITO>If Fred Cana has a safe deposit box,

260
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,140
<4-3,ESPOSITO>肯定是为了雷辛保管东西的
<4-3,ESPOSITO>it's because he's holding something for Racine.

261
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,970
<4-3,ESPOSITO>里面装的肯定不是邮票
<4-3,ESPOSITO>And it ain't no stamps.

262
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,080
<4-4,BECKETT>他要血债血还
<4-4,BECKETT>He wants blood.

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,870
<4-5,DEMMING>这不奇怪  现在看来
<4-5,DEMMING>Well, I don't blame him. From the look of it,

264
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,400
<4-5,DEMMING>我想雷辛是因为芬奇偷他的东西杀了他
<4-5,DEMMING>I'm guessing Racine had Finch killed for stealing from him.

265
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,460
<4-6,BECKETT>这也解释了他为何要严刑拷打他
<4-6,BECKETT>Well, that explains why he was tortured--

266
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,640
<4-6,BECKETT>为了让他供出同党
<4-6,BECKETT>So he'd give up his partner.

267
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,560
<4-6,BECKETT>无论他们从保险箱里偷走了什么
<4-6,BECKETT>You know, whatever they stole from that safe deposit box,

268
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,030
<4-6,BECKETT>雷辛都非常想拿回来
<4-6,BECKETT>Racine wants it back bad.

269
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,910
<4-7,DEMMING>但是他是怎么发现是芬奇干的呢
<4-7,DEMMING>Yeah, but how did he get onto Finch in the first place?

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,700
<4-8,CASTLE>也许他认出了古露牌古龙水的味道
<4-8,CASTLE>Maybe he recognized the great smell of Brut.

271
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,090
<4-9,BECKETT>我确定雷辛是那种有耳目的人物
<4-9,BECKETT>I'm sure that Racine is the kind of guy who has his sources.

272
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,690
<4-10,DEMMING>那么你想让我们的集邮家
<4-10,DEMMING>So you like our stamp collector

273
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,320
<4-10,DEMMING>代替雷辛接受制裁
<4-10,DEMMING>for doing the deed on Racine's behalf?

274
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,900
<4-11,BECKETT>是啊  不过我们询问过
<4-11,BECKETT>Sure, except we called.

275
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,760
<4-11,BECKETT>他有目击证人能够证实他的不在场证明
<4-11,BECKETT>He has witnesses willing to corroborate his whereabouts.

276
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,650
<4-13,BECKETT>-他当然有  -我们没有其他证据了
<4-13,BECKETT>- Of course he does. - And we have no proof otherwise.

277
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,660
<4-14,DEMMING>说到证据  鉴证组刚送来犯罪现场
<4-14,DEMMING>Oh, speaking of which, they brought up the CSU report

278
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,130
<4-14,DEMMING>的报告  车子被擦拭过
<4-14,DEMMING>on the crime scene. The car was wiped down.

279
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,300
<4-14,DEMMING>除了芬奇和他妻子的指纹  找不到其他人的指纹
<4-14,DEMMING>Other than Finch and his wife, we got no usable prints.

280
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,980
<4-15,BECKETT>而且我们还不知道那个金属标志
<4-15,BECKETT>And we still don't have an ID on that metal symbol

281
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,050
<4-16,CASTLE>-代表什么 -同时"集邮家"有不在场证明
<4-16,CASTLE>- we found. - Meanwhile, our stamp collector has an alibi,

282
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,000
<4-16,CASTLE>我们现在没有证据
<4-16,CASTLE>and we currently have no evidence.

283
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,290
<4-16,CASTLE>下一步应该怎么办
<4-16,CASTLE>So what is our next step?

284
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,590
<4-17,BECKETT>我们和劫案的真正受害人谈谈
<4-17,BECKETT>We talk to the real victim of our robbery--

285
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,520
<4-17,BECKETT>维克托·雷辛先生
<4-17,BECKETT>Mr. Victor Racine.

286
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,720
<4-18,DEMMING>很大胆  我喜欢你的办案风格
<4-18,DEMMING>Bold. I like your style.

287
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,240
<4-19,CASTLE>什么  你认为他是那种
<4-19,CASTLE>What, you think he's the kind of guy

288
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,790
<4-19,CASTLE>随便就告诉你保险箱里是什么
<4-19,CASTLE>who's just gonna tell us what's in that box

289
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,620
<4-19,CASTLE>或是承认谋杀的人
<4-19,CASTLE>or maybe admit to killing the thief?

290
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,930
<4-20,BECKETT>学着点  卡塞尔  学着点
<4-20,BECKETT>Watch and learn, Castle. Watch and learn.

291
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,930
<5-1,RACINE>什么风把你们给吹过来了
<5-1,RACINE>To what do I owe this pleasure, huh?

292
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,270
<5-2,BECKETT>曼哈顿互惠银行的一个保险箱
<5-2,BECKETT>A safe deposit box at Manhattan Mutual

293
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,510
<5-2,BECKETT>昨晚被盗了  雷辛先生
<5-2,BECKETT>was broken into the other night, Mr. Racine.

294
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,880
<5-2,BECKETT>保险箱的主人是你的一位合作者  弗雷德·卡纳
<5-2,BECKETT>It was registered to an associate of yours-- Fred Cana.

295
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,340
<5-3,RACINE>真别说  现在世道真是不好
<5-3,RACINE>You don't say? What's this world coming to, huh?

296
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,460
<5-3,RACINE>卡纳先生声称保险箱里保存着
<5-3,RACINE>Mr. Cana claims that the box contained

297
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,980
<5-3,RACINE>他的邮票收藏
<5-3,RACINE>his stamp collection?

298
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,850
<5-3,RACINE>我从不知道卡纳先生会对我
<5-3,RACINE>Well, I've never known Mr. Cana to lie...

299
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,970
<5-3,RACINE>说谎
<5-3,RACINE>to me.

300
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,930
<5-4,BECKETT>我们相信保险箱里的东西
<5-4,BECKETT>Well, we believe that it held something

301
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,920
<5-4,BECKETT>可能要比邮票有价值  也许是你的东西
<5-4,BECKETT>a little bit more valuable-- maybe something of yours.

302
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,990
<5-5,RACINE>真的吗  为什么这么说
<5-5,RACINE>Oh, really? And why is that?

303
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,970
<5-6,BECKETT>因为涉嫌抢劫的一名嫌疑人
<5-6,BECKETT>Because one of the guys involved in the robbery

304
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,450
<5-6,BECKETT>昨晚被发现死于停车场
<5-6,BECKETT>was found murdered in a parking garage last night.

305
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,800
<5-7,CASTLE>事实上  芬奇先生在死前被拷打过
<5-7,CASTLE>Well, actually, Mr. Finch was tortured before he was killed.

306
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,160
<5-7,CASTLE>如果仅仅是偷了邮票
<5-7,CASTLE>Now why would someone do that

307
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,460
<5-7,CASTLE>为什么会有人拷打他
<5-7,CASTLE>if all he stole were stamps?

308
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,770
<5-9,BECKETT>你昨晚在哪里
<5-9,BECKETT>Where were you last night?

309
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,850
<5-9,BECKETT>在家
<5-9,BECKETT>Home.

310
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,470
<5-10,RACINE>我有全天随身保镖证明
<5-10,RACINE>And I have around-the-clock bodyguards...

311
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,610
<5-10,RACINE>我昨天的行踪
<5-10,RACINE>who can attest to my whereabouts,

312
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,750
<5-10,RACINE>不过你们并不觉得是我杀的芬奇
<5-10,RACINE>but you don't think I killed Finch.

313
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,320
<5-10,RACINE>你们认为我让手下干的
<5-10,RACINE>You assume I had somebody do it for me,

314
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,760
<5-10,RACINE>你们来这是为了
<5-10,RACINE>so you're here just to...

315
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,440
<5-10,RACINE>炫技  是不是
<5-10,RACINE>count coup, aren't you?

316
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,080
<5-11,DEMMING>抱歉  什么意思
<5-11,DEMMING>Sorry. What was that?

317
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,640
<5-12,CASTLE>是指平原印第安人把打斗中
<5-12,CASTLE>The Plains Indians considered it an act of bravery

318
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,440
<5-12,CASTLE>能够在不受伤的情况下接近对手并触摸对手
<5-12,CASTLE>to get close enough to one of their enemies

319
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,470
<5-12,CASTLE>-的行为视为勇敢  我的头发  -还不错
<5-12,CASTLE>- to touch him with a coup stick. Is my hair... - looks good.

320
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
<5-14,CASTLE>谢了
<5-14,CASTLE>Thanks.

321
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,440
<5-15,RACINE>保险箱里的东西
<5-15,RACINE>This item or items that were in the safety deposit box,

322
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,880
<5-15,RACINE>假设说很有价值
<5-15,RACINE>if they're so valuable,

323
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,650
<5-15,RACINE>你们为何不去全力捉拿芬奇先生
<5-15,RACINE>why aren't you out chasing down Mr. Finch's associate

324
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,450
<12-48,ESPOSITO>的那位搭档呢
<12-48,ESPOSITO>in this endeavor?

325
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,110
<5-14,CASTLE>毕竟  有句古话说的好
<5-14,CASTLE>After all, you know what the old saying is--

326
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,280
<5-15,RACINE>盗亦"无"道
<5-15,RACINE>no honor among thieves.

327
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,140
<5-16,CASTLE>瞧  我说什么来着  浪费时间
<5-16,CASTLE>See, what'd I say? Waste of time.

328
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,630
<5-17,DEMMING>干的漂亮  探长
<5-17,DEMMING>Well played, Detective.

329
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,800
<5-18,BECKETT>过奖了  探长
<5-18,BECKETT>Thank you, Detective.

330
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,500
<5-19,CASTLE>干的漂亮?  他全都否认了
<5-19,CASTLE>"Well played"? All he did was deny it.

331
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,660
<5-20,BECKETT>-从否认里可以得到很多信息  -比如说
<5-20,BECKETT>- Well, you can learn a lot from a denial. - Like what?

332
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,900
<5-22,DEMMING>比如说雷辛还没有找到芬奇的同伙
<5-22,DEMMING>Like Racine hasn't found Finch's partner yet.

333
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,250
<5-23,CASTLE>因为如果雷辛知道了同伙是谁或其下落
<5-23,CASTLE>Because Racine would never point us in that direction

334
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,040
<5-23,CASTLE>他是不会给我们指出这条线索的
<5-23,CASTLE>if he already knew who or where the partner was.

335
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,670
<5-24,DEMMING>他一定很想找到那个人
<5-24,DEMMING>He must want this guy pretty bad

336
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,650
<5-24,DEMMING>不惜让警察替他跑腿
<5-24,DEMMING>if he's willing to have the cops do his legwork for him.

337
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,190
<5-25,CASTLE>我们先找到芬奇的同伙对雷辛有什么好处
<5-25,CASTLE>How does it help Racine if we find Finch's partner first?

338
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,130
<5-26,DEMMING>雷辛人脉广泛  他不费吹灰之力
<5-26,DEMMING>Racine's connected. He'd have no trouble

339
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,680
<5-26,DEMMING>就可以找人在监狱干掉芬奇的同伙
<5-26,DEMMING>having Finch's partner killed in jail.

341
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,000
<5-27,BECKETT>好  我们马上到
<5-27,BECKETT>Okay. We'll be right there.

342
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,390
<5-27,BECKETT>蕾妮准备好烟熏尸体了
<5-27,BECKETT>Lanie's ready to fume the body.

343
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,240
<5-28,DEMMING>好吧  你们回停尸房
<5-28,DEMMING>All right, you guys head back to the morgue.

344
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,290
<5-28,DEMMING>我去看看芬奇财产状况的调查有什么结果
<5-28,DEMMING>I'm gonna go see if Finch's financials have come in yet.

345
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,330
<5-29,BECKETT>好的
<5-29,BECKETT>Okay.

346
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,890
<5-29,BECKETT>怎么了
<5-29,BECKETT>What?

347
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,610
<5-30,CASTLE>没事
<5-30,CASTLE>Nothing.

348
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,230
<6-1,CASTLE>这太酷了
<6-1,CASTLE>That is so cool.

349
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,690
<6-1,CASTLE>-我拍照你介意吗  -随便你
<6-1,CASTLE>- Do you mind if I take pictures? - Knock yourself out.

350
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,590
<6-2,LANIE>不过要是照片传到网上
<6-2,LANIE>But if any of them end up on the internet,

351
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,360
<6-2,LANIE>我会抓到你并痛扁一顿
<6-2,LANIE>I will hunt you down and hurt you.

352
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,880
<6-2,LANIE>那么
<6-2,LANIE>So...

353
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,870
<6-2,LANIE>和那位帅哥劫案探长怎么回事
<6-2,LANIE>What's with the handsome robbery detective?

354
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,770
<6-2,LANIE>戴明吗
<6-2,LANIE>Demming?

355
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,210
<6-3,BECKETT>我们只是一起办案  就这样
<6-3,BECKETT>Oh, we're just working the case together. That's all.

356
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,800
<6-4,LANIE>是啊  不过话说回来
<6-4,LANIE>Mm-hmm. But then again,

357
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,620
<6-4,LANIE>你和卡塞尔共事一年了
<6-4,LANIE>you have been working with castle for a year

358
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,440
<6-4,LANIE>什么都没发生
<6-4,LANIE>and not a damn thing has happened, so...

359
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,310
<6-4,LANIE>我们打赌来着
<6-4,LANIE>we had a pool going.

360
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,520
<6-4,LANIE>因为你们俩我赔了不少钱
<6-4,LANIE>I lost a lot of money on you two.

361
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,710
<6-5,CASTLE>伙计们
<6-5,CASTLE>You guys.

362
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,370
<6-6,BECKETT>凶手替被害人合眼时
<6-6,BECKETT>Yahtzee. The killer left a print

363
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,230
<6-6,BECKETT>留下了指纹  查一查
<6-6,BECKETT>when he closed our victim's eye. Let's run it.

364
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:30,890
<6-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<6-8,BECKETT>What?

365
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,820
<6-9,LANIE>指纹找到了匹配者
<6-9,LANIE>We got a match on the print,

366
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,270
<6-9,LANIE>不过匹配者已经死亡
<6-9,LANIE>but the guy it belongs to is dead.

367
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,760
<6-11,CASTLE>-不可能  -除非他是僵尸
<6-11,CASTLE>- But that's impossible. - Unless he's a zombie.

368
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,760
<6-12,LANIE>不是僵尸
<6-12,LANIE>Not a zombie.

369
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,770
<6-12,LANIE>是个警察
<6-12,LANIE>A cop.

370
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,970
<6-13,BECKETT>艾塞克
<6-13,BECKETT>Isaac...

371
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,090
<6-13,BECKETT>"艾克" 松顿
<6-13,BECKETT>"Ike" Thornton.

372
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,700
<6-14,CASTLE>-埃斯波西托以前的搭档  -他还活着
<6-14,CASTLE>- Esposito's old partner? - He's alive?

373
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,350
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我出席了他的葬礼
<7-1,ESPOSITO>I went to his funeral,

374
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,210
<7-1,ESPOSITO>和他的妻子握了手
<7-1,ESPOSITO>held his wife's hand.

375
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,780
<7-1,ESPOSITO>现在你告诉我他还活着
<7-1,ESPOSITO>And now you're telling me he's alive

376
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,470
<7-1,ESPOSITO>替雷辛卖命  谋杀了芬奇
<7-1,ESPOSITO>and working for Racine, that he murdered Finch?

377
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,040
<7-2,BECKETT>这是一出完美的人间蒸发
<7-2,BECKETT>It was the perfect disappearing act.

378
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,140
<7-2,BECKETT>他知道所有人都会认为
<7-2,BECKETT>He knew that everyone would think

379
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,700
<7-2,BECKETT>是雷辛派人杀了他
<7-2,BECKETT>that Racine had killed him

380
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,290
<7-2,BECKETT>并弃尸他处
<7-2,BECKETT>and dumped his body somewhere.

381
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,190
<7-3,ESPOSITO>他不会那样做的  那样对不起警徽也对不起我
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Nah, I don't see how he could do it, to the badge, to me?

382
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,370
<7-3,ESPOSITO>-我可以为他挡子弹  -埃斯波西托
<7-3,ESPOSITO>- I would've taken a bullet for him. - Esposito.

383
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,250
<7-4,MONTGOMERY>这位是内务处的霍利威尔督察
<7-4,MONTGOMERY>This is Lieutenant Holliwell from internal affairs.

384
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,630
<7-5,HOLLIWELL>我们见过
<7-5,HOLLIWELL>We've met.

385
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,470
<7-6,ESPOSITO>-你通知内务处了  -没有
<7-6,ESPOSITO>- You called I.A.? - No.

386
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,460
<7-8,MONTGOMERY>我为了保护你给他们打了电话
<7-8,MONTGOMERY>I called 'em for your protection.

387
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,240
<7-9,HOLLIWELL>抱歉  警探
<7-9,HOLLIWELL>I'm sorry, Detective.

388
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,800
<7-9,HOLLIWELL>我并不喜欢被证明是对的
<7-9,HOLLIWELL>I don't really enjoy being proved right.

389
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,310
<7-10,ESPOSITO>是啊  当然不会
<7-10,ESPOSITO>No, of course not.

390
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,450
<7-11,CASTLE>我想你是调查艾克·松顿失踪
<7-11,CASTLE>I take it you were the investigating officer

391
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,950
<7-11,CASTLE>-的那位警官  -没错
<7-11,CASTLE>- when Ike Thornton disappeared? - I was.

392
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,750
<7-13,BECKETT>你是怎么怀疑到他的
<7-13,BECKETT>And what put you onto him in the first place?

393
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,800
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>雷辛总是抢先我们一步
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>Racine was always one step ahead of us,

394
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,330
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>就好像他总是未卜先知
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>like he always knew what we were thinking.

395
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,040
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>没用多长时间我们就发现
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>It didn't take too much to figure out

396
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,900
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>有警察向他通风报信
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>that he was being tipped off by a cop.

397
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,530
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>幸好当时有位线人能够作证
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>Luckily, we had an informant at the time that confirmed it,

398
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,950
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>但是在我们缉捕松顿之前
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>but before we were able to arrest Thornton,

399
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,850
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>他失踪了
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>he disappeared.

400
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,130
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>很可能是发现我们要逮捕他
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>Most likely found out that we were coming for him.

401
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,590
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>找到他车的时候  我们就认为雷辛把他杀了
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>When we found his car, we just assumed Racine killed him.

402
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,700
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>看来是他把松顿拉入伙了
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>Looks like he brought him into the family instead.

403
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,920
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>松顿和你联系过吗
<7-14,HOLLIWELL>Has Thornton contacted you?

404
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,380
<7-15,ESPOSITO>什么意思  和我联系
<7-15,ESPOSITO>What do you mean, contacted me?

405
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,000
<7-16,RYAN>你在指控我拍档什么罪名
<7-16,RYAN>What exactly are you accusing my partner of?

406
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,960
<7-17,HOLLIWELL>-我没有指控  我是询问  -问什么
<7-17,HOLLIWELL>- I'm not accusing. I'm asking. - Asking what...

407
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,290
<7-18,ESPOSITO>我是否知道一切  是否参与其中
<7-18,ESPOSITO>If I knew all along, if I was part of it?

408
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,830
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>- 我没有  -这是个精心策划的骗局
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>- The answer's no. - It was such an elaborate hoax.

409
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,840
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>看起来需要
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>It seems like it would take

410
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,100
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>不少谋划和帮助
<7-19,HOLLIWELL>a little bit of planning, a little help.

411
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,090
<7-20,ESPOSITO>我已经告诉你了  我不知道
<7-20,ESPOSITO>I just told you, I didn't know.

412
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,290
<7-20,ESPOSITO>你想让我干嘛  要我测谎吗
<7-20,ESPOSITO>What do you want me to do, take a poly?

413
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,460
<7-21,HOLLIWELL>那你会接受测谎吗
<7-21,HOLLIWELL>Would you take a polygraph test?

414
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,740
<7-23,ESPOSITO>-等等  -如果这会让你不再纠缠我
<7-23,ESPOSITO>- Wait a minute-- - If it'll get you off my back.

415
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,630
<7-24,MONTGOMERY>-埃斯波西托 你不需要  -我想做
<7-24,MONTGOMERY>- Esposito, you don't have to do this. - I want to.

416
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,370
<7-26,HOLLIWELL>很好  我办公室  一小时后
<7-26,HOLLIWELL>Good. My office. One hour.

417
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,480
<7-27,RYAN>那家伙太过分了
<7-27,RYAN>That guy was out of line back there.

418
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,170
<7-28,ESPOSITO>如果在他的立场  我也会问同样的问题
<7-28,ESPOSITO>I'd be asking the same questions if I was in his shoes.

419
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,260
<7-29,RYAN>你可以和我谈谈
<7-29,RYAN>You know you can talk to me, right?

420
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,910
<7-30,ESPOSITO>我把那一切都忘了  兄弟
<7-30,ESPOSITO>I put all that stuff behind me, bro.

421
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,790
<7-30,ESPOSITO>我留下唯一的纪念
<7-30,ESPOSITO>The only thing I have left from back then...

422
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,510
<7-30,ESPOSITO>就是这个
<7-30,ESPOSITO>is this right here.

423
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,540
<7-30,ESPOSITO>那时候  我还在54分局
<7-30,ESPOSITO>Back in the day, when I was in the 54th,

424
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,230
<7-30,ESPOSITO>每个人都戴着一个
<7-30,ESPOSITO>everybody used to carry one of these with 'em.

425
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,810
<7-30,ESPOSITO>是自豪的象征  知道吗
<7-30,ESPOSITO>It was like a sense of pride, you know?

426
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,050
<7-31,RYAN>艾克也有一个
<7-31,RYAN>Ike had one of those?

427
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,520
<7-32,ESPOSITO>是啊  怎么了
<7-32,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Why?

428
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,570
<7-33,RYAN>让我看看
<7-33,RYAN>Let me see it.

429
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,440
<7-33,RYAN>54分局
<7-33,RYAN>The 54th.

430
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,660
<7-33,RYAN>肯定是他和芬奇搏斗的时候弄断的
<7-33,RYAN>It must have broken off when he was struggling with Finch.

431
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,410
<7-34,ESPOSITO>真是他
<7-34,ESPOSITO>It was him.

432
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,810
<7-35,BECKETT>如果你退出这案子
<7-35,BECKETT>You know no one would blame you

433
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,650
<7-35,BECKETT>没人会怪你
<7-35,BECKETT>if you stepped off this case.

434
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,430
<7-35,BECKETT>不
<7-35,BECKETT>No.

435
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,690
<7-36,ESPOSITO>不管是不是搭档
<7-36,ESPOSITO>Partner or not...

436
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,160
<7-36,ESPOSITO>他都杀了人
<7-36,ESPOSITO>he killed a man.

437
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,560
<7-37,CASTLE>这家伙这些年活得像幽灵般
<7-37,CASTLE>This guy's pulled a ghost routine for years--

438
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,740
<7-37,CASTLE>放弃了他原来的生活  他的朋友
<7-37,CASTLE>gave up his old life, his friends.

439
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,450
<7-37,CASTLE>如果没人帮忙  他不可能
<7-37,CASTLE>A guy can't pull a disappearing act like that

440
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,500
<7-38,ESPOSITO>-凭空消失  -他有雷辛的帮助
<7-38,ESPOSITO>- without help from somebody. - He had Racine's help.

441
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,640
<7-39,CASTLE>有没有雷辛他都结婚了  是吧  有孩子
<7-39,CASTLE>Well, Racine or no Racine, he was married, right, has a kid?

442
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,330
<7-39,CASTLE>他们一定知道
<7-39,CASTLE>They must have known.

443
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,790
<7-40,ESPOSITO>上个月见过卡萝  她毫不知情
<7-40,ESPOSITO>I saw Carol last month. She doesn't know anything.

<7-42,ESPOSITO>见鬼  我什么都不确定了
<7-42,ESPOSITO>Hell, I'm not sure about anything anymore.

<7-46,CAROL THORNTON>I'm sorry. I don't believe you.

<7-47,BECKETT>他活着  别无他解
<7-47,BECKETT>He's alive. There's no other explanation.

452
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,060
<7-48,CAROL>他们没找到艾克的尸体  我不知道
<7-48,CAROL>Well, they never recovered Ike's body, so I don't know.

453
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,590
<7-48,CAROL>可能有人把他的拇指砍了下来
<7-48,CAROL>Someone could've cut off his thumb and--

454
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,850
<7-49,CASTLE>是啊  可能是那样  不过你知道不是
<7-49,CASTLE>Yes, they could've done that, but you know they didn't.

455

<7-49,CASTLE>拜托  卡萝  这么多年
<7-49,CASTLE>Come on, Carol. It's been years.

456
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,690
<7-49,CASTLE>像你这么漂亮的女人怎么会找不到伴侣
<7-49,CASTLE>An attractive woman like you hasn't found someone new?

457
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,430
<7-50,CAROL>对单亲妈妈来说并非易事
<7-50,CAROL>It's not easy when you're a single mom.

458
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,650
<7-50,CAROL>这些都和你们无关
<7-50,CAROL>Not that that's any of your business.

459
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,960
<7-50,CAROL>你们知道警察
<7-50,CAROL>You know what you get

460
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,810
<7-50,CAROL>在被通缉的时候去世会得到什么吗
<7-50,CAROL>when a cop dies with a warrant out on him?

<7-50,CAROL>告诉你们不会得到什么吧
<7-50,CAROL>Well, I'll tell you what you don't get.

<7-51,BECKETT>你还是有办法支付抵押贷款
<7-51,BECKETT>somehow manage to make mortgage payments--

465
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,680
<7-52,CAROL>如果艾克活着  就意味着我们还是夫妻
<7-52,CAROL>If Ike is alive, that means we're still married.

466
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,000
<7-52,CAROL>你们不能强迫我作对我丈夫不利的证词
<7-52,CAROL>And you can't compel me to testify against my spouse.

467
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,650
<7-53,CASTLE>她知道他还活着  但是她知不知道
<7-53,CASTLE>She knew he was alive, but did she know

468
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,940
<7-53,CASTLE>他在为雷辛卖命呢
<7-53,CASTLE>he was working for Racine?

469
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,810
<7-54,BECKETT>她是个警察的妻子  她知道自己的权利
<7-54,BECKETT>She's a cop wife and she knows her rights.

470
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,270
<7-54,BECKETT>从她嘴里别想套出什么
<7-54,BECKETT>Good luck getting anything out of her.

00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,710
<7-55,ESPOSITO>她也许会跟我谈
<7-55,ESPOSITO>She might talk to me.

472
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,720
<7-56,RYAN>看看谁通过了测谎
<7-56,RYAN>Oh. Look who passed his poly.

<7-57,ESPOSITO>Had the feeling that Holliwell was kinda disappointed.

<7-57,ESPOSITO>She knows me.

475
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,240
<7-57,ESPOSITO>我可能会让她开口
<7-57,ESPOSITO>I might be able to get her to open up.

<7-58,BECKETT>好吧  早上去她家一趟

<7-58,BECKETT>我派一个小队去她的住所监视
<7-58,BECKETT>And I'll get a unit down to the house

478
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,030
<7-58,BECKETT>-以防艾克现身  -好吧
<7-58,BECKETT>- in case Ike decides to show up. - Right.

479

<7-60,CASTLE>sounds like my first marriage.

481

<7-61,BECKETT>-怎么了  -我在想
<7-61,BECKETT>- What? - I'm trying to figure out

<7-61,BECKETT>what was so damn important in that safe deposit box

483
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,900

<7-61,BECKETT>that Finch and his partner would risk their lives that way.

484
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,090
<7-62,CASTLE>你给谁打电话

<7-67,DEMMING>Esposito told me about Ike.

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,650
<10-2,BECKETT>-没事  我不累  -了解
<10-2,BECKETT>- That's okay. I think I can handle it. - Oh, I get it.

551
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,110
<10-3,DEMMING>你喜欢掌握主动权
<10-3,DEMMING>You don't want to give up the driver's seat.

552
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,210
<10-4,CASTLE>我买了咖啡
<10-4,CASTLE>Hey, I brought coffee.

553
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,440
<10-5,BECKETT>不用了
<10-5,BECKETT>Uh, you know what? It's okay.

554
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,920
<10-5,BECKETT>戴明已经买了
<10-5,BECKETT>Demming already brought some.

555
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,160
<10-6,CASTLE>是吗
<10-6,CASTLE>Did he now?

556
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,070
<10-7,DEMMING>我
<10-7,DEMMING>I...

557
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,540
<10-8,CASTLE>看  保罗·芬奇
<10-8,CASTLE>Hey, Paul Finch.

558
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,320
<10-9,DEMMING>没错  他在观察环境
<10-9,DEMMING>Oh, yeah. He's casing the place.

559
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,620
<10-10,BECKETT>-看看他的拍档是谁  -他妻子莫妮卡
<10-10,BECKETT>- And look who his partner is. - That's his wife Monica.

560
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,400
<10-11,CASTLE>她明明说自己毫不知情
<10-11,CASTLE>She said she had no idea what he was doing.

561
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,350
<10-12,DEMMING>还有人跟他们一伙的
<10-12,DEMMING>There's someone else with 'em.

562
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,950
<10-13,CASTLE>那是
<10-13,CASTLE>That's...

563
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,560
<10-13,CASTLE>艾克·松顿
<10-13,CASTLE>Ike Thornton.

564
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,270
<10-14,BECKETT>如果他为雷辛干活
<10-14,BECKETT>If he's working for racine,

565
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,640
<10-14,BECKETT>那他与芬奇一起干什么
<10-14,BECKETT>what's he doing with finch?

566
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,300
<10-15,ESPOSITO>艾克和芬奇是一伙的
<10-15,ESPOSITO>So ike was working with finch?

567
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,930
<10-16,DEMMING>看来是的  我想他是发现
<10-16,DEMMING>Yeah, it looks that way. I'm guessing he discovered

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,970
<10-16,DEMMING>雷辛将一些有价值的东西放在保险箱
<10-16,DEMMING>racine was keeping something valuable in the box.

569
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,800
<10-16,DEMMING>他需要芬奇的帮助来得到它
<10-16,DEMMING>He needed finch's skills to help him get it.

570
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,020
<10-17,ESPOSITO>如果他们一起干活  那他为何杀了他
<10-17,ESPOSITO>But if they were working together,why would he kill him?

571
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,130
<10-18,CASTLE>也许雷辛是对的
<10-18,CASTLE>Maybe racine was right.

572
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,780
<10-18,CASTLE>真的是盗亦"无"道
<10-18,CASTLE>Maybe there is no honor amongst thieves.

573
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,040
<10-19,ESPOSITO>也许不是他做的
<10-19,ESPOSITO>And maybe he didn't do it.

574
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,100
<10-20,BECKETT>我们有他在现场的证据
<10-20,BECKETT>We have him at the scene.

575
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,720
<10-21,ESPOSITO>他和芬奇是一伙的  他妻子没和盘托出
<10-21,ESPOSITO>Him working with finch, what his wife said, it doesn't add.

576
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,900
<10-21,ESPOSITO>肯定另有内幕
<10-21,ESPOSITO>Something else is going on.

577
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,500
<10-22,CASTLE>看来我们很快会知道
<10-22,CASTLE>Looks like we're about to find out what.

578
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,990
<11-1,BECKETT>是这样  莫妮卡  我们没兴趣
<11-1,BECKETT>Here's the thing, Monica, we're not interested

579
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,170
<11-1,BECKETT>了解你是否帮你丈夫到银行踩点
<11-1,BECKETT>in whether you helped your husband case the bank.

580
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,960
<11-1,BECKETT>我们只想找出杀人凶手
<11-1,BECKETT>All we care about is finding the guy who killed him--

581
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,210
<11-1,BECKETT>艾克·松顿
<11-1,BECKETT>Ike thornton.

582
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,670
<11-2,MONICA>你们认为是艾克·松顿杀了保罗
<11-2,MONICA>You think Ike Thornton killed Paul?

583
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,690
<11-2,MONICA>让我告诉你艾克是怎样的人
<11-2,MONICA>Let me tell you the kind of man Ike is.

584
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,860
<11-2,MONICA>十二年前  他逮捕了抢劫的保罗
<11-2,MONICA>About 12 years back, he collared Paul

585
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
<11-2,MONICA>和他弟弟巴利
<11-2,MONICA>and his kid brother Barry on a heist.

586
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,410
<11-2,MONICA>艾克看在巴利是初犯  放过了他
<11-2,MONICA>Ike saw that Barry was a first-timer, so he cut him a break.

587
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,710
<11-2,MONICA>保罗坐了五年牢
<11-2,MONICA>Paul went to jail for five years,

588
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,680
<11-2,MONICA>却从没忘记艾克的恩情
<11-2,MONICA>but he never forgot what Ike did for his brother.

589
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,830
<11-2,MONICA>所以他才为艾克出山  为了谢恩
<11-2,MONICA>That's why he did this last job with him, as payback.

590
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,270
<11-3,BECKETT>谢恩害了他  我们在你丈夫身上
<11-3,BECKETT>Well, payback's a bitch, because we found

591
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,580
<11-3,BECKETT>找到艾克的指纹
<11-3,BECKETT>Ike's fingerprints on your husband's body.

592
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,730
<11-4,MONICA>我不信
<11-4,MONICA>I don't believe it.

593
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,780
<11-5,BECKETT>你不信没关系
<11-5,BECKETT>It doesn't matter if you don't believe it.

594
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,090
<11-5,BECKETT>但事实是艾克当时在场
<11-5,BECKETT>The fact is, Ike was there.

595
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,010
<11-5,BECKETT>他折磨并杀死了你丈夫
<11-5,BECKETT>He tortured and killed your husband.

596
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,170
<11-5,BECKETT>保险箱里有什么
<11-5,BECKETT>What was in the box, Monica?

597
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,230
<11-6,DEMMING>他们从雷辛那里偷走了什么
<11-6,DEMMING>What did they steal from Racine?

598
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,740
<11-6,DEMMING>一定是价值连城的东西  所以艾克
<11-6,DEMMING>It must have been pretty valuable if Ike decided

599
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,840
<11-6,DEMMING>为了避免分赃才把你丈夫杀了
<11-6,DEMMING>to kill your husband so he wouldn't have to split it.

600
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,400
<11-7,MONICA>分赃  根本没什么好分的
<11-7,MONICA>Split it? There was nothing to split.

601
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,420
<11-8,CASTLE>保险箱里到底是什么
<11-8,CASTLE>What was in the box?

602
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,410
<11-9,MONICA>一本册子  一本账簿
<11-9,MONICA>A book. A ledger.

603
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,240
<11-10,BECKETT>一本账簿
<11-10,BECKETT>A ledger?

604
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,360
<11-11,MONICA>上面记录了雷辛的所有资产状况
<11-11,MONICA>Something that showed all of racine's pays and owes

605
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,790
<11-11,MONICA>包括不合法的部分
<11-11,MONICA>on all of his businesses, not just his legitimate ones.

606
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,790
<11-12,CASTLE>一本记录了雷辛非法经营状况的
<11-12,CASTLE>An accounting of all of Racine's illegal operations

607
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,640
<11-12,CASTLE>账簿很有勒索的价值
<11-12,CASTLE>could be worth a bundle in blackmail.

608
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,130
<11-13,MONICA>如果到手了当然很有价值
<11-13,MONICA>It could if they'd gotten it,

609
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,220
<11-13,MONICA>但当他们进入银行后却发现保险箱是空的
<11-13,MONICA>but when they hit the bank, the box was empty.

610
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,990
<11-14,DEMMING>空的
<11-14,DEMMING>Empty?

611
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,880
<11-15,MONICA>账簿不在里面
<11-15,MONICA>The ledger wasn't there.

612
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,490
<12-1,CASTLE>所以这个人为了偷老板的账簿
<12-1,CASTLE>So a guy tortures and kills his partner

613
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,340
<12-1,CASTLE>决定抢银行
<12-1,CASTLE>after breaking into a bank

614
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,300
<12-1,CASTLE>结果扑个空  之后他折磨并杀了同伙
<12-1,CASTLE>to steal something from his boss that wasn't actually there.

615
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,550
<12-2,DEMMING>听你这么说是挺疯狂
<12-2,DEMMING>Well, it sounds crazy when you say it like that.

616
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,180
<12-3,ESPOSITO>听着  他曾是我的拍档
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Look, I know he was my partner,

617
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,040
<12-3,ESPOSITO>但不管我怎么看
<12-3,ESPOSITO>but no matter how I slice it,

618
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,870
<12-3,ESPOSITO>人都不像是艾克杀的
<12-3,ESPOSITO>it makes no sense that Ike would kill Finch.

619
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,470
<12-5,BECKETT>-贝克特探长  -霍利维尔督察
<12-5,BECKETT>- Detective Beckett. - Lieutenant Holliwell.

620
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,500
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>抱歉打断你们  但我的人一直在
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>Sorry to interrupt, but my team's been up on a wire

621
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,240
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>监听雷辛组织里
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>monitoring the cell phones of

622
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,040
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>几个关键人物的手机
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>several key members of Racine's organization.

623
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,520
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>我们在留意是否有人提及艾克·松顿
<12-6,HOLLIWELL>We've been listening for any mention of Ike Thornton.

624
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,060
<12-7,BECKETT>然后呢
<12-7,BECKETT>And?

625
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,790
<12-8,HOLLIWELL>看来并不只有我们在找艾克·松顿
<12-8,HOLLIWELL>And it turns out, we're not the only ones looking for him.

626
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,560
<12-8,HOLLIWELL>雷辛刚出高价买下松顿的人头
<12-8,HOLLIWELL>Racine just put a price on Thornton's head.

627
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
<12-9,BECKETT>雷辛一定是发现他在追查账簿的事
<12-9,BECKETT>Racine must have found out he was going after the ledger.

628
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,350
<12-10,HOLLIWELL>我想你不是唯一一个被你拍档背叛的人
<12-10,HOLLIWELL>I guess you're not the only one your old partner betrayed.

629
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,050
<12-12,BECKETT>-卡萝有危险  -你去哪里
<12-12,BECKETT>- Carol. - Where you going?

630
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,710
<12-13,ESPOSITO>如果雷辛要追杀艾克  他会先去
<12-13,ESPOSITO>If racine's going after Ike, the first place he's gonna go

631
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,580
<12-13,ESPOSITO>艾克的家  他的妻儿有危险
<12-13,ESPOSITO>is the same place we went, his wife and kid.

632
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,800
<12-14,BECKETT>-莱恩  跟上  -好
<12-14,BECKETT>- Ryan. - Yeah.

633
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,690
<12-16,BECKETT>我马上通知监视小分队
<12-16,BECKETT>I'm gonna call the surveillance team.

634
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,670
<12-17,ESPOSITO>卡萝
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Carol!

635
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,830
<12-17,ESPOSITO>卡萝  是我哈维
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Carol, it's Javi!

636
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,650
<12-17,ESPOSITO>卡萝
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Carol!

637
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,750
<12-17,ESPOSITO>蒂姆
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Timmy!

638
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,570
<12-17,ESPOSITO>上楼看看  去
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Upstairs. Go.

639
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,860
<12-17,ESPOSITO>卡萝
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Carol!

640
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,280
<12-17,ESPOSITO>蒂姆
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Timmy!

641
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,270
<12-18,RYAN>没人
<12-18,RYAN>Nothing.

642
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,670
<12-19,ESPOSITO>他们走了
<12-19,ESPOSITO>They're gone.

643
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,150
<12-20,RYAN>监视人员说他们没离开过
<12-20,RYAN>Surveillance team said they never left.

644
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,870
<12-20,RYAN>-他们是怎么  -雷辛做的
<12-20,RYAN>- How the hell did they-- - Racine.

645
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,470
<12-21,ESPOSITO>让警员盘问下周围的邻居
<12-21,ESPOSITO>Have the uniforms canvass the neighbors.

646
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,160
<12-21,ESPOSITO>-可能会有目击者  -这就去
<12-21,ESPOSITO>- Maybe somebody saw something. - Yeah, on it.

647
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:16,640
<12-23,IKE>哈维  谢谢你为我儿子做的一切
<12-23,IKE>I appreciate what you done for my boy, Javi.

648
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,080
<12-24,ESPOSITO>卡萝和蒂姆呢  他们在哪里
<12-24,ESPOSITO>Carol and Tim... where are they?

649
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,280
<12-25,IKE>他们在雷辛找不到的地方
<12-25,IKE>Somewhere where Racine can't find 'em.

650
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,580
<12-26,ESPOSITO>我们有同事每周全天候守在这里
<12-26,ESPOSITO>We've had guys on this place 24/7.

651
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,670
<12-26,ESPOSITO>你是怎么进来的
<12-26,ESPOSITO>How the hell did you get in here?

652
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,450
<12-27,IKE>做了三年的隐形人  我来去如风
<12-27,IKE>Three years as a ghost, you learn a few things.

653
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,340
<12-28,ESPOSITO>所以内务处是对的
<12-28,ESPOSITO>So I.A. was right...

654
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,690
<12-28,ESPOSITO>三年前是对的
<12-28,ESPOSITO>Three years ago...

655
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,510
<12-28,ESPOSITO>现在也是
<12-28,ESPOSITO>Now.

656
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,830
<12-28,ESPOSITO>你为雷辛卖命
<12-28,ESPOSITO>You were working for Racine.

657
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,770
<12-29,IKE>你也这么认为吗
<12-29,IKE>Is that what you believe?

658
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,780
<12-30,ESPOSITO>你让我以为你死了
<12-30,ESPOSITO>You let me think you were dead.

659
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,100
<12-30,ESPOSITO>而现在你把枪口对着我
<12-30,ESPOSITO>And now you're holding a burner on me.

660
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,990
<12-31,IKE>哈维  你是一个好警察
<12-31,IKE>You're a good cop, Javi.

661
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
<12-31,IKE>如果我放下枪  你会抓我
<12-31,IKE>But I put this down, you gon' take me in.

662
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,240
<12-31,IKE>我不能让你这样做  还不到时候
<12-31,IKE>And I can't let you do that, not yet,

663
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,630
<12-32,ESPOSITO>-我们已经很接近了  -接近什么
<12-32,ESPOSITO>- not when I'm so close. - So close to what?

664
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,610
<12-33,IKE>警队里有人接受了雷辛的贿赂
<12-33,IKE>There is a dirty cop on Racine's payroll.

665
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,040
<12-33,IKE>为了掩护自己人  雷辛陷害了我
<12-33,IKE>So in order to throw them off his guy, Racine dirtied me up.

666
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,400
<12-33,IKE>而内务处完全相信这个说法
<12-33,IKE>And I.A. bought it hook, line and sinker.

667
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,660
<12-34,ESPOSITO>你为什么不对我说
<12-34,ESPOSITO>Why didn't you just come to me?

668
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,620
<12-35,IKE>兄弟  你知情的话你也会遭毒手
<12-35,IKE>Look, cases like mine are contagious, brother.

669
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,870
<12-35,IKE>我不能让你重蹈我的覆辙
<12-35,IKE>I couldn't let you catch what I had.

670
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,100
<12-35,IKE>雷辛的内应给了内务处虚假证据
<12-35,IKE>Racine's guy fed them so much garbage,

671
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,520
<12-35,IKE>好让他们把我抓起来
<12-35,IKE>they could lock me up.

672
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,860
<12-35,IKE>如果我真被抓起来了
<12-35,IKE>And if I had let 'em,

673
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,070
<12-35,IKE>在我为自己洗清罪名之前
<12-35,IKE>Racine woulda had me shanked at Rikers

674
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,280
<12-35,IKE>雷辛早就派人在赖克斯岛把我干掉了[纽约市监狱所在地]
<12-35,IKE>before I could clear my name.

675
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,580
<12-36,ESPOSITO>-这段时间你去哪了  -在一旁观察学习
<12-36,ESPOSITO>- Where you been? - Watching, learning.

676
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,250
<12-37,IKE>所以我才能找到账簿
<12-37,IKE>That's how I found out about the ledger.

677
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,250
<12-38,ESPOSITO>-雷辛的资产状况  -上面记录着
<12-38,ESPOSITO>- Racine's pays and owes. - Everyone on his payroll,

678
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,240
<12-39,IKE>所有交易  包括陷害我的那名坏警察的
<12-39,IKE>including the dirty cop that set me up.

679
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,190
<12-40,ESPOSITO>但账簿并不如你设想般放在银行
<12-40,ESPOSITO>But the ledger wasn't in the bank like you thought.

680
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,220
<12-41,IKE>雷辛通过一些途径找到芬奇
<12-41,IKE>Somehow, Racine found finch.

681
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,070
<12-42,ESPOSITO>你也在场  我们找到了你的指纹
<12-42,ESPOSITO>You were there, man. We found your prints.

682
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,580
<12-43,IKE>哈维  我找到他时他已经死了
<12-43,IKE>He was dead when I found him, Javi.

683
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,690
<12-43,IKE>我只是帮他合上眼  兄弟相信我
<12-43,IKE>I just closed his eyes. Come on, man.

684
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,720
<12-44,ESPOSITO>那账簿呢
<12-44,ESPOSITO>And the ledger?

685
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,380
<12-45,IKE>我知道账簿在哪里
<12-45,IKE>I know where the ledger is.

686
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,750
<12-45,IKE>哈维  但我需要多点时间
<12-45,IKE>But I need a little more time, Javi.

687
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,720
<12-45,IKE>只要等到明晚
<12-45,IKE>Just until tomorrow night.

688
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,450
<12-46,ESPOSITO>你以前一直把徽章带在身边
<12-46,ESPOSITO>You used to carry yours with you all the time.

689
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,140
<12-47,IKE>我现在也是
<12-47,IKE>I still do, man.

690
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,270
<12-48,ESPOSITO>这表示杀人的另有其人
<12-48,ESPOSITO>Then that means there's somebody else mixed up in this,

691
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,440
<12-48,ESPOSITO>54分局的人
<12-48,ESPOSITO>somebody from the 54th.

692
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,630
<12-49,IKE>不管是谁  是他告诉雷辛我还活着
<12-49,IKE>Whoever it is, they tipped Racine that I'm still alive,

693
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,910
<12-49,IKE>也就是说他们就在身边
<12-49,IKE>which means they're close.

694
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,550
<12-49,IKE>可能是调查此案的一份子
<12-49,IKE>Maybe a part of your investigation.

695
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,110
<12-50,ESPOSITO>54分局
<12-50,ESPOSITO>54th.

696
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,210
<12-50,ESPOSITO>戴明
<12-50,ESPOSITO>Demming.

697
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,300
<13-1,ESPOSITO>是他
<13-1,ESPOSITO>It's him.

698
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,500
<13-2,RYAN>肯定是他
<13-2,RYAN>Gotta be.

699
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,040
<13-2,RYAN>还记得他说是自己要的这个案子吗
<13-2,RYAN>Remember how he said he requested this case?

700
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,200
<13-2,RYAN>说他酷爱离奇案件
<13-2,RYAN>Said he liked the weird ones,

701
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,670
<13-2,RYAN>其实是为了替雷辛
<13-2,RYAN>but it was just so he could hunt down

702
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,210
<13-2,RYAN>找出窃贼
<13-2,RYAN>the thieves for Racine.

703
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,030
<13-3,CASTLE>我早发现他不招人喜欢了
<13-3,CASTLE>I knew there was something I didn't like about him.

704
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,870
<13-3,CASTLE>长的太帅了
<13-3,CASTLE>Too pretty.

705
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,860
<13-3,CASTLE>他肯定上瑜伽课就为了
<13-3,CASTLE>Bet he takes yoga classes

706
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,970
<13-3,CASTLE>-勾引女孩子  -这些年来
<13-3,CASTLE>- just so he can pick up girls.  - All these years,

707
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,280
<13-4,ESPOSITO>他拿着雷辛的钱
<13-4,ESPOSITO>he's been lining his pockets with Racine's cash,

708
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,780
<13-4,ESPOSITO>却让松顿替他背黑锅
<13-4,ESPOSITO>leaving Thornton holding the bag.

709
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,140
<13-5,CASTLE>可能还定了《纽约客》
<13-5,CASTLE>Probably subscribes to "The New Yorker",

710
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,090
<13-5,CASTLE>却从来不看
<13-5,CASTLE>but doesn't even read it...

711
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,450
<13-6,RYAN>这家伙一直在耍我们
<13-6,RYAN>the guy's been playing us all along,

712
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,180
<13-6,RYAN>利用我们找到芬奇的同伙
<13-6,RYAN>using us to find Finch's accomplice.

713
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,280
<13-7,CASTLE>只不过是把《纽约客》摆在外面充门面
<13-7,CASTLE>Just leaves copies laying out where people can see 'em.

714
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,880
<13-8,BECKETT>-我们来让他现出原形  -怎样做呢
<13-8,BECKETT>- Let's nail the bastard.  - How?

715
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,720
<13-9,ESPOSITO>若是他在给雷辛报密
<13-9,ESPOSITO>If he was tipping off Racine,

716
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:07,130
<13-10,BECKETT>他不会用警区电话
<13-10,BECKETT>he wouldn't use the precinct phone.

717
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,990
<13-10,BECKETT>而是手机
<13-10,BECKETT>He'd use his cell.

718
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,210
<13-11,RYAN>我们可以取出手机卡
<13-11,RYAN>We could pull his SIM card.

719
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,950
<13-11,RYAN>若上面有和雷辛的通话记录
<13-11,RYAN>If there are any calls to Racine,

720
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,260
<13-11,RYAN>就证据确凿了
<13-11,RYAN>we have all the proof we need.

721
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,810
<13-12,CASTLE>怎样把他的手机弄到手呢
<13-12,CASTLE>How are we gonna get his phone away from him?

722
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,590
<13-13,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<13-13,ESPOSITO>What's up, man?

723
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,690
<13-14,BECKETT>我有个主意
<13-14,BECKETT>I have an idea.

724
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,850
<14-1,DEMMING>好久没练了
<14-1,DEMMING>It's been a while for me.

725
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,290
<14-2,BECKETT>-好  我会温柔点的  -那太好了
<14-2,BECKETT>- You know, I'll try to be gentle.  - Oh, you do that.

726
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,730
<14-4,BECKETT>太猛了吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Too much for you?

727
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,190
<14-5,DEMMING>不  我热身比较慢
<14-5,DEMMING>No, no. I'm just a little slow to get started.

728
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,780
<14-5,DEMMING>现在找到节奏了
<14-5,DEMMING>But I think I'm starting to find my rhythm now.

729
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,040
<15-1,RYAN>快点  快
<15-1,RYAN>Let's go. Hurry up.

730
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,240
<15-2,RYAN>怎么了
<15-2,RYAN>What?

731
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,610
<15-3,CASTLE>你好  干什么呢  洗澡吗
<15-3,CASTLE>Hey, man. What's up? Showering?

732
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,070
<15-4,RYAN>-到手了  -走
<15-4,RYAN>- Got it.  - Let's go.

733
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,890
<16-2,BECKETT>有没有松顿的消息
<16-2,BECKETT>Any news on Thornton?

734
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,310
<16-3,DEMMING>-没有  -埃斯波西托情况如何
<16-3,DEMMING>- None.  - How's Esposito taking all this?

735
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,740
<16-4,BECKETT>你觉得呢
<16-4,BECKETT>How do you think? I mean, here's a guy

736
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,530
<16-4,BECKETT>他为了纪念搭档一直
<16-4,BECKETT>who's been carrying his 54th key for

737

<16-5,DEMMING>-戴着54分局的钥匙扣  -我也有那个
<16-5,DEMMING>- in honor of his partner's sacrifice.  - I had one of those.

738
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,870
<16-6,BECKETT>-是吗  -是的
<16-6,BECKETT>- Oh, yeah?  - Yeah.

739
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,710
<16-6,BECKETT>但几年前弄丢了
<16-6,BECKETT>But I lost mine years ago.

740
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:40,880
<16-6,BECKETT>来
<16-6,BECKETT>Come on.

741
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,070
<17-1,CASTLE>这家伙肯定发过很多性短讯
<17-1,CASTLE>Bet this guy does a lot of sexting, too.

742
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,840
<17-2,RYAN>在加载了
<17-2,RYAN>It's uploading now.

<18-1,DEMMING>Oh. I gotta tell ya,

744
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,510
<18-1,DEMMING>我不知道还能坚持多久
<18-1,DEMMING>I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

745
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,660
<18-2,BECKETT>听说想一下棒球会有帮助
<18-2,BECKETT>You know, I hear it helps if you think about baseball.

746
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,100
<18-3,DEMMING>不办案的时候
<18-3,DEMMING>So what do you do for fun, Kate, huh,

747
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,870
<18-3,DEMMING>你都怎么消遣呢  凯特
<18-3,DEMMING>when you're not trying to take someone's head off?

748
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,520
<18-4,BECKETT>事实上我是个宅女
<18-4,BECKETT>I'm actually kind of a homebody.

749
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,370
<18-4,BECKETT>遇到你的前一晚
<18-4,BECKETT>You know, the night before I met you,

750
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,060
<18-4,BECKETT>我回家看书去了
<18-4,BECKETT>I went home to read a book.

751
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,690
<18-5,DEMMING>开玩笑吧
<18-5,DEMMING>No kidding?

752
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,920
<18-6,BECKETT>你呢

<18-7,DEMMING>还是遇到你的前一晚在做什么
<18-7,DEMMING>Or what was I doing the night before we met?

755
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,050
<18-8,DEMMING>说正经的
<18-8,DEMMING>Seriously...

756
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,930
<18-8,DEMMING>你为何不直接问我
<18-8,DEMMING>Why don't you just ask me

757
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,540
<18-8,DEMMING>是否有芬奇谋杀案的不在场证据
<18-8,DEMMING>if I have an alibi for Finch's murder?

758
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,900
<18-9,BECKETT>好吧  那你在哪里
<18-9,BECKETT>Okay. So where were you?

759
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,520
<19-1,RYAN>我通过反向目录查看了所有号码
<19-1,RYAN>I ran all his numbers through the reverse directory.

760
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,610
<19-1,RYAN>没有异常通话
<19-1,RYAN>They're all coming clean.

761
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,090
<19-2,BECKETT>因为那个人不是戴明
<19-2,BECKETT>That's because it wasn't Demming.

762
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,510
<19-3,RYAN>你的不在场证明证实了
<19-3,RYAN>Your alibi checked out.

763
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,200
<19-4,DEMMING>-谢谢  -他确实在给
<19-4,DEMMING>- Thank you.  - He really was coaching

764
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,440
<19-5,RYAN>一支贫困少年棒球队当教练
<19-5,RYAN>an underprivileged youth basketball league.

765
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,170
<19-6,DEMMING>值得欣慰的是  孩子们那晚赢了比赛
<19-6,DEMMING>Well, for what it's worth, my kids won that night.

766
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,950
<19-7,CASTLE>真假
<19-7,CASTLE>Oh, Jeez.

767
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,420
<19-8,RYAN>抱歉  必须排除嫌疑
<19-8,RYAN>Sorry, man. Had to rule you out.

768
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,460
<19-9,DEMMING>继续查案吧  有个奸细在警局
<19-9,DEMMING>Let's just move on. Look, there's a wrong cop out there.

769
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,510
<19-9,DEMMING>我们必须找出来
<19-9,DEMMING>We need to figure out who it is.

770
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,680
<19-10,ESPOSITO>你知道过去10年中
<19-10,ESPOSITO>Do you know how many cops

771
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,640
<19-10,ESPOSITO>有多少警察在54分局工作过吗
<19-10,ESPOSITO>have been through the 54th in the last 10 years?

772
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,060
<19-10,ESPOSITO>成百个  甚至上千个
<19-10,ESPOSITO>Hundreds, maybe thousands.

773
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,570
<19-11,BECKETT>不管是谁  那个人都不简单
<19-11,BECKETT>Well, whoever it was was very good.

774
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,020
<19-11,BECKETT>他不可能替恶人卖命
<19-11,BECKETT>You don't work the other side

775
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,540
<19-11,BECKETT>却不引起内务处的注意
<19-11,BECKETT>without arousing I.A. suspicion

776
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,760
<19-11,BECKETT>除非你相当谨慎
<19-11,BECKETT>unless you know what you're doing.

777
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,130
<19-12,ESPOSITO>我们不可能找到他了  就算找到
<19-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we're never gonna find him, not

778
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,370
<19-13,BECKETT>-也来不及了  -来不及什么
<19-13,BECKETT>- in time anyway.  - In time for what?

779
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,710
<19-14,ESPOSITO>我要去走走
<19-14,ESPOSITO>I gotta take a walk.

780
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,130
<19-15,RYAN>你不是说要走走吗
<19-15,RYAN>Hey, I thought you were going for a walk.

781
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,310
<19-16,ESPOSITO>你想做什么
<19-16,ESPOSITO>What do you want?

782
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,250
<19-17,RYAN>松顿今晚要去偷账簿  是不是
<19-17,RYAN>Thornton's going after the ledger tonight, isn't he?

783
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,780
<19-18,ESPOSITO>他独自追查了三年了
<19-18,ESPOSITO>The man's been on the run for three years,

784
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,740
<19-18,ESPOSITO>和家人不得不分开
<19-18,ESPOSITO>separated from his family.

785
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,440
<19-18,ESPOSITO>我必须帮他  别阻止我
<19-18,ESPOSITO>I gotta help the guy, so don't try to stop me.

786
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,350
<19-18,ESPOSITO>我不是要阻止你
<19-18,ESPOSITO>I'm not.

787
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,700
<19-19,RYAN>-我要和你一起去  -不  你不能去
<19-19,RYAN>- I'm going with you.  - No, you're not.

788

<19-21,RYAN>我是你搭档
<19-21,RYAN>I'm your partner.

789
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,790
<19-21,RYAN>不管怎样我都和你一起行动
<19-21,RYAN>That means I'm with you till the wheels fall off.

790
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:20,810
<19-22,ESPOSITO>我知道  兄弟
<19-22,ESPOSITO>I know, bro.

791
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,860
<19-22,ESPOSITO>但  万一发生意外
<19-22,ESPOSITO>But... I'm gonna need you to get my back

792
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,070
<19-22,ESPOSITO>得需要你帮忙照应  明白吗
<19-22,ESPOSITO>if things go wrong, all right?

793
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,200
<19-23,RYAN>好吧
<19-23,RYAN>Okay.

794
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,350
<19-23,RYAN>谢谢
<19-23,RYAN>Thanks.

795
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,560
<20-1,MONTGOMERY>案情有进展了吧  同志们
<20-1,MONTGOMERY>Tell me you got something, people.

796
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,600
<20-2,BECKETT>很抱歉  长官  我们陷入了死局
<20-2,BECKETT>Unfortunately, Sir, we are dead in the water.

797
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,870
<20-3,CASTLE>不  没有
<20-3,CASTLE>No... we're not.

798
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,840
<20-3,CASTLE>若松顿没有替雷辛做事
<20-3,CASTLE>If Thornton never worked for Racine,

799
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,350
<20-3,CASTLE>那三年前有人向内务处报了假情报
<20-3,CASTLE>then someone lied to I.A. three years ago.

800
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,260
<20-4,BECKETT>来洗清真正奸细的嫌疑
<20-4,BECKETT>To throw suspicion from the real dirty cop.

801
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,160
<20-5,CASTLE>所以和内务处谈话的那个人
<20-5,CASTLE>So whoever I.A. was talking to,

802
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,380
<20-5,CASTLE>肯定知道谁是奸细
<20-5,CASTLE>they must know who the real dirty cop is.

803
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,380
<20-5,CASTLE>我们只需要从霍利威尔那里搞一份
<20-5,CASTLE>All we need to do is get the name of the informant

804
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,710
<20-5,CASTLE>举报人名单然后审问他
<20-5,CASTLE>from Holliwell and run him down.

805
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,600
<20-6,DEMMING>说起来容易
<20-6,DEMMING>Easier said than done.

806
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,680
<20-6,DEMMING>内务处官员是不可能泄露
<20-6,DEMMING>There's no way an I.A. officer is gonna give up the name

807
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,960
<20-7,MONTGOMERY>-重要举报人姓名的  -不一定
<20-7,MONTGOMERY>- of a confidential informant.  -We'll see about that.

808
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,680
<21-1,IKE>你真的想好了吗
<21-1,IKE>You sure you're ready to bet your badge on this?

809
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,970
<21-1,IKE>-风险很大的  -你是我搭档
<21-1,IKE>- Pretty long odds.  - You're my partner.

810
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,130
<21-2,ESPOSITO>你确定能进得了雷辛的办公室吗
<21-2,ESPOSITO>You sure you can get us in Racine's office?

811
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:23,450
<21-3,IKE>相信我
<21-3,IKE>Trust me.

812
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,050
<21-3,IKE>我已经查探三年了
<21-3,IKE>I've been casing the joint for three years.

813
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,620
<21-3,IKE>行动吧
<21-3,IKE>Let's roll.

814
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,530
<22-1,BECKETT>长官  你怎么弄到的
<22-1,BECKETT>Sir, how did you do it?

815
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,360
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>投其所好  各取所需
<22-2,MONTGOMERY>Pulling strings and trading favors.

816
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,190
<22-3,BECKETT>怎么回事
<22-3,BECKETT>This can't be right.

817
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,630
<22-3,BECKETT>在三年前对艾克·松顿的调查报告上
<22-3,BECKETT>The investigation against Ike Thornton three years ago,

818
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,620
<22-3,BECKETT>霍利威尔督察把哈维尔·埃斯波西托警探
<22-3,BECKETT>Lieutenant Holliwell lists his chief informant

819
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,060
<22-3,BECKETT>列为重要举报人
<22-3,BECKETT>as Detective Javier Esposito.

820
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,410
<22-5,CASTLE>-混蛋  -什么意思
<22-5,CASTLE>- Son of a bitch.  - What does that mean?

821
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,640
<22-6,MONTGOMERY>根本没有举报人
<22-6,MONTGOMERY>It means there was no informant.

822
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,100
<22-7,BECKETT>长官  有没有办法查到
<22-7,BECKETT>Sir, is there any way to find out

823
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,920
<22-7,BECKETT>霍利威尔是否在54分局工作过
<22-7,BECKETT>if Holliwell served at the  54th?

824
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,700
<23-1,ESPOSITO>快点  兄弟  怎么要这么久
<23-1,ESPOSITO>Come on, bro. What the hell's taking so long?

825
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,210
<23-1,ESPOSITO>我都可以咬穿保险箱了
<23-1,ESPOSITO>I could have chewed through that by now.

826
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,090
<23-2,IKE>找到了
<23-2,IKE>There we go.

827
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,200
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>内务处的好处就是
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>Nice thing about Internal Affairs...

828
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,390
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>我们的工作就是监视其他警察
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>It's our job to monitor other cops.

829
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,270
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>你该把手机关死的
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>You should've turned your cell phone off completely,

830
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,050
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>埃斯波西托
<23-3,HOLLIWELL>Esposito,

831
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,980
<23-4,ESPOSITO>-全球定位你是知道的  -一直是你
<23-4,ESPOSITO>- You know, with GPS and all.  - All this time, it was you.

832
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,840
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>我猜你总要找来的
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>I figured you'd come for that sooner or later.

833
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,330
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>失策啊
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>Big mistake.

834
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,830
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>把账簿扔过来
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>Toss the ledger over here.

835
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,520
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>快扔
<23-5,HOLLIWELL>Throw it!

836
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,130
<23-6,HOLLIWELL>松顿  若我是你的话
<23-6,HOLLIWELL>See, if I were you Thornton...

837
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,270
<23-6,HOLLIWELL>我会继续装死
<23-6,HOLLIWELL>I woulda just stayed dead.

838
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,550
<23-7,IKE>你不配和我比  我是警察
<23-7,IKE>Well, you're not me. I'm a cop.

839
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,860
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>我可不认为你是警察  你是个通缉犯
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>Oh, I beg to differ, buddy. You're a wanted criminal.

840
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,990
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>问埃斯波西托好了
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>Just ask Esposito over here.

841
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,530
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>为了逮捕你 他光荣牺牲
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>He died trying to apprehend you.

842
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,000
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>我唯一的遗憾就是
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>My only regret is that I...

843
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,730
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>出现的太晚了  没能救他
<23-8,HOLLIWELL>I showed up too late to save him.

844
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,380
<23-9,ESPOSITO>你这个混蛋
<23-9,ESPOSITO>You son of a bitch.

845
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,740
<23-10,IKE>在了结之前
<23-10,IKE>Look, there's something I want to say

846
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,670
<23-10,IKE>我想说几句
<23-10,IKE>before we're done here.

<23-12,HOLLIWELL>松顿  杀了你我将获得
<23-12,HOLLIWELL>I am going to get the medal of valor

850
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,500
<23-13,IKE>-英勇勋章  -不  我说真的
<23-13,IKE>- for killing you, Thornton.  - No, I'm serious, man.

<23-13,IKE>谢谢你在"背后"支持我
<23-13,IKE>Thanks for having my back.

852

<24-1,HOLLIWELL>你们来了真是太好了  他们想杀我
<24-1,HOLLIWELL>Thank god you're here. They tried to kill me.

853
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,080
<24-1,HOLLIWELL>埃斯波西托和松顿  他们都参与了
<24-1,HOLLIWELL>Esposito and Thornton, they're both in on it.

854
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,610
<24-2,BECKETT>放下枪  不然我开枪了
<24-2,BECKETT>Drop it or I will drop you.

855
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,040
<24-3,DEMMING>霍利威尔  你知道规矩  把手举好
<24-3,DEMMING>You know the drill, Holliwell. Keep 'em up.

856
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,810
<24-3,DEMMING>霍利威尔督察
<24-3,DEMMING>Lieutenant Holliwell,

857
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,200
<24-4,BECKETT>你因谋杀保罗·芬奇被捕
<24-4,BECKETT>You're under arrest for the murder of Paul Finch.

858
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,970
<24-5,RYAN>埃斯波西托呢
