<1-3,SPIKE>-没错  -见着了?  又没睡觉?
<1-3,SPIKE>- Yeah. - Yeah? No sleep again?

19

<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>-什么碎了  -一只破杯子
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>- What broke? - A stupid glass.

<2-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>记得提醒我去买些"好"杯子
<2-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Remind me to get smarter glasses.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,980
<2-3,CASTLE>但我觉得问题不在于杯子的好坏
<2-3,CASTLE>Somehow I feel that the glass is not quite the problem.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,260
<2-4,ALEXIS>蕾西一家还有其他几个朋友
<2-4,ALEXIS>I got invited to the Hamptons with Lacey's family

<2-5,CASTLE>So why do you look like someone who just got voted off the island?

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,920
<2-6,ALEXIS>下周就要大学预修课考试了

<2-6,ALEXIS>但我又真的很想去汉普顿
<2-6,ALEXIS>But I really want to go to the Hamptons.

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,420
<2-7,CASTLE>工作与玩乐是永恒的两难抉择
<2-7,CASTLE>The eternal struggle between work and play.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,100
<2-7,CASTLE>窍门是  你长大后
<2-7,CASTLE>The trick is, when you grow up,

33
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,980
<2-7,CASTLE>找个"工作即玩乐"的工作
<2-7,CASTLE>find work that feels like play.

34
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,480
<2-8,ALEXIS>说到工作
<2-8,ALEXIS>Speaking of work...

35
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,690
<2-8,ALEXIS>你为什么这么早就起床整装待发了
<2-8,ALEXIS>What are you doing up and dressed so early?

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,920
<2-9,CASTLE>不为什么  我就是觉得应该趁早拥抱新的一天
<2-9,CASTLE>Oh, no reason. Just thought I'd get an early start to my day.

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,980

<3-10,BECKETT>怎么了  有什么问题吗
<3-10,BECKETT>Why? Is that a problem?

50
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,060

<4-2,CASTLE>我连个餐位都订不到
<4-2,CASTLE>I can't even get a reservation here.

58
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,150
<4-2,CASTLE>在这吃上一顿我死都值了
<4-2,CASTLE>I've been dying to eat here.

59
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,920
<4-3,BECKETT>事实证明  你不是唯一一个想死在这儿的
<4-3,BECKETT>Well, evidently, you're not the only one.

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,490
<4-3,BECKETT>-死者在哪  -厨房里

<4-6,ESPOSITO>就是他了
<4-6,ESPOSITO>I know. Right?

65
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,610
<4-7,CASTLE>不是吧  我再也尝不到他的鹅肝三明治了
<4-7,CASTLE>Aw, man. I never got to taste his foie gras sandwich.

66
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,030
<5-1,ESPOSITO>今早发现他的是糕点师
<5-1,ESPOSITO>He was found this morning by the pastry chef--

67
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,100

<5-1,ESPOSITO>还有一位洗碗工  胡安·科斯塔
<5-1,ESPOSITO>and one of the dishwashers-- Juan Costa.

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,310
<5-2,CASTLE>卡塞尔  别动
<5-2,CASTLE>Castle, stop!

70
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,220
<5-2,CASTLE>你没看到尸体周围的橙色圆锥物吗
<5-2,CASTLE>D-do you not see the little orange cones around the body?

71
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,580
<5-3,CASTLE>那真是他的手吗
<5-3,CASTLE>Is that actually his hand?

72
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,310
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>那是L-N-2造成的
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>That's the effect of L-N-2...

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,500
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>就是我们平常所说的液氮
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>Commonly known as liquid nitrogen,

74
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,430
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>一种制冷剂

<5-4,PERLMUTTER>It instantly freezes anything it comes in touch with,

76
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,280
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>包括伍尔夫先生  这导致他像玻璃一样易碎
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>including Mr. Wolf-- made him fragile as glass.

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,650
<5-5,CASTLE>这真是由内而外的酷毙了
<5-5,CASTLE>This is both literally and figuratively cool.

78
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,000
<5-5,CASTLE>伍尔夫一直推崇分子美食学
<5-5,CASTLE>Uh, Wolf was a follower of molecular gastronomy.

79
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,070
<5-5,CASTLE>就是用科学的方法去操作...
<5-5,CASTLE>It's using the science to manipulate the...

80
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,560
<5-5,CASTLE>你们都不关心这些
<5-5,CASTLE>And you don't care.

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,360
<5-6,PERLMUTTER>这东西通常是很安全的
<5-6,PERLMUTTER>It's usually pretty safe

82
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,740
<5-6,PERLMUTTER>除非某人把它倒在你身上
<5-6,PERLMUTTER>unless someone dumps it on you.

83
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,710
<5-7,BECKETT>死亡时间呢
<5-7,BECKETT>Time of death?

84
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,350
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>一切常用的指示物
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>Well, all our normal indicators...

85
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,050
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>都被液氮污染了
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>are contaminated by the L-N-2.

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,310
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>我回到停尸房之后再看看有什么办法
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>I'll see what I can do once I get to the morgue.

87
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,440
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>但是我们得先等他解冻一会
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>But, uh, we're gonna have to let him thaw a bit

88
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,400
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>然后才能移动尸体
<5-8,PERLMUTTER>before we can move him.

89
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,290
<5-9,CASTLE>-看上去有挣扎的痕迹  -是抢劫吗
<5-9,CASTLE>- Looks like there was a struggle.  - Robbery?

90
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,520
<5-10,BECKETT>不是  没有强闯的迹象  也没有丢东西
<5-10,BECKETT>No, no sign of forced entry, nothing's missing.

91
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,750
<5-11,RYAN>根据雷登哈尔先生和科斯塔先生所说
<5-11,RYAN>According to Mr. Ridenhauer and Mr. Costa here,

92
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,290
<5-11,RYAN>死者在其他人都离开餐厅后  还一直留在这
<5-11,RYAN>our victim stayed at the restaurant long after everyone else had left.

93
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,360
<5-12,BECKETT>那是什么时候
<5-12,BECKETT>And what time was that?

94
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,370
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>差不多十一点
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>It was around 11:00.

95
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,110
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>一位客人特别订制了一个蛋糕
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>One of our clients had special ordered a cake,

96
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,810
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>于是伍尔夫留下来把蛋糕做完
<5-13,RIDENHAUER>and Wolf stayed behind to finish it up.

97
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,330
<5-14,CASTLE>你不是糕点师吗
<5-14,CASTLE>Aren't you the pastry chef?

98
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,780
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>没错  但我可不会陪着伍尔夫一起疯
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>Yeah, but I don't do crazy stuff like Wolf does.

99
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,520
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>我只是做了垫子形状的底座
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>I just, uh, I made the cushion,

100
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,110
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>然后他刻了这个皇冠
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>and he sculpted the crown,

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,020
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>还有这颗心和珠宝
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>uh, the heart and the jewels.

102
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,730
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>也许这就是他把旋转蒸发器
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>That's probably why he had the rotary

103
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,880
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>和液氮拿出来的原因
<5-15,RIDENHAUER>evaporator out and the liquid nitrogen.

104
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,060
<5-16,BECKETT>好的  等帕穆特把尸体弄走之后
<5-16,BECKETT>All right, after Perlmutter gets the body out,

105
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,960
<5-16,BECKETT>让鉴证小组过来
<5-16,BECKETT>I'm gonna want CSU to come in

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,730
<7-3,BECKETT>没有强闯的迹象  通常表明凶手
<7-3,BECKETT>You know, no forced entry usually means that the killer

124
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,020
<7-3,BECKETT>要么认识厨师  要么有餐厅钥匙
<7-3,BECKETT>either knew the chef or was someone who had keys.

125
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,100
<7-3,BECKETT>所以我需要所有人的不在场证明
<7-3,BECKETT>So I'm gonna need alibis from everyone,

126
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,590
<7-3,BECKETT>包括你的
<7-3,BECKETT>including you.

127
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,410
<7-4,MADISON>-抱歉  -不不  我理解的
<7-4,MADISON>- Sorry.  - No. No, I, uh... I understand.

128
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,860
<7-4,MADISON>我去参加聚会直到凌晨
<7-4,MADISON>I was at a party until the wee hours.

129
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,120
<7-4,MADISON>很多人都见到我了
<7-4,MADISON>Lots of people saw me.

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,600
<7-5,BECKETT>那你知道伍尔夫有什么仇人吗
<7-5,BECKETT>Now did you know if Wolf had any enemies,

131
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,980
<7-5,BECKETT>有没有什么想伤害他的人
<7-5,BECKETT>anyone that wanted to do him harm?

132
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,170
<7-6,MADISON>他是个让所有人又爱又恨的家伙
<7-6,MADISON>He was the bad boy America loved to hate.

133
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,910
<7-6,MADISON>我当时是嘉宾评委  我们就这么认识的
<7-6,MADISON>I was a guest judge. That's how we met.

134
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,090
<7-6,MADISON>说真的  你从没听过《厨房大战》吗
<7-6,MADISON>Seriously? You never heard of "Kitchen Wars"?

135
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,120
<7-7,BECKETT>没有  我很少有时间看电视
<7-7,BECKETT>No. I don't really get a lot of time to watch tv.

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,180
<7-8,MADISON>这句话竟然出自一个曾花上好几个小时
<7-8,MADISON>This from the girl who'd spend hours

137
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,250
<7-8,MADISON>看《救命下课铃》重播的女孩之口
<7-8,MADISON>watching "Saved By The Bell" reruns?

138
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,490
<7-8,MADISON>真的啊
<7-8,MADISON>Really?

139
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,180
<7-9,CASTLE>她还曾花上那么长时间做过什么
<7-9,CASTLE>What else did she spend hours doing?

140
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,860
<7-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这里是犯罪现场
<7-10,BECKETT>Castle, real crime scene.

141
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,850
<7-10,BECKETT>不是悬疑小说家的调查时间  好不
<7-10,BECKETT>not mystery writer research time, okay?

142
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,770
<7-10,BECKETT>你最近有发现伍尔夫有什么异常吗
<7-10,BECKETT>Did you notice anything unusual about Wolf lately?

143
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,100
<7-10,BECKETT>任何事情
<7-10,BECKETT>Anything at all.

144
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,510
<7-11,MADISON>确实有一件事
<7-11,MADISON>There was one thing.

145
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,020
<7-11,MADISON>伍尔夫做起事来马不停蹄的
<7-11,MADISON>Wolf usually worked nonstop.

146
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,890
<7-11,MADISON>你根本没办法把他从厨房里拖出来
<7-11,MADISON>You couldn't tear him away from the kitchen.

147
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,050
<7-11,MADISON>但最近几周
<7-11,MADISON>But for the last couple of weeks,

148
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,890
<7-11,MADISON>他都会在三点的时候消失
<7-11,MADISON>he'd disappear around 3:00,

149
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,100
<7-11,MADISON>然后五点回来刚好赶上准备工作
<7-11,MADISON>and come back just in time to prep at 5:00.

150
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,700
<7-12,BECKETT>他有说他去哪了吗
<7-12,BECKETT>Did he say where he was going?

151
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,580
<7-13,MADISON>没有  他说是私事
<7-13,MADISON>No. He said it was personal.

152
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,670
<7-14,RYAN>伙计们  有发现
<7-14,RYAN>Hey, guys. I found something.

153
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,000
<8-1,RYAN>洗碗工胡安是昨晚最后一个离开这里的
<8-1,RYAN>Juan the dishwasher was the last one here last night,

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,440
<8-1,RYAN>他发誓他洗完了所有碟子
<8-1,RYAN>and he swears he finished every single dish.

155
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,970
<8-2,BECKETT>两个脏碗  两根汤勺  还有一个汤锅
<8-2,BECKETT>Two dirty bowls, two spoons and a soup pot?

156
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,730
<8-3,CASTLE>看起来伍尔夫深夜有人作伴
<8-3,CASTLE>Looks like Wolf had some late-night company.

157
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,120
<8-4,MADISON>是爆米花羹  这是多明戈的招牌菜
<8-4,MADISON>It's popcorn soup. It's Domingo's specialty.

158
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,560
<8-5,CASTLE>-多明戈  -我们的备菜厨师
<8-5,CASTLE>- Domingo?  - Our line chef.

159
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,110
<8-6,MADISON>他一定是在所有人离开以后回来过
<8-6,MADISON>He must have come back after everybody left.

160
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,350
<8-7,BECKETT>也就是说  他是伍尔夫生前见到的最后一个人
<8-7,BECKETT>That means he's the last one to have seen Wolf alive.

161
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
<8-7,BECKETT>-你有他的地址吗  -当然
<8-7,BECKETT>- Do you have an address? - Of course.

162
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,550
<8-8,MADISON>找到多明戈  弄清楚为什么
<8-8,MADISON>All right, track down Domingo and see

163
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,150
<8-9,BECKETT>他那么晚还在这里  以及他看到了什么
<8-9,BECKETT>why he was here so late and what he saw.

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,720
<8-9,BECKETT>我还需要伍尔夫亲属的联系方式
<8-9,BECKETT>I'll also need the contact info for Wolf's next of kin.

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,330
<9-1,CASTLE>高中好友  是吧
<9-1,CASTLE>High school friend, huh?

167
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,380
<9-1,CASTLE>我敢说她一定知道你不少糗事
<9-1,CASTLE>I bet she knows where all your bodies are buried.

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,530
<9-2,BECKETT>你大可尽情八卦  卡塞尔
<9-2,BECKETT>You can dig all you want, Castle.

169
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,130
<9-2,BECKETT>她绝对不会爆我料的
<9-2,BECKETT>My secrets are safe with her.

170
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,870
<9-3,CASTLE>你怎么这么肯定
<9-3,CASTLE>How can you be sure?

171
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,180
<9-4,BECKETT>因为不管她手里掌握了我什么料
<9-4,BECKETT>Because whatever she knows about me,

172
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,080
<9-4,BECKETT>我掌握的她的料都更猛
<9-4,BECKETT>I know worse about her.

173
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,100
<9-4,BECKETT>我们以前经常出去玩  一大堆人
<9-4,BECKETT>We used to hang out, big group of us,

174
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,140
<9-5,CASTLE>玩得很爽
<9-5,CASTLE>had a good time.

175
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,380
<9-5,CASTLE>那么...什么叫很爽
<9-5,CASTLE>And... what's a good time?

176
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,920
<9-6,BECKETT>如果你现在还不知道什么叫爽
<9-6,BECKETT>Well, if you don't know by now,

177
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
<9-6,BECKETT>那你这辈子都甭想知道了
<9-6,BECKETT>I'm sure it's too late to show you one.

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,290
<9-7,MADISON>这是伍尔夫的紧急联系人
<9-7,MADISON>Here's Wolf's emergency contact--

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,660
<9-7,MADISON>大卫·尼克莱斯
<9-7,MADISON>David Nicolaides.

180
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,060
<10-1,DAVID>伍尔夫没有什么真正意义上的家人
<10-1,DAVID>Wolf didn't have any real family.

181
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,360
<10-1,DAVID>他童年的大部分时光
<10-1,DAVID>He spent most of his childhood

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,670
<10-1,DAVID>都辗转于不同的领养家庭
<10-1,DAVID>in and out of foster homes,

183
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,060
<10-1,DAVID>所以我们才会被列为亲属
<10-1,DAVID>which is why we're listed as, uh, next of kin.

184
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,650
<10-1,DAVID>我和我的女友茜茜莉是他最亲近的人了
<10-1,DAVID>My girlfriend Cecily and I are about as close as it gets.

185
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,150
<10-2,CECILY>他们俩情同手足
<10-2,CECILY>They were like brothers.

186
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,430
<10-3,BECKETT>-你们认识多久了  -十几岁就认识了
<10-3,BECKETT>- How long did you know each other?  - Since our teens.

187
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,240
<10-4,DAVID>我爸爸给他份工作  在我家餐馆里打扫卫生
<10-4,DAVID>My dad gave him a job in our restaurant as a busboy,

188
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,040
<10-4,DAVID>当时他刚从少管所里出来
<10-4,DAVID>Uh, when he got out of juvie.

189
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,140
<10-4,DAVID>之后没多久
<10-4,DAVID>It didn't take long to tell

190
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,840
<10-4,DAVID>我们就发现他在烹饪方面颇有天赋
<10-4,DAVID>that he had a real gift for food.

191
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,780
<10-4,DAVID>从此他就好像我的家人一样
<10-4,DAVID>Been like family ever since.

192
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,080
<10-5,BECKETT>你知道他有什么仇家吗
<10-5,BECKETT>Did he have any enemies that you know of?

193
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,840
<10-6,CECILY>他在节目里一直以坏小子形象示人
<10-6,CECILY>He had a bad-boy image from the show,

194
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,510
<10-6,CECILY>但其实他是个好人
<10-6,CECILY>but he was actually sweet.

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,990
<10-7,CASTLE>在《厨房大战》中取胜
<10-7,CASTLE>Winning "Kitchen Wars"

196
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,170
<10-7,CASTLE>一定对他意义重大吧
<10-7,CASTLE>must have been huge for him.

197
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,260
<10-7,CASTLE>他当时是什么反应
<10-7,CASTLE>How was he handling it?

198
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,660
<10-8,DAVID>他很爱这种生活  名利双收
<10-8,DAVID>He loved it-- the fame, the fortune.

199
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,790
<10-8,DAVID>这都是他一直以来所梦想的  除了...
<10-8,DAVID>It was everything he ever dreamed of, e-except...

200
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,740
<10-9,BECKETT>除了什么
<10-9,BECKETT>Except what?

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,340
<10-10,DAVID>我想他可能经济方面遇到了点困难
<10-10,DAVID>I-I think he might have had some financial troubles.

202
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,670
<10-11,BECKETT>什么意思
<10-11,BECKETT>What do you mean?

203
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,050
<10-12,DAVID>当我爸爸几个月前去世时
<10-12,DAVID>When my dad passed away a few months back,

204
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,020
<10-12,DAVID>他把餐馆留给了我和伍尔夫
<10-12,DAVID>he left his restaurant to Wolf and me.

205
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,670
<10-12,DAVID>当然不是Q3那种高级餐厅
<10-12,DAVID>It was nothing fancy like Q3.

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
<10-12,DAVID>那只是皇后区的一个小饭店
<10-12,DAVID>It was just a little diner in queens.

207
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,730
<10-12,DAVID>但是两个星期前
<10-12,DAVID>But about two weeks ago,

208
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,760
<10-12,DAVID>他来找我  问我能不能买下他的股份
<10-12,DAVID>he came to me asking if I would buy him out.

209
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,960
<10-12,DAVID>我试着劝服他
<10-12,DAVID>I tried to talk him out of it.

210
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,600
<10-12,DAVID>我甚至告诉他我可以借钱给他
<10-12,DAVID>I even told him that I would loan him the money,

211
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,980
<10-12,DAVID>但他拒绝了
<10-12,DAVID>but he refused.

212
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,270
<10-12,DAVID>最后  我就买下了他的那份
<10-12,DAVID>And in the end, I gave in and I bought out his share.

213
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,790
<10-13,BECKETT>-多少钱买下的  -四万
<10-13,BECKETT>- For how much?  - $40,000.

214
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,210
<10-15,CASTLE>他不是在《厨房大战》里赢了一大笔钱吗
<10-15,CASTLE>Didn't he just win a lot of money on "Kitchen Wars"?

215
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,260
<10-16,DAVID>他把那笔钱全部投入新餐厅了
<10-16,DAVID>Well, he put it all into the new restaurant.

216
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,160
<10-16,DAVID>我曾劝他留下一点钱
<10-16,DAVID>I tried to tell him to hold some of it back,

217
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,150
<10-16,DAVID>但他属于那种孤注一掷的人
<10-16,DAVID>but he was an all-or-nothing kind of guy.

218
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,750
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>詹妮弗  伍尔夫,
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>Jennifer, Wolf,

219
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,390
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>我们给你们的菜肴打好分了
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>we've scored your dishes,

220
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,250
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>虽然结果很相近
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>and although it was very close,

221
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,550
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>巴尔萨扎·伍尔夫
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>Balthazar Wolf,

222
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,690
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>你是《厨房大战纽约站》的冠军
<11-1,HOST KITCHEN WARS>you're the winner of "Kitchen Wars, New York!"

223
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,680
<11-2,CASTLE>看看他的脸
<11-2,CASTLE>Look at his face.

224
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,690
<11-2,CASTLE>看到他多高兴没?
<11-2,CASTLE>See how happy he is?

225
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,300
<11-4,CASTLE>他全然不知八个月后  他会丧命
<11-4,CASTLE>He had no idea in eight months, he'd be dead.

226
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,630
<11-5,BECKETT>拿到了银行的搜查令
<11-5,BECKETT>Well, the bank has the warrant,

227
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,830
<11-5,BECKETT>几小时后我们就知道他的经济状况了
<11-5,BECKETT>so we should have his financials in a couple of hours.

228
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,200
<11-5,BECKETT>如果他有什么金钱方面的问题  我们会发现的
<11-5,BECKETT>If he was having money troubles, we'll find out.

230
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,410
<11-7,BECKETT>午夜汤点师那边有什么进展吗
<11-7,BECKETT>Hey, how'd it go with the late-night soup maker?

231
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,450
<11-7,BECKETT>找到他没
<11-7,BECKETT>You guys find him?

232
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,340
<11-8,ESPOSITO>我们很快就找到他了
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, we found him all right.

233
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,180
<11-8,ESPOSITO>他当时正在机场排队
<11-8,ESPOSITO>In line at the airport

234
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,650
<11-8,ESPOSITO>箱子里揣着五千块现金
<11-8,ESPOSITO>with $5,000 cash in his suitcase

235
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,230
<11-8,ESPOSITO>还有一张去厄瓜多尔的单程票
<11-8,ESPOSITO>and a one-way ticket to Ecuador.

236
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,220
<11-9,CASTLE>逃出国境简直就是变相承认自己的罪名嘛
<11-9,CASTLE>Nothing says "I'm guilty" like an attempt to flee the country.

243
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,830
<12-1,CASTLE>下次你想把人冻成冰棍的时候
<12-1,CASTLE>The next time you decide to go all Mr. Freeze on someone,

244
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,160
<12-1,CASTLE>千万记得不要留下任何痕迹
<12-1,CASTLE>you should really clean up after yourself.

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,890
<12-1,CASTLE>我们在水池里发现了你的碗
<12-1,CASTLE>We found your bowls in the sink.

246
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,880
<12-2,DOMINGO>我不懂你在说什么
<12-2,DOMINGO>I don't understand.

247
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,030
<12-3,BECKETT>我们发现你带着行李箱
<12-3,BECKETT>We found you with a packed suitcase,

248
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,100
<12-3,BECKETT>揣着去厄瓜多尔的单程机票  还有五千现金
<12-3,BECKETT>plane tickets to Ecuador and $5,000 in cash.

249
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,380
<12-4,DOMINGO>这不算有罪吧
<12-4,DOMINGO>That is not a crime.

250
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,260
<12-4,DOMINGO>我有护照的
<12-4,DOMINGO>I have a passport.

251
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,110
<12-5,BECKETT>你用此来从一桩谋杀案中脱身
<12-5,BECKETT>Which you were using to flee a murder.

252
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,380
<12-6,DOMINGO>谋杀?  你以为我杀了谁
<12-6,DOMINGO>Murder? Who do you think I killed?

253
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,300
<12-7,CASTLE>你那戴着厨师帽的头儿
<12-7,CASTLE>Your boss in the big white hat.

254
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,940
<12-8,DOMINGO>伍尔夫?
<12-8,DOMINGO>Wolf?

255
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,850
<12-8,DOMINGO>伍尔夫死了? 怎么死的
<12-8,DOMINGO>Wolf's dead? how?

256
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,290
<12-9,BECKETT>维多戈先生  坐下
<12-9,BECKETT>Mr. Verdugo, sit down.

257
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,230
<12-10,DOMINGO>我没杀任何人
<12-10,DOMINGO>I did not kill anyone.

258
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,530
<12-11,BECKETT>我们知道你昨晚去找他了
<12-11,BECKETT>We know you came to see him last night.

259
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,970
<12-12,DOMINGO>没错  我昨晚回了餐厅一趟
<12-12,DOMINGO>Yes. I came back to the restaurant last night.

260
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,480
<12-12,DOMINGO>我的妹妹在厄瓜多尔
<12-12,DOMINGO>My sister, she's in Ecuador.

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,900
<12-12,DOMINGO>她病的很重  需要做手术
<12-12,DOMINGO>She's very sick. She needs surgery.

262
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,670
<12-12,DOMINGO>我去问主厨能不能让我回家一趟
<12-12,DOMINGO>I came to ask Chef if can go home.

263
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,800
<12-13,BECKETT>五千块不是一笔小数目
<12-13,BECKETT>$5,000 is a lot of money.

264
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,180
<12-13,BECKETT>你从哪弄到的钱
<12-13,BECKETT>Where did you get it from?

265
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,610
<12-14,DOMINGO>伍尔夫主厨给我的  用来给我妹妹做手术
<12-14,DOMINGO>Chef Wolf gave it to me for my sister's operation.

266
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,970
<12-14,DOMINGO>我说他这是疯了  但是他坚持把钱给我
<12-14,DOMINGO>Told him he was crazy, but he insisted.

267
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,570
<12-14,DOMINGO>他说  回去照顾你妹妹吧
<12-14,DOMINGO>He said, "go take care of your sister."

268
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,630
<12-14,DOMINGO>五年了  我一直和伍尔夫一起工作
<12-14,DOMINGO>Look, five years, I've worked with Wolf.

269
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,590
<12-14,DOMINGO>他是我的朋友
<12-14,DOMINGO>He's my friend.

270
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,510
<12-14,DOMINGO>我没有杀他
<12-14,DOMINGO>I didn't kill him.

271
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,450
<12-15,BECKETT>他这么巧就有五千现金在身上
<12-15,BECKETT>And he just happened to have 5 grand dollar.

272
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,260
<12-16,DOMINGO>没错  在他的背包里
<12-16,DOMINGO>Yes, in his backpack.

273
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,330
<12-16,DOMINGO>我答应会还给他的
<12-16,DOMINGO>Look, I promised to pay him back.

274
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,900
<12-17,CASTLE>他在背包里放了那么多钱吗
<12-17,CASTLE>He had that much money in a backpack?

275
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,470
<12-18,DOMINGO>是的  还有更多呢  很多
<12-18,DOMINGO>Yeah, he had more, a lot more.

276
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,910
<12-18,DOMINGO>我告诉他不应该带那么多现金
<12-18,DOMINGO>Look, I told him he shouldn't carry so much cash.

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,310
<12-18,DOMINGO>他会被...
<12-18,DOMINGO>He could get...

278
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,890
<12-18,DOMINGO>杀掉的
<12-18,DOMINGO>Killed.

279
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,080
<12-19,BECKETT>凶案现场没有背包
<12-19,BECKETT>There was no backpack at the scene.

280
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,480
<12-20,DOMINGO>也许被那位气冲冲的女士偷走了
<12-20,DOMINGO>Maybe that angry lady stole it.

281
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,910
<12-20,DOMINGO>-也许是她杀的伍尔夫  -哪个气冲冲的女士
<12-20,DOMINGO>- Maybe she's the one who killed Wolf. - What angry lady?

282
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,330
<12-22,DOMINGO>-他的一个女友  她来了我就离开了  -何时
<12-22,DOMINGO>- One of his girlfriends. I left when she came. - When?

283
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,690
<12-24,DOMINGO>过了午夜  大约在零点四十五
<12-24,DOMINGO>After midnight, like around 12:45.

284
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,660
<12-25,BECKETT>-知道她的名字吗  -不知道
<12-25,BECKETT>- Do you know her name? - No.

285
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,430
<12-26,DOMINGO>但是她总是到餐厅来
<12-26,DOMINGO>But she came into the restaurant all the time.

286
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,500
<12-27,BECKETT>能描述她的长相吗
<12-27,BECKETT>Can you describe her?

287
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,740
<13-1,BECKETT>厨房的员工确认
<13-1,BECKETT>So the kitchen staff confirms

288
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,080
<13-1,BECKETT>伍尔夫昨天的确带着背包
<13-1,BECKETT>that Wolf did have a backpack with him yesterday,

289
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,610
<13-1,BECKETT>他们之所以注意到
<13-1,BECKETT>and the only reason that they noticed it

290
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,660
<13-1,BECKETT>是因为他通常不背包
<13-1,BECKETT>is because he didn't usually carry one.

291
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,520
<13-2,CASTLE>这么说多明戈说了实话
<13-2,CASTLE>So Domingo was telling the truth.

292
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,520
<13-3,BECKETT>背包存在这个事实
<13-3,BECKETT>Well, just because the backpack exists

293
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,590
<13-3,BECKETT>并不意味着他的供词完全可信
<13-3,BECKETT>doesn't mean that the rest of his story is credible.

294
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,460
<13-4,ESPOSITO>是啊  但是关于钱的那部分是真的
<13-4,ESPOSITO>No, but he's telling the truth about the money.

295
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,170
<13-4,ESPOSITO>伍尔夫的财政情况调出来了
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Wolf's financials came in.

296
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,300
<13-4,ESPOSITO>近六个月
<13-4,ESPOSITO>There's nothing out of the ordinary

297
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,030
<13-4,ESPOSITO>没有异常  但是两周前
<13-4,ESPOSITO>over the last six months, but then--bam--two weeks ago,

298
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,270
<13-4,ESPOSITO>他从他的户头将全部存款取出
<13-4,ESPOSITO>he withdraws all his savings from his checking account.

299
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,670
<13-6,BECKETT>-一万五千美元  -两周前
<13-6,BECKETT>- $15,000. - 2 weeks ago?

300
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,350
<13-6,BECKETT>正是那个时候伍尔夫请求
<13-6,BECKETT>That's about the time that Wolf

301
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,890
<13-6,BECKETT>他的义兄大卫买下他的股份
<13-6,BECKETT>asked his foster brother David to buy his share.

302
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,210
<13-7,ESPOSITO>支票刚兑现
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and as soon as that check cleared,

303
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,540
<13-7,ESPOSITO>他就取出了那四万美元的现金
<13-7,ESPOSITO>he withdrew that $40,000 in cash.

304
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,010
<13-8,RYAN>就在他死亡当天
<13-8,RYAN>On the day he was killed.

305
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,800
<13-9,CASTLE>一个人要四万现金干什么
<13-9,CASTLE>Why would someone need $40,000 in cash?

306
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,590
<13-10,BECKETT>肯定是违法的事情
<13-10,BECKETT>Well, nothing legal.

307
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,790
<13-10,BECKETT>麦蒂森说他每天下午三点到五点
<13-10,BECKETT>You know, Madison said that he would disappear every day

308
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,330
<13-10,BECKETT>都会不见人影
<13-10,BECKETT>between 3:00 and 5:00 pm.

309
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,350
<13-10,BECKETT>也许他去的地方和这笔钱有关
<13-10,BECKETT>Maybe where he went had something to do with the money.

310
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,230
<13-10,BECKETT>你们再去和厨房员工核实一下
<13-10,BECKETT>Why don't you guys talk to the kitchen staff again?

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,760
<13-10,BECKETT>再查一查他的信用卡消费收据
<13-10,BECKETT>And let's look into his credit card receipts.

312
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,230
<13-10,BECKETT>也许我们可以弄清他去了哪里
<13-10,BECKETT>Maybe we can figure out where he was going.

313
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,770
<13-10,BECKETT>电话记录方面有什么消息
<13-10,BECKETT>And where are we on the phone records?

314
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,200
<13-11,RYAN>手机卡在冷冻过程中坏掉了
<13-11,RYAN>Oh, the sim card was damaged from the freezing.

315
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,830
<13-11,RYAN>技术人员在努力还原数据
<13-11,RYAN>Tech's seeing what they can salvage.

316
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,520
<13-11,RYAN>我们向通讯公司递交了通话记录的传票
<13-11,RYAN>And we subpoenaed his phone records from the provider.

317
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,000
<13-11,RYAN>还在等待回复
<13-11,RYAN>We're waiting on those.

318
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,140
<13-13,CASTLE>她看起来很可疑
<13-13,CASTLE>She looks kinda sketchy to me.

319
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,360
<14-1,MADISON>她是桑德拉
<14-1,MADISON>That's Sandra.

320
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,370
<14-1,MADISON>-她和她丈夫每周六都来  -丈夫
<14-1,MADISON>- She and her husband are in every Saturday. - Husband?

321
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,170
<14-3,MADISON>是啊
<14-3,MADISON>Yeah.

322
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,490
<14-4,BECKETT>多明戈暗示伍尔夫和她有感情瓜葛
<14-4,BECKETT>Domingo hinted at a romantic relationship.

323
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,940
<14-5,CASTLE>这肯定违反了好几条卫生管理条例
<14-5,CASTLE>Which has to violate several health codes.

324
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,800
<14-6,BECKETT>-记得他们的姓氏吗  -不记得
<14-6,BECKETT>- Do you remember their last name? - No, no.

325
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,620
<14-7,MADISON>但是她的信息应该在预定簿上
<14-7,MADISON>But her information should be in the reservation book.

326
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,550
<14-8,BECKETT>你怎么样
<14-8,BECKETT>How you holding up?

327
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,910
<14-9,MADISON>还很震惊  不过没有时间难过
<14-9,MADISON>I'm still reeling, and I have no time to grieve.

328
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,580
<14-9,MADISON>伍尔夫是个朋友  但不管怎样
<14-9,MADISON>Wolf was a friend, but like it or not,

329
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,590
<14-9,MADISON>我得面试代替他的主厨
<14-9,MADISON>I have to interview replacement chefs.

330
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,150
<14-9,MADISON>我还没有找到伍尔夫做的蛋糕的收据
<14-9,MADISON>I still haven't found that customer slip

331
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,160
<14-9,MADISON>不知道给谁订做的  明晚还要参加在
<14-9,MADISON>for that cake Wolf was making, and I have this charity event

332
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,080
<14-9,MADISON>雷克·迪斯普利托[著名厨师]的餐厅举行的慈善晚宴
<14-9,MADISON>tomorrow night at Rocco Dispirito's.

333
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,180
<14-9,MADISON>要是我没出现
<14-9,MADISON>If I don't show up,

334
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,580
<14-9,MADISON>大家会认为伍尔夫的死意味着Q3的终结
<14-9,MADISON>people will think wolf's death means the death of Q3.

335
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,400
<14-9,MADISON>也许你可以和我一起去
<14-9,MADISON>Hey, maybe you should come with me.

336
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,760
<14-9,MADISON>我需要一些精神上的支持
<14-9,MADISON>I could use the moral support,

337
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,750
<14-9,MADISON>或许我们能叙叙旧
<14-9,MADISON>and maybe we can catch up on old times.

338
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,070
<14-10,BECKETT>我很想去  只是我有安排了
<14-10,BECKETT>You know, I would love to. It's just, I have something.

339
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,280
<14-11,MADISON>安排
<14-11,MADISON>"Something"?

340
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,440
<14-12,CASTLE>我可以提供精神上的支持
<14-12,CASTLE>You know, I'm available for moral support.

341
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,870
<14-12,CASTLE>我一直想去雷克的新餐厅试试
<14-12,CASTLE>And I've been dying to try out Rocco's new place.

342
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,740
<14-13,MADISON>一位迷人的健谈者  再好不过了
<14-13,MADISON>A charming raconteur. That's just what the doctor ordered.

343
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,310
<14-13,MADISON>谢谢你  里克
<14-13,MADISON>Thank you, Rick.

344
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,030
<14-14,CASTLE>-除非你有异议  -完全没问题
<14-14,CASTLE>- Unless that's a problem. - No, not a problem.

345
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,900
<14-15,BECKETT>找到了
<14-15,BECKETT>Oh, here it is.

346
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,380
<14-16,MADISON>桑德拉·迈尔斯
<14-16,MADISON>Sandra Meyers.

347
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,420
<15-1,BECKETT>你和伍尔夫之间的
<15-1,BECKETT>What was the exact nature

348
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,370
<15-1,BECKETT>关系到底是什么样的
<15-1,BECKETT>of your relationship with Wolf?

349
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,070
<15-2,SANDRA>食物让我兴奋
<15-2,SANDRA>Food turns me on.

350
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,550
<15-2,SANDRA>不是当做情趣玩具  是烹饪给身体带来的快感
<15-2,SANDRA>Not as a sex toy, but the sensual act of cooking.

351
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,110
<15-2,SANDRA>当我在《厨房大战》看到伍尔夫时
<15-2,SANDRA>And when I saw Wolf on "Kitchen Wars,"

352
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
<15-2,SANDRA>看到他对食材的热情  我被吸引了
<15-2,SANDRA>how passionate he was with his ingredients, I fell in lust.

353
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,570
<15-2,SANDRA>Q3刚刚开张  我和我丈夫就去捧场了
<15-2,SANDRA>My husband and I were the first through the doors when Q3 opened.

354
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,570
<15-2,SANDRA>当伍尔夫来关照用餐情况时
<15-2,SANDRA>And when Wolf came by to check on our meal,

355
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,750
<15-2,SANDRA>我把电话号码递给了他
<15-2,SANDRA>I slipped him my number.

356
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,370
<15-3,CASTLE>你们总是在餐厅发生关系吗
<15-3,CASTLE>Did you always have sex in the restaurant?

357
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,530
<15-4,SANDRA>当然  厨房是伍尔夫如鱼得水的地方
<15-4,SANDRA>Well, Wolf did his best work in the kitchen.

358
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,790
<15-6,BECKETT>你丈夫从来没有怀疑过吗
<15-6,BECKETT>And your husband never suspected?

359
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,390
<15-7,SANDRA>他不在急诊室工作的晚上
<15-7,SANDRA>When he's not working nights at the E.R.,

360
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,120
<15-7,SANDRA>他会吃安眠药昏睡过去
<15-7,SANDRA>he's conked out on sleeping pills.

361
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,610
<15-7,SANDRA>即使我在客厅拍A片  他也不会知道
<15-7,SANDRA>I could shoot porn in my living room, he'd have no idea.

362
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,210
<15-7,SANDRA>你会告诉我丈夫吗
<15-7,SANDRA>Are you gonna tell my husband?

363
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,130
<15-8,BECKETT>你是谋杀调查的头号嫌疑人
<15-8,BECKETT>You're the primary suspect in a murder investigation.

364
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,330
<15-8,BECKETT>你的丈夫  可不是你最该担心的
<15-8,BECKETT>Your husband is the least of your worries.

365
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,160
<15-9,CASTLE>那晚发生了什么  桑德拉
<15-9,CASTLE>So what happened that night, Sandra?

366
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,300
<15-9,CASTLE>-性变得死气沉沉了  -没有性
<15-9,CASTLE>- The sex turn deadly? - No, there was no sex.

367
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,000
<15-10,SANDRA>两周前  伍尔夫突然给我打电话
<15-10,SANDRA>Two weeks ago, Wolf called me out of the blue

368
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,970
<15-10,SANDRA>说我们之间结束了
<15-10,SANDRA>to tell me we were through.

369
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,500
<15-12,SANDRA>-两周前  -我给他打电话
<15-12,SANDRA>- Two weeks. - I tried calling him,

370
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,030
<15-12,SANDRA>但是他没有打回来
<15-12,SANDRA>but he wouldn't call me back.

371
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,610
<15-12,SANDRA>所以我就去餐厅看看怎么回事
<15-12,SANDRA>So I went to the restaurant last night to find out why.

372
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,250
<15-13,BECKETT>然后呢
<15-13,BECKETT>And?

373
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,280
<15-14,SANDRA>他说他不想再鬼混了
<15-14,SANDRA>He said he was done screwing around,

374
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,770
<15-14,SANDRA>他说是成熟的时候了  翻开新的一页
<15-14,SANDRA>that it was time to grow up, turn over a new damn leaf.

375
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,790
<15-15,BECKETT>这样做显然让你很生气
<15-15,BECKETT>And that clearly made you angry.

376
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,180
<15-15,BECKETT>当然
<15-15,BECKETT>Sure.

377
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,610
<15-16,SANDRA>但是我没杀他
<15-16,SANDRA>But I didn't kill him.

378
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,270
<15-17,BECKETT>迈尔斯太太  你经常出轨
<15-17,BECKETT>Mrs Meyers, you cheat on your husband on a regular basis.

379
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,790
<15-17,BECKETT>我们为什么要相信你
<15-17,BECKETT>Why should we believe you?

380
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,300
<15-18,SANDRA>问问我大楼的门卫
<15-18,SANDRA>Ask the doorman at my building.

381
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,150
<15-18,SANDRA>一点半以前我就回去了
<15-18,SANDRA>I was back before 1:30.

382
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,080
<15-18,SANDRA>我一点十五离开的时候  伍尔夫还活着
<15-18,SANDRA>When I left the restaurant at 1:15, Wolf was alive.

383
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,460
<16-1,ESPOSITO>门卫确认了迈尔斯太太的证词
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Doorman confirms Mrs. Meyers' story,

384
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,930
<16-1,ESPOSITO>医院也确认迈尔斯医生
<16-1,ESPOSITO>and the hospital has Dr. Meyers logged

385
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,320
<16-1,ESPOSITO>当晚登记在值夜班
<16-1,ESPOSITO>as working the graveyard shift.

386
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,390
<16-2,CASTLE>那位说谎出轨的妻子说了真话
<16-2,CASTLE>Well, our lying, cheating wife was telling the truth.

387
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,440
<16-3,BECKETT>在我们确认伍尔夫死亡时间之前
<16-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but until we figure out Wolf's time of death,

388
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,740
<16-3,BECKETT>她依然是头号嫌疑人
<16-3,BECKETT>she's still our best suspect.

389
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,110
<16-4,RYAN>我调查了伍尔夫每天失踪的去向
<16-4,RYAN>So I ran down Wolf's daily disappearance.

390
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,390
<16-4,RYAN>他的信用卡显示
<16-4,RYAN>His credit card records

391
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,390
<16-4,RYAN>过去几周每天他都会
<16-4,RYAN>show a charge at Cafe Rex

392
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,080
<16-4,RYAN>在三点四十五在雷克斯咖啡馆消费
<16-4,RYAN>every day the last couple of weeks around 3:45.

393
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,660
<16-5,CASTLE>雷克斯咖啡馆  那是在七十区第二街上
<16-5,CASTLE>Cafe Rex? That's on 2nd in the 70's.

394
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,810
<16-5,CASTLE>伍尔夫在那做什么
<16-5,CASTLE>What was Wolf doing there?

395
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,670
<16-6,BECKETT>你们去那里查一查
<16-6,BECKETT>Why don't you guys head up

396
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,320
<16-6,BECKETT>他是不是和别人碰面
<16-6,BECKETT>and see if he was meeting with anyone?

398
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,930
<16-6,BECKETT>好的  我们马上去
<16-6,BECKETT>Okay. We'll be right there.

399
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,120
<16-6,BECKETT>走吧  帕穆特有发现
<16-6,BECKETT>Come on. Perlmutter found something.

400
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,090
<17-1,CASTLE>尸体怎么样了
<17-1,CASTLE>How's our corpse-sicle?

401
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,480
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>融化的不错
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>Thawing nicely.

402
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,210
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>尽管有显而易见的难度
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>Uh, in spite of the obvious challenges,

403
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,120
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>我还是找到了足够未受影响的组织
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>I found enough unaffected tissue to narrow time of death

404
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,470
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>将死亡时间定于凌晨两点到四点
<17-2,PERLMUTTER>to between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.

405
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,160
<17-3,CASTLE>这样就排除多明戈和迈尔斯太太的嫌疑了
<17-3,CASTLE>Well, that knocks out both Domingo and Mrs. Meyers.

406
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,910
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>我们用发热灯照射他的身体时
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>Now once we got him under the heat lamps,

407
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,620
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>一些瘀伤便开始显现
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>some bruising began to present.

408
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,750
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>首先
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>Uh, first...

409
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,110
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>在他的后背和腿部有很明显的
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>there were significant contusions

410
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,420
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>挫伤伤痕
<17-4,PERLMUTTER>along his back and legs.

411
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,210
<17-5,BECKETT>看起来是很严重的殴打
<17-5,BECKETT>Wow. This looks like a pretty bad beating.

412
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,540
<17-5,BECKETT>是在他被杀的那晚发生的吗
<17-5,BECKETT>Did this happen the night of the murder?

413
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,480
<17-6,PERLMUTTER>这些伤痕至少有两周了
<17-6,PERLMUTTER>Uh, these bruises are at least two weeks old.

414
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,470
<17-7,CASTLE>身上有瘀伤  带着四万美元现金
<17-7,CASTLE>Bruising on the body, $40,000 in cash...

415
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,750
<17-7,CASTLE>把餐馆的股份卖给了他义兄
<17-7,CASTLE>Sold his shares in the diner to his foster brother...

416
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,650
<17-8,BECKETT>都是在这两周发生的
<17-8,BECKETT>All within the same 2-week time span.

417
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,840
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>我在他头部发现一处新伤
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>I also found a fresh bruise

418
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,320
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>就在他被冷冻之前被打伤的
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>from a blow he suffered just before he was frozen.

419
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,030
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>我看过了鉴证组在现场拍的照片
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>I went through the crime scene photos from CSU,

420
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,270
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>伤口的痕迹
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>and the bruise pattern

421
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,020
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>与其中一个物品的形状吻合
<17-9,PERLMUTTER>matches one of the objects from the kitchen.

422
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,190
<17-10,CASTLE>旋转蒸发器
<17-10,CASTLE>Rotary evaporator.

423
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,760
<17-10,CASTLE>是主厨用来蒸馏和提炼...
<17-10,CASTLE>It's a tool that chefs use to distill and extract flavors from...

424
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,130
<17-10,CASTLE>看来你们还是不关心
<17-10,CASTLE>and again, you don't care.

425
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,390
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>蒸发器主体上没有找到指纹
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>Yeah, we didn't find any prints on the body of the appliance,

426
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,150
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>但在破碎的玻璃管上找到了部分指纹
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>but there were some partials on its shattered glass tube.

427
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,030
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>实验室的人
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>Now the guys in the lab

428
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,330
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>将碎片拼起来  得到了一个可用的指纹
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>were able to humpty-dumpty together a usable print.

429
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,330
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>餐厅员工中没有匹配者
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>Didn't match any of the restaurant employees,

430
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,460
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>但在指纹识别系统中  查到一个匹配者
<17-11,PERLMUTTER>but when they ran it through AFIS, they got a hit.

431
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,250
<17-12,BECKETT>-詹妮弗·王  -不会吧
<17-12,BECKETT>- Jennifer Wong.  - No.

432
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,610
<17-12,BECKETT>詹妮弗·王是谁
<17-12,BECKETT>Who's Jennifer Wong?

433
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,720
<18-1,JENNIFER>你知道我要用牛肉
<18-1,JENNIFER>You knew I was using the veal, so you went

434
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,600
<18-1,JENNIFER>你就到肉铺将所有牛肉买光
<18-1,JENNIFER>straight to the butcher and bought everything he had.

435
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,230
<18-2,WOLF>你以为我会在意搞阴谋破坏吗
<18-2,WOLF>You think I care about sabotaging you?

436
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,670
<18-2,WOLF>我一只手绑在背后
<18-2,WOLF>I can cook you off the show

437
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,880
<18-2,WOLF>也能赢你
<18-2,WOLF>with one hand tied behind my back.

438
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,700
<18-2,WOLF>你输了是因为你只是用脑烹饪
<18-2,WOLF>You lost because you cook with your head.

439
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,970
<18-2,WOLF>我是用心烹饪
<18-2,WOLF>I cook with my soul.

440
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,100
<18-3,JENNIFER>他说谎  他偷了我的秘方
<18-3,JENNIFER>He's a liar. He stole that recipe from me.

441
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,980
<18-3,JENNIFER>我对天发誓  如果伍尔夫赢了
<18-3,JENNIFER>I swear to god, if Wolf wins,

442
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,160
<19-1,JENNIFER>我就宰了那婊子养的
<19-1,JENNIFER>I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

443
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,700
<19-1,JENNIFER>他偷了我的秘方
<19-1,JENNIFER>He stole that recipe from me.

444
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,660
<19-1,JENNIFER>我对天发誓  如果伍尔夫赢了
<19-1,JENNIFER>I swear to god, if Wolf wins,

445
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,830
<19-1,JENNIFER>我就宰了那婊子养的
<19-1,JENNIFER>I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

446
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,700
<19-2,BECKETT>听起来你跟伍尔夫先生有深仇大恨啊
<19-2,BECKETT>Sounds like you and Mr. Wolf had quite the rivalry.

447
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,800
<19-3,JENNIFER>-那又怎样  -得了
<19-3,JENNIFER>- What about it?  - Oh, come on.

448
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,320
<19-4,CASTLE>眼睁睁地看着他拿走10万美金大奖
<19-4,CASTLE>It had to be difficult, watching him walk away

449
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,740
<19-4,CASTLE>肯定不好受
<19-4,CASTLE>with that $100,000 prize.

450
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,460
<19-4,CASTLE>更别提这名声威望
<19-4,CASTLE>Not to mention the publicity and fame

451
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,590
<19-4,CASTLE>大大帮助了他的事业
<19-4,CASTLE>that catapulted his career.

452
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,490
<19-5,BECKETT>不难相信过去几个月
<19-5,BECKETT>And it's not hard to believe that the resentment

453
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,270
<19-5,BECKETT>仇恨渐渐滋生
<19-5,BECKETT>was building up over the past couple of months

454
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,750
<19-5,BECKETT>直到压力把你推向极端
<19-5,BECKETT>until the pressure finally put you over the edge.

455
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,610
<19-6,JENNIFER>等等  你认为我杀了他
<19-6,JENNIFER>Wait. You think I killed him?

456
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,170
<19-6,JENNIFER>伍尔夫和我的敌对关系
<19-6,JENNIFER>That rivalry between Wolf and me...

457
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,650
<19-6,JENNIFER>只是一出戏
<19-6,JENNIFER>It was just an act.

458
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,750
<19-7,CASTLE>一出戏
<19-7,CASTLE>An act?

459
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,580
<19-8,BECKETT>我以为《厨房大战》是一档真人秀
<19-8,BECKETT>I thought that "Kitchen Wars" was a reality show.

460
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,560
<19-9,JENNIFER>强调"秀"  不管输赢
<19-9,JENNIFER>Emphasis on "show." And win or lose,

461
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,600
<19-9,JENNIFER>比赛结束时你都希望人们记住你
<19-9,JENNIFER>you want people to remember your name when it's over.

462
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,050
<19-9,JENNIFER>品牌就是这样建立的
<19-9,JENNIFER>That's how you build your brand.

463
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,300
<19-10,CASTLE>谁不会记住一位大反派呢
<19-10,CASTLE>And who doesn't remember a great villain?

464
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,140
<19-11,JENNIFER>没错  我们是为精彩的电视节目作秀
<19-11,JENNIFER>Exactly. Hey, we made for great TV.

465
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,200
<19-11,JENNIFER>不然他们为何留我们到决赛呢
<19-11,JENNIFER>Why do you think they kept us on until the final two?

466
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,600
<19-12,BECKETT>-但是他赢了  -我个人认为
<19-12,BECKETT>- But then he won.  - Personally, I was shocked that

467
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,890
<19-13,CASTLE>你的烘焙猪肚没有胜出真太令人吃惊了
<19-13,CASTLE>your oven-roasted pork belly glaze didn't take top prize.

468
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,290
<19-14,JENNIFER>-那真是  -我们都是赢家
<19-14,JENNIFER>- That was... just...  - But look, we both won.

469
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,900
<19-14,JENNIFER>没错  伍尔夫得到了自己的餐厅
<19-14,JENNIFER>Yes, Wolf got his own restaurant,

470
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,360
<19-14,JENNIFER>但我的宴会承办公司也得到了财政支持
<19-14,JENNIFER>but I secured financing for a catering company,

471
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,180
<19-14,JENNIFER>生意也不错
<19-14,JENNIFER>and I'm doing great.

472
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,310
<19-15,BECKETT>如果你没杀他
<19-15,BECKETT>Well, then if you didn't kill him,

473
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,450
<19-15,BECKETT>也许你能解释
<19-15,BECKETT>maybe you can explain

474
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,520
<19-15,BECKETT>在犯罪现场找到你指纹的原因
<19-15,BECKETT>why we found your prints at the scene.

475
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,290
<19-15,BECKETT>导使伍尔夫先生致命的器具上
<19-15,BECKETT>They were all over the appliance

476
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,270
<19-15,BECKETT>全是你的指纹
<19-15,BECKETT>used to bludgeon Mr. Wolf to death.

477
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,810
<19-16,JENNIFER>你说的是旋转蒸发器吗
<19-16,JENNIFER>Are you talking about the rotary evaporator?

478
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,450
<19-16,JENNIFER>有我的指纹是因为那是我的
<19-16,JENNIFER>My prints are on it because it's mine.

479
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,920
<19-16,JENNIFER>我前天借给他的
<19-16,JENNIFER>I loaned it to him the day before yesterday.

480
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,120
<19-16,JENNIFER>他说需要用来制作特色菜品
<19-16,JENNIFER>He said he needed it to make something really special.

481
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,020
<19-17,BECKETT>等等  他死亡当天你见过他
<19-17,BECKETT>Wait, you saw him the day he died?

482
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,220
<19-18,JENNIFER>他那天早上打给我  约我见面
<19-18,JENNIFER>He called me early in the morning and asked to meet.

483
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,350
<19-19,CASTLE>他拿着一个背包吗
<19-19,CASTLE>Was he carrying a backpack?

484
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,500
<19-19,CASTLE>是的
<19-19,CASTLE>Yeah.

485
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,580
<19-20,JENNIFER>他看起来很匆忙  好像是
<19-20,JENNIFER>He seemed in a rush, like he had

486
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,500
<19-20,JENNIFER>有很多事要做却不够时间
<19-20,JENNIFER>a lot of things to do and not a lot of time to do it.

487
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,750
<19-20,JENNIFER>我借给他蒸发器
<19-20,JENNIFER>I gave him the evaporator,

488
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,970
<19-20,JENNIFER>然后他说去市中心见一个人
<19-20,JENNIFER>and then he said he had a meeting in midtown.

489
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,570
<19-20,JENNIFER>他在我回家的路上下车了
<19-20,JENNIFER>He asked me to drop him off on my way home.

490
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,530
<19-21,BECKETT>那是哪里
<19-21,BECKETT>And where was that?

491
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,960
<19-22,JENNIFER>47号大街和莱克斯街的东北角
<19-22,JENNIFER>Uh, the Northeast corner of 47th and Lex

492
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,270
<19-22,JENNIFER>一栋写字大楼
<19-22,JENNIFER>One of those big office buildings.

493
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,250
<20-1,BECKETT>詹妮弗的雇员证实
<20-1,BECKETT>Jennifer's employees confirm

494
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,730
<20-1,BECKETT>她在汉普顿有一场承办的宴会
<20-1,BECKETT>that she had a catering job in the Hamptons

495
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,300
<20-1,BECKETT>她整晚都在那里
<20-1,BECKETT>and that she stayed the night.

496
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,580
<20-2,CASTLE>这很好
<20-2,CASTLE>Well, just as well.

497
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,840
<20-2,CASTLE>她的厨艺不会被埋没在监狱厨房了
<20-2,CASTLE>Her culinary talents would've been wasted in a prison kitchen.

498
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,260
<20-2,CASTLE>伙计们
<20-2,CASTLE>Hey, you guys.

499
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,800
<20-3,BECKETT>去查查这地址的承租人
<20-3,BECKETT>I need you to check on the tenants at this address.

500
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,250
<20-4,ESPOSITO>47号大街东423号
<20-4,ESPOSITO>423 East 47th?

501
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,400
<20-5,BECKETT>显然  伍尔夫死亡当天在那见了某个人
<20-5,BECKETT>Apparently, Wolf visited someone there the day that he died.

502
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,450
<20-6,CASTLE>他当时还拿着背包
<20-6,CASTLE>And he had the backpack with him.

503
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,820
<20-7,BECKETT>上东区那边进展如何
<20-7,BECKETT>Hey, how'd things go uptown?

504
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,910
<20-8,RYAN>我们盘查了雷克斯咖啡馆的
<20-8,RYAN>Well, we talked to every waiter,

505
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,790
<20-8,RYAN>所有服务生  打杂工和经理
<20-8,RYAN>busboy and manager at Cafe Rex.

506
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,540
<20-8,RYAN>他们记得伍尔夫去过  说他总是坐
<20-8,RYAN>They remember Wolf coming in and said he sat

507
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,980
<20-8,RYAN>前面的那张桌子
<20-8,RYAN>at the same table out front,

508
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,110
<20-9,BECKETT>-但他总是独自一人  -他在那里做什么
<20-9,BECKETT>- but he was always alone.  - What was he doing?

509
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,940
<20-10,ESPOSITO>-喝茶凝望  -有时还会点奶油蛋卷
<20-10,ESPOSITO>- Sipping tea, staring.  - Sometimes, he ordered the brioche.

510
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,170
<20-12,ESPOSITO>就这样吗  最近两星期天天如此吗
<20-12,ESPOSITO>That's it? Every day for the last two weeks?

511
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,090
<20-13,BECKETT>为什么他去上东区  却独自一人
<20-13,BECKETT>Why would he go all the way to the upper east side

512
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,680
<20-13,BECKETT>坐在那里
<20-13,BECKETT>just to sit there alone?

513
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,040
<20-14,CASTLE>也许他与命运有约
<20-14,CASTLE>Maybe he had a rendezvous with destiny,

514
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,370
<20-14,CASTLE>但被放了鸽子
<20-14,CASTLE>and it stood him up.

515
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,770
<20-14,CASTLE>这倒提醒我  你觉得
<20-14,CASTLE>Which reminds me, what color shirt

516
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,780
<20-14,CASTLE>麦蒂森喜欢我穿什么颜色的衬衫
<20-14,CASTLE>do you think Madison would like on me?

517
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,520
<21-1,MARTHA>和贝克特的老友约会
<21-1,MARTHA>Going out with Beckett's old friend?

518
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,620
<21-2,MARTHA>这可是个错误
<21-2,MARTHA>That's a mistake.

519
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,600
<21-3,CASTLE>-贝克特好像不介意  -亲爱的
<21-3,CASTLE>- Oh, Beckett didn't seem to mind.  - Oh, honey.

520
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,040
<21-5,CASTLE>帮我拿个苹果
<21-5,CASTLE>Do you want to hand me an apple?

521
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,470
<21-6,MARTHA>别皱眉了  阿丽克西斯
<21-6,MARTHA>Stop frowning, Alexis,

522
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,750
<21-6,MARTHA>不然你爸会把你的脸冻成那样
<21-6,MARTHA>or your father will freeze your face like that.

523
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,730
<21-7,ALEXIS>他不需要
<21-7,ALEXIS>He doesn't have to.

524
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,840
<21-7,ALEXIS>我刚发现我必须用显微镜观察载玻片
<21-7,ALEXIS>I just found out I have to study slides with a microscope

525
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,380
<21-7,ALEXIS>大学预修化学考试需要
<21-7,ALEXIS>for my AP Chem exam.

526
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,370
<21-7,ALEXIS>我不能带着显微镜去汉普顿
<21-7,ALEXIS>I can't take a microscope to the Hamptons.

527
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,680
<21-8,CASTLE>你要取消行程吗
<21-8,CASTLE>Oh, so you're canceling your trip?

528
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,020
<21-9,ALEXIS>当我学习时  我会想和姑娘们一起去沙滩
<21-9,ALEXIS>When I'm studying, I'll want to be on the beach with the girls,

529
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,800
<21-9,ALEXIS>而在沙滩时  我会因为不学习有罪恶感
<21-9,ALEXIS>and when I'm on the beach, I'll feel guilty for not studying.

530
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,610
<21-10,MARTHA>别看我
<21-10,MARTHA>Well, don't look at me.

531
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,210
<21-10,MARTHA>做决定的时候我从来都是"鱼和熊掌兼得"
<21-10,MARTHA>I'm from the "Have your cake and eat it, too" school

532
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,210
<21-10,MARTHA>要我说两个都去做
<21-10,MARTHA>of decision making. I say do both.

533
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,380
<21-11,CASTLE>或者到这个周末的时候
<21-11,CASTLE>Or maybe by this weekend,

534
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,290
<21-11,CASTLE>我可以想出法子把这瓶液氮
<21-11,CASTLE>I'll figure out a way to take this tank of liquid nitrogen

535
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,860
<21-11,CASTLE>安装在一个气象机器里
<21-11,CASTLE>and build it into a weather machine.

536
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,200
<21-11,CASTLE>我就可以呼风唤雨  你的朋友就得取消行程
<21-11,CASTLE>I'll make it rain, your friends will have to cancel their trip.

537
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,090
<21-11,CASTLE>你就不必选了
<21-11,CASTLE>You won't have to choose,

538
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,510
<21-11,CASTLE>然后我们就可以称霸全世界
<21-11,CASTLE>and then we can take over the world!

539
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,940
<21-12,ALEXIS>一点忙都帮不上
<21-12,ALEXIS>Not helpful.

540
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,890

<23-7,ROCCO>卡塞尔  我真想痛扁你的脸
<23-7,ROCCO>I ought to punch you in the face, Castle...

590
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,630
<23-7,ROCCO>谁让你杀死德里克·斯道姆

592
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,780
<23-7,ROCCO>当然《希特热浪》也很有趣
<23-7,ROCCO>But I'll admit, "Heat wave" is fun, too.

593
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,940
<23-8,MADISON>是以我的朋友凯特·贝克特作为原型的

<23-12,CASTLE>你真的认为他是贝克特喜欢的类型吗
<23-12,CASTLE>You... you really think he's Beckett's type?

601
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,500
<23-13,MADISON>小贝从没有固定喜欢的类型
<23-13,MADISON>Well, Becks never had a type.

602
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,550
<23-13,MADISON>她约会过垃圾乐队的吉他手
<23-13,MADISON>She dated a guitarist in a grunge band,

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,590
<23-13,MADISON>我非常肯定他是皇室成员之类的
<23-13,MADISON>but I'm pretty sure he was some kind of royalty.

605
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,410
<23-13,MADISON>她现在和谁约会?
<23-13,MADISON>Who is she seeing now?

606
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,740
<23-14,CASTLE>和某人
<23-14,CASTLE>Oh, just... some guy.

607
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,120
<23-14,CASTLE>我不看好他们
<23-14,CASTLE>I don't see it going anywhere.

608
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,390
<24-1,BECKETT>这顿饭太美味了
<24-1,BECKETT>This food's amazing.

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,890
<24-1,BECKETT>你从哪买来的
<24-1,BECKETT>Where did you get it from?

610
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,770
<24-2,TOM>洪记中国海餐厅
<24-2,TOM>Hung's China Sea.

611
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,160
<24-3,BECKETT>胡说  洪记不送餐上门
<24-3,BECKETT>Oh, get out. Hung's doesn't deliver.

612
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,740
<24-4,TOM>他会送餐给我
<24-4,TOM>Well, he delivers to me.

613
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,980
<24-4,TOM>洪先生有一块
<24-4,TOM>Mr. Hung had this medal--

614
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,270
<24-4,TOM>源自十五世纪明朝的奖牌
<24-4,TOM>a 15th-century chinese medal, Ming Dynasty.

615
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,440
<24-4,TOM>是家族流传下来的
<24-4,TOM>It was passed down through the generations, right?

616
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,900
<24-4,TOM>去年  这块奖牌连同一些现金
<24-4,TOM>Well, last year it was stolen along with some cash

617
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,670
<24-4,TOM>厨房用具及其它一起被偷了
<24-4,TOM>and some kitchen appliances and whatnot.

618
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,250
<24-4,TOM>对洪先生而言最重要的是那块奖牌
<24-4,TOM>The only thing that mattered to Mr. Hung was the medal.

619
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,940
<24-4,TOM>我把奖牌完璧归赵了
<24-4,TOM>So I got it back for him.

620
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,040
<24-4,TOM>我为他送去奖牌  他为我送来饭菜
<24-4,TOM>And because I delivered, now so does he.

621
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,870
<24-5,BECKETT>是嘛  那或许我应该找你帮忙查出
<24-5,BECKETT>Really? Well, then maybe I should get you to figure out

622
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,130
<24-5,BECKETT>受害人背着一个装满现金背包的原因
<24-5,BECKETT>why our victim was carrying a backpack full of cash.

623
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,380
<24-6,TOM>那你真应该这样做
<24-6,TOM>Well, maybe you should.

624
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,130
<24-6,TOM>知道吗  我在道上有线人
<24-6,TOM>You know, I got some guys on the street.

625
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,700
<24-6,TOM>如你有需要  我能帮你打听一下
<24-6,TOM>If you want, I can put out feelers,

626
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,420
<24-6,TOM>看看有没有人知道些什么
<24-6,TOM>see if anybody knows anything.

627
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,220
<24-7,BECKETT>这当然好了
<24-7,BECKETT>Yeah, sure.

<24-10,ESPOSITO>- Wow. Nice candle. - Come on in.

630
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,890
<24-11,BECKETT>有什么发现
<24-11,BECKETT>What'd you find?

631
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,800
<24-12,ESPOSITO>我们查看了詹妮弗·王送伍尔夫去的
<24-12,ESPOSITO>Well, we checked the sign-in log at that building

632
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,740
<24-12,ESPOSITO>那栋大厦的访客记录
<24-12,ESPOSITO>where Jennifer Wong dropped off Wolf.

633
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,960
<24-14,ESPOSITO>他是去见一位名为
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Turns out he was seeing a guy named

634
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,930
<24-14,ESPOSITO>西蒙·海姆的律师
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Simon Haim, esquire.

635
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,440
<24-15,BECKETT>他把装满现金的背包拿去给一个律师
<24-15,BECKETT>He was delivering a backpack full of cash to a lawyer?

636
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,720
<24-16,RYAN>根据海姆先生的供词
<24-16,RYAN>Well, according to Mr. Haim,

637
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,100
<24-16,RYAN>伍尔夫的确持有一个背包
<24-16,RYAN>Wolf had the backpack in his possession,

638
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,100
<24-16,RYAN>但他并没有打开
<24-16,RYAN>but he never opened it

639
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,370
<24-16,RYAN>也没有提及现金的事
<24-16,RYAN>and he never even mentioned the cash.

640
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,240
<24-17,ESPOSITO>但他提到了你的高中同学麦蒂森
<24-17,ESPOSITO>But he did mention your high school friend Madison.

641
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,560
<24-17,ESPOSITO>显然  伍尔夫想取消合同
<24-17,ESPOSITO>Apparently, Wolf wanted out of his contract.

642
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,720
<24-17,ESPOSITO>他想离开餐厅
<24-17,ESPOSITO>He wanted to leave the restaurant,

643
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,700
<24-17,ESPOSITO>并且想要退股
<24-17,ESPOSITO>and he wanted his investment back.

644
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,940
<24-18,TOM>但餐厅才刚开张
<24-18,TOM>But the restaurant just opened.

645
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,910
<24-18,TOM>他怎会想要离开
<24-18,TOM>Why would he want to leave?

646
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,260
<24-19,RYAN>经营理念分歧
<24-19,RYAN>Creative differences,

647
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,990
<24-19,RYAN>但凯勒小姐不肯放他走
<24-19,RYAN>but Ms. Queller refused to release him.

648
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,340
<24-19,RYAN>伍尔夫打算提出诉讼
<24-19,RYAN>Wolf was planning to sue.

649
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,800
<24-20,BECKETT>她的餐厅是靠伍尔夫的名声打出名堂的
<24-20,BECKETT>She'd built the restaurant on his reputation.

650
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,130
<24-20,BECKETT>他一旦离开  她就会失去一切
<24-20,BECKETT>If he left, she would've lost everything.

651
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,890
<24-20,BECKETT>现在伍尔夫死了  Q3归谁
<24-20,BECKETT>So what happens to Q3 now that Wolf is dead?

652
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,380
<24-21,ESPOSITO>她为伍尔夫买了商业保险
<24-21,ESPOSITO>She had business insurance on him.

653
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,970
<24-21,ESPOSITO>有了这笔赔偿
<24-21,ESPOSITO>So with the payout,

654
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,420
<24-21,ESPOSITO>麦蒂森就能轻而易举获得整个餐厅
<24-21,ESPOSITO>Madison gets the restaurant, free and clear.

655
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,450
<24-22,RYAN>伍尔夫的死让她免于在房地产
<24-22,RYAN>Wolf's death protects her from potentially

656
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,300
<24-22,RYAN>机械与设备上损失二百万美元
<24-22,RYAN>losing $2 million in real estate, appliances and fixtures.

657
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,100
<24-23,TOM>听起来像是杀人动机
<24-23,TOM>Sounds like motive to me.

658
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,640
<25-2,CASTLE>这真是...
<25-2,CASTLE>This... mmm.

659
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,100

<25-6,CASTLE>这真是
<25-6,CASTLE>This is...

<25-9,MADISON>Oh, well... how could I resist?

<25-10,CASTLE>那真是
<25-10,CASTLE>That is...

666
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,140
<25-11,BECKETT>抱歉打扰了
<25-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry to interrupt.

667
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,490
<25-12,MADISON>-你来了  -贝克特
<25-12,MADISON>- Hey. - Beckett.

<25-13,CASTLE>你在这里做什么
<25-13,CASTLE>What are you doing here?

669
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,940
<25-14,BECKETT>我有些问题要问麦蒂森
<25-14,BECKETT>I-I need to ask Madison a few questions.

670
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,250
<25-15,MADISON>行  拉张椅子过来坐
<25-15,MADISON>Oh, well, pull up a chair.

<25-16,BECKETT>Not here. Downtown.

672
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,140
<26-1,CASTLE>当你像个搞笑警察般踏进餐厅  你应该清楚
<26-1,CASTLE>You realize Madison and I weren't halfway through

673
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,180
<26-1,CASTLE>我和麦蒂森的试味套餐连一半都没有吃完
<26-1,CASTLE>our tasting menus when you stomped in there like the fun police?

674
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,010
<26-2,BECKETT>她是谋杀案的嫌疑人  这件事上
<26-2,BECKETT>What part of her being a suspect in a murder investigation

675
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,830
<26-2,BECKETT>你有哪点不懂呢
<26-2,BECKETT>do you not get?

676
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,740
<26-3,CASTLE>侍应正要端上
<26-3,CASTLE>The waiter was about to come out

681
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,540
<26-3,CASTLE>更过分就是我连配餐红酒都没喝上
<26-3,CASTLE>And don't even get me started on the wine pairings.

<27-12,BECKETT>你对我撒谎了  你知道
<27-12,BECKETT>You lied to me. You knew that

706
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,980
<27-12,BECKETT>伍尔夫想离开Q3
<27-12,BECKETT>Wolf wanted out of Q3,

707
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,040
<27-12,BECKETT>也知道他打算起诉你
<27-12,BECKETT>and you knew that he was gonna sue you.

708
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,390
<27-13,MADISON>你都知道了
<27-13,MADISON>You know about that?

<27-15,MADISON>Okay, but I didn't lie.

711
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,230
<27-15,MADISON>只是隐瞒了此事
<27-15,MADISON>I just neglected to say anything about it.

712
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,850
<27-15,MADISON>你知道在曼哈顿开一间餐厅有多难吗
<27-15,MADISON>Okay, you know how hard it is to open a restaurant in Manhattan?

713
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,010
<27-15,MADISON>如果伍尔夫想退出的消息传出去
<27-15,MADISON>If word got out that Wolf was trying to leave,

714
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,250
<27-15,MADISON>我就完蛋了
<27-15,MADISON>it would've ruined me.

715
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,350
<27-16,BECKETT>但是只要他死了
<27-16,BECKETT>But if he dies,

716
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,860
<27-16,BECKETT>靠着保险赔偿金  你就能应付自如
<27-16,BECKETT>with your insurance policy, you make out just fine.

717
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,550
<27-16,BECKETT>麦蒂  发生了什么  你们动手了吗
<27-16,BECKETT>So what happened, Maddie? Did you guys get into a fight?

718
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,600
<27-16,BECKETT>你向他扔东西了吗
<27-16,BECKETT>Did you throw something at him?

719
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,030
<27-16,BECKETT>因为我记得你生气时
<27-16,BECKETT>Because I remember you throwing things at people

720
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,290
<27-16,BECKETT>总喜欢向人扔东西
<27-16,BECKETT>when you got angry.

721
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,120
<27-17,MADISON>拜托
<27-17,MADISON>Oh, come on.

722
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,830
<27-17,MADISON>你们应该不允许用个人所知
<27-17,MADISON>Don't you people have rules

723
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,110
<27-17,MADISON>去指控嫌疑人
<27-17,MADISON>about using personal knowledge against suspects?

724
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,970
<27-18,BECKETT>麦蒂  你最好现在向我坦白
<27-18,BECKETT>Maddie, you better start being straight with me.

725
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,800
<27-18,BECKETT>小贝  我没杀他
<27-18,BECKETT>Becks, I didn't kill him.

726
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,790
<27-19,MADISON>两个星期前
<27-19,MADISON>Two weeks ago,

727
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,980
<27-19,MADISON>伍尔夫无缘无故说
<27-19,MADISON>Wolf tells me he wants out of the restaurant biz,

728
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,910
<27-19,MADISON>要退出餐厅的生意
<27-19,MADISON>completely out of nowhere.

729
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,700
<27-19,MADISON>他说想改变自己的生活
<27-19,MADISON>Says he's trying to change his life.

730
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,580
<27-19,MADISON>我当时以为他是被挖角了
<27-19,MADISON>Now I'm thinking he's being poached.

731
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,540
<27-19,MADISON>所以我开始为他提供更好的设备
<27-19,MADISON>So I start offering better equipment,

732
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,100
<27-19,MADISON>更多的分红  他想要的一切
<27-19,MADISON>a bigger piece in the business, whatever he wants.

733
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,160
<27-19,MADISON>但他坚持他真是要离开
<27-19,MADISON>He insists he's really getting out

734
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
<27-19,MADISON>我无法动摇他
<27-19,MADISON>and that I can't change his mind.

735
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,920
<27-19,MADISON>就像是他的人生发生了重大变化
<27-19,MADISON>It was like something changed in his life.

736
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,280
<27-19,MADISON>我正准备跟他解约
<27-19,MADISON>Now I was gonna let him out of his contract.

737
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,950
<27-19,MADISON>我只是需要时间找个新主厨
<27-19,MADISON>I just needed time to find a new chef.

738
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,870
<27-19,MADISON>但我发誓  小贝  我没杀他
<27-19,MADISON>But I swear, Becks, I didn't kill him.

739
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,180
<28-1,CASTLE>你不会真认为是她干的吧
<28-1,CASTLE>You don't really think she did it, do you?

740
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,360
<28-2,BECKETT>在她排除嫌疑之前
<28-2,BECKETT>Well, until I can rule her out,

741
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,840
<28-2,BECKETT>我怎么想不重要
<28-2,BECKETT>it doesn't matter what I think.

742
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,080
<28-3,CASTLE>-她有作案动机  -但也有不在场证明
<28-3,CASTLE>- She has motive.  - Yeah, she also has an alibi,

743
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,650
<28-3,CASTLE>你却一直忽视这个事实
<28-3,CASTLE>which you're conveniently ignoring.

744
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,180
<28-4,BECKETT>我没有忽视  我是在核实
<28-4,BECKETT>I'm not ignoring. I'm just rechecking.

745
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,350
<28-4,BECKETT>我让她无论如何都别离开
<28-4,BECKETT>I asked her to stay in town in any case.

746
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,820
<28-5,CASTLE>是  我知道  我听到了
<28-5,CASTLE>Yes, I know. I heard...

747
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,520
<28-5,CASTLE>每一句话
<28-5,CASTLE>everything.

748
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,410
<28-6,BECKETT>他卖掉了餐馆的股份
<28-6,BECKETT>So, uh, selling his stake in the restaurant,

749
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,990
<28-6,BECKETT>带着一个装满现金的背包
<28-6,BECKETT>a backpack full of cash...

750
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,800
<28-6,BECKETT>伍尔夫像是
<28-6,BECKETT>That sounds like Wolf was

751
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,110
<28-7,CASTLE>-准备要逃跑  -没错  但为什么逃呢
<28-7,CASTLE>- getting ready to run.  - Yes, but from what?

752
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,820
<28-8,DEMMING>-嘿  你们好  -嘿
<28-8,DEMMING>- Hey, you guys.  - Hey.

753
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,410
<28-9,BECKETT>-抱歉刚才中途放你鸽子  -没事
<28-9,BECKETT>- I'm so sorry to cut out on you earlier.  - No worries.

754
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,150
<28-10,DEMMING>-正好给我时间打听被害人的消息  -怎样
<28-10,DEMMING>- It gave me time to put the word out on your vic.  - And?

755
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,630
<28-11,BECKETT>我认识一个家伙  替本地庄家做文书工作
<28-11,BECKETT>Well, a guy I know runs paper for a local bookmaking ring.

756
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,390
<28-12,TOM>没想到他还是个美食家
<28-12,TOM>Turns out he's a bit of a foodie.

757
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,570
<28-12,TOM>他认出伍尔夫  在双桥酒吧找庄家下注
<28-12,TOM>He clocked Wolf doing business with a bookie at Two Bridges Bar.

758
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,610
<28-12,TOM>显然  被害人很喜欢赌大的
<28-12,TOM>Apparently, your boy likes to bet big.

759
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,740
<28-13,CASTLE>他和庄家有纠葛
<28-13,CASTLE>He was in deep with a bookie.

760
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,620
<28-14,BECKETT>这就解释了殴打伤痕和现金
<28-14,BECKETT>That explains the beating and the cash.

761
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,340
<28-14,BECKETT>你知道庄家的名字吗
<28-14,BECKETT>Does this bookie have a name?

762
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,250
<29-1,BECKETT>韦斯利·斯雷德
<29-1,BECKETT>Wesley Slade?

763
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,370
<29-1,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  纽约警察局的
<29-1,BECKETT>Detective Beckett, NYPD.

764
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,800
<29-1,BECKETT>我们在调查巴尔萨扎·伍尔夫的谋杀案
<29-1,BECKETT>We're investigating the murder of Balthazar Wolf.

765
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,170
<29-2,WESLEY>不认识他
<29-2,WESLEY>Never heard of him.

766
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,050
<29-3,BECKETT>是吗  你手下把他打的
<29-3,BECKETT>Really? Well, given the marks on his body

767
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,610
<29-3,BECKETT>满身伤痕  我认为
<29-3,BECKETT>after the beating your boys gave him,

768
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,660
<29-3,BECKETT>-你肯定认识  -怎么回事
<29-3,BECKETT>- I think you have.  - What happened?

769
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,690
<29-4,CASTLE>他欠债太多  所以你要他偿命
<29-4,CASTLE>He get in too deep with you, so you had to take him out?

770
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,060
<29-5,WESLEY>我不会跟个条子讲我的生意往来的
<29-5,WESLEY>You really think I'm gonna tell my business to a cop?

771
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,660
<29-6,BECKETT>要么交待  要么等着谋杀的指控吧
<29-6,BECKETT>It's either that or you face murder charges.

772
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,740
<29-6,BECKETT>那可对你的生意不利
<29-6,BECKETT>That can't be good for business.

773
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,290
<29-6,BECKETT>好吧
<29-6,BECKETT>All right.

774
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,920
<29-7,WESLEY>就假设说  他找我下注
<29-7,WESLEY>Let's say, hypothetically, that I made book for him.

775
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,580
<29-7,WESLEY>考虑到也有可能  他欠我很多钱
<29-7,WESLEY>And let's say for the sake of argument that he owed me a lot.

776
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,440
<29-8,CASTLE>-假设说  欠多少  -两万五
<29-8,CASTLE>- How much, hypothetically? - 25 thou,

777
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,550
<29-9,WESLEY>他可能还不了
<29-9,WESLEY>which maybe he couldn't pay.

778
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,990
<29-9,WESLEY>所以他可能需要一点"激励"
<29-9,WESLEY>So maybe he needed some encouragement.

779
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,710
<29-10,BECKETT>可能"激励"的太过了点
<29-10,BECKETT>Maybe the encouragement went too far.

780
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,740
<29-11,WESLEY>也有可能恰到好处
<29-11,WESLEY>Or maybe it was the right amount.

781
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,830
<29-11,WESLEY>所以他才能还了钱  走上幸福大道
<29-11,WESLEY>So he paid what he owed and went his merry way.

782
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,800
<29-12,BECKETT>什么时候
<29-12,BECKETT>When?

783
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,150
<29-13,WESLEY>他死的那天  带着一背包现金来
<29-13,WESLEY>The day he died, he comes in with a backpack full of cash,

784
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,800
<29-13,WESLEY>放了两万五到桌子上  要回了他的戒指
<29-13,WESLEY>puts 25 thou on the table and asks for his ring back.

785
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,870
<29-14,CASTLE>戒指  什么样的戒指
<29-14,CASTLE>His ring? What kind of ring?

786
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,810
<29-15,WESLEY>订婚钻戒
<29-15,WESLEY>Diamond engagement ring.

787
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,520
<29-16,BECKETT>怎么在你手上
<29-16,BECKETT>Why'd you have it?

788
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,640
<29-16,BECKETT>假设的说
<29-16,BECKETT>Hypothetically.

789
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,390
<29-17,WESLEY>两星期前  我派手下去收钱
<29-17,WESLEY>Couple of weeks back, I sent my guys to collect, didn't

790
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,960
<29-17,WESLEY>他没钱  讲了他和某个女人的烂故事
<29-17,WESLEY>have the money, gave some sob story about a woman,

791
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,370
<29-17,WESLEY>说他花光所有积蓄买了个钻戒
<29-17,WESLEY>how he spent everything he had on a diamond ring.

792
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,060
<29-17,WESLEY>当我手下准备"激励"他一下的时候
<29-17,WESLEY>So when my guys go to give him some... encouragement,

793
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,100
<29-17,WESLEY>猜猜发现了什么  一枚漂亮的钻戒
<29-17,WESLEY>Oh, what do they find? A nice diamond ring.

794
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,060
<29-17,WESLEY>很大颗  够抵一万  甚至一万五的欠债
<29-17,WESLEY>Nice. Must have set him back 10, 15 grand... of my money.

795
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,820
<29-18,CASTLE>于是你的手下就拿了那个当抵押
<29-18,CASTLE>So your guys took it for collateral?

796
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,350
<29-19,WESLEY>不  是当作还钱的动机
<29-19,WESLEY>No, as incentive.

797
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,840
<29-19,WESLEY>效果不错
<29-19,WESLEY>And it worked.

798
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,240
<29-19,WESLEY>我拿到了钱  他拿回了戒指
<29-19,WESLEY>I got my money, he got his ring,

799
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,930
<29-19,WESLEY>他是活着回去的  假设的说
<29-19,WESLEY>and he goes home alive... hypothetically.

800
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,300
<29-20,CASTLE>订婚钻戒完全能解释这一切
<29-20,CASTLE>An engagement ring makes perfect sense.

801
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,200
<29-20,CASTLE>他和迈尔斯太太分手
<29-20,CASTLE>That's why he broke things off with Mrs. Meyers.

802
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,370
<29-20,CASTLE>两星期前他从帐户里取了一万五千美元
<29-20,CASTLE>That's why he took $15,000 out of his account 2 weeks ago.

803
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,180
<29-21,BECKETT>那戒指在哪里呢
<29-21,BECKETT>Well, then where is it?

804
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,710
<29-21,BECKETT>他拿到戒指就回餐厅了
<29-21,BECKETT>He went to the restaurant right after,

805
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,690
<29-21,BECKETT>在犯罪现场我们也没找到
<29-21,BECKETT>and we didn't find it at the crime scene.

806
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,810
<29-22,CASTLE>也许我们找到了  只是不知道而已
<29-22,CASTLE>Unless we did find it and we just didn't know it.

807
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,690
<30-1,MAN>径直往后走
<30-1,MAN>Just straight back.

808
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,050
<30-2,CASTLE>谢谢  记得斯派克说伍尔夫
<30-2,CASTLE>Thank you. You remember what Spike was saying

809
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,940
<30-2,CASTLE>迟迟没走的原因吗
<30-2,CASTLE>about why Wolf was staying late?

810
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,620
<30-3,BECKETT>记得  他在做那个蛋糕
<30-3,BECKETT>Yeah, he was finishing off that cake.

811
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,910
<30-3,BECKETT>一个
<30-3,BECKETT>A cake...

812
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,110
<30-4,CASTLE>带心形模型的蛋糕
<30-4,CASTLE>with a heart-shaped mold on it.

813
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,350
<30-4,CASTLE>他不是打算逃跑
<30-4,CASTLE>He wasn't running away.

814
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,940
<30-5,BECKETT>而是准备求婚
<30-5,BECKETT>He was going to propose.

815
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,210
<30-5,BECKETT>向谁求婚呢
<30-5,BECKETT>But to who?

816
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,890
<30-5,BECKETT>而且她为何还没出现呢
<30-5,BECKETT>And why hasn't she come forward yet?

817
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,300
<30-6,CASTLE>她可能是害怕  可能她正面临危险
<30-6,CASTLE>Maybe she's scared. Maybe she's in danger.

818
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,530
<30-7,BECKETT>还可能是她杀了他
<30-7,BECKETT>Or maybe she killed him.

819
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,210
<31-1,MARTHA>谁会把订婚戒指放蛋糕里面
<31-1,MARTHA>Who puts an engagement ring inside a cake?

820
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,210
<31-2,CASTLE>很浪漫啊
<31-2,CASTLE>It's romantic.

821
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,840
<31-3,MARTHA>得了吧  那会噎死人的
<31-3,MARTHA>Oh, pl-- it's a choking hazard.

822
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,920
<31-3,MARTHA>我敢说  男人求婚时总做些奇怪的事
<31-3,MARTHA>I swear, men act as though there's some cosmic reward

823
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,310
<31-3,MARTHA>以为会有超级大奖等着
<31-3,MARTHA>for crazy proposals.

824
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,440
<31-3,MARTHA>而一个女人要的只是
<31-3,MARTHA>And what a woman really wants is

825
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,860
<31-3,MARTHA>男人单膝跪地
<31-3,MARTHA>a man down on one knee,

826
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,450
<31-3,MARTHA>双眼含泪  手捧钻戒
<31-3,MARTHA>tears in his eyes, ring in his hand.

827
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,290
<31-4,CASTLE>我对吉娜的求婚非常浪漫
<31-4,CASTLE>My proposal to Gina was very romantic.

828
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,420
<31-5,MARTHA>热气球升空是不错  但不该在二月
<31-5,MARTHA>A balloon ride is lovely, but not in February.

829
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,220
<31-6,CASTLE>因为寒冷  她的手的确抖个不停
<31-6,CASTLE>Her hand was shaking so much from the cold,

830
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,790
<31-6,CASTLE>-连戒指都戴不上  -那是个预兆
<31-6,CASTLE>- it was difficult getting that ring on.  - It was a sign.

831
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,740
<31-6,CASTLE>你决定了没
<31-6,CASTLE>So have you decided?

832
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,300
<31-6,CASTLE>没
<31-6,CASTLE>No.

833
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,730
<32-1,BECKETT>大卫  再次为你失去亲人深表遗憾
<32-1,BECKETT>Again, David, I'm sorry for your loss.

834
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,680
<32-2,CASTLE>有发现没
<32-2,CASTLE>Shed any light?

835
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,880
<32-3,BECKETT>大卫说要不是我把戒指给他看
<32-3,BECKETT>So David said that he wouldn't have believed it

836
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,400
<32-3,BECKETT>他都不会相信
<32-3,BECKETT>unless I'd shown him the ring.

837
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,150
<32-3,BECKETT>他不知道伍尔夫要向谁求婚
<32-3,BECKETT>He had no idea who Wolf was proposing to,

838
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,500
<32-3,BECKETT>他身边的其他人也不知道
<32-3,BECKETT>and neither did anyone else in his life.

839
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,360
<32-3,BECKETT>就像他在和鬼魂恋爱一样
<32-3,BECKETT>It's like the guy was in love with a ghost.

840
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,580
<32-4,CASTLE>如果真是鬼魂的话  就太酷了
<32-4,CASTLE>Ooh, that'd be cool, if it was actually a ghost.

841
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,720
<32-5,RYAN>重新查看了餐厅和
<32-5,RYAN>Went back through the phone logs

842
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,310
<32-5,RYAN>伍尔夫手机的电话记录
<32-5,RYAN>from the restaurant and Wolf's cell.

843
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,450
<32-5,RYAN>每通电话都事出有因
<32-5,RYAN>Every call's accounted for.

844
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,590
<32-6,BECKETT>那上东区的咖啡馆情况如何
<32-6,BECKETT>What about the cafe uptown?

845
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,940
<32-7,ESPOSITO>所有的员工都询问过了
<32-7,ESPOSITO>The waitstaff all checked out.

846
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,890
<32-7,ESPOSITO>他们肯定伍尔夫从未见过任何人
<32-7,ESPOSITO>They're adamant that Wolf never met anybody there.

847
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,460
<32-8,CASTLE>怎么可能不留任何痕迹的
<32-8,CASTLE>How do you have a relationship with somebody

848
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,750
<32-8,CASTLE>和别人展开恋情呢
<32-8,CASTLE>without leaving any evidence?

849
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,040
<32-9,ESPOSITO>可能那不是他的戒指
<32-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe the ring wasn't his.

850
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,680
<32-9,ESPOSITO>也许他只是替某个朋友保管着
<32-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe he was holding it for a friend.

851
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,340
<32-10,CASTLE>不  肯定是他的  想想他的行为
<32-10,CASTLE>No, it had to be his. Look at his behavior--

852
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:04,020
<32-10,CASTLE>他不再四处鬼混  还了债款
<32-10,CASTLE>He stops sleeping around, he was paying off his debts,

853
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,800
<32-10,CASTLE>他卖掉了生命中唯一在乎的东西
<32-10,CASTLE>he sold the one thing in life he actually cared about

854
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,480
<32-10,CASTLE>就为了换回那枚戒指
<32-10,CASTLE>just to get that ring back.

855
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,460
<32-10,CASTLE>只有一个原因能让男人悔过自新
<32-10,CASTLE>There's only one reason a man cleans up his act.

856
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,190
<32-12,BECKETT>但用谋杀来回应求婚不合常理
<32-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but murder isn't the usual response to a proposal.

857
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,120
<32-13,CASTLE>除非那女人怕失去已有的身边人
<32-13,CASTLE>Unless you got something to lose.

858
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,560
<32-14,ESPOSITO>他的确喜欢已婚妇女
<32-14,ESPOSITO>He did like married women.

859
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,810
<32-15,BECKETT>好  让鉴证组重新检查他的公寓
<32-15,BECKETT>All right. Have CSU resweep his apartment.

860
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,490
<32-15,BECKETT>若那个女孩在那里待过
<32-15,BECKETT>If this girl spent any time there,

861
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,150
<32-15,BECKETT>肯定会留下一些痕迹
<32-15,BECKETT>she must have left some evidence behind.

862
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,350
<32-15,BECKETT>嘿  麦蒂  感谢你赶来
<32-15,BECKETT>Hey, Maddie. Thanks for coming.

863
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,230
<32-16,MADISON>你不是说我已排除嫌疑了吗
<32-16,MADISON>I thought you said I was off the hook.

864
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,430
<32-17,BECKETT>是的  有证人看到你
<32-17,BECKETT>Yeah, uh, witnesses have you

865
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,000
<32-17,BECKETT>在被害者死前一直待在聚会上
<32-17,BECKETT>at the party until after the time of death.

866
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,360
<32-18,MADISON>那还叫我来干什么
<32-18,MADISON>Then why am I here?

867
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,870
<33-1,MADISON>有人给过你这个吗
<33-1,MADISON>Anyone ever offered you one of these?

868
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,050
<33-2,BECKETT>没有  你呢
<33-2,BECKETT>No. You?

869
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,110
<33-3,MADISON>还没有
<33-3,MADISON>Not yet.

870
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,760
<33-3,MADISON>我都不知道伍尔夫会对谁动真情
<33-3,MADISON>I had no idea Wolf was even serious with anyone.

871
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,850
<33-4,BECKETT>你记得他和谁走的比较近吗
<33-4,BECKETT>Can you think of any girl that he was close to?

872
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,170
<33-5,MADISON>每次看到他  身边都是不同的人
<33-5,MADISON>Every time I saw him, he was with someone different.

873
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,020
<33-5,MADISON>很难相信他会对谁许下承诺
<33-5,MADISON>It's hard to believe he'd ever commit.

874
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,100
<34-1,ESPOSITO>那家伙全天候的工作  肯定是
<34-1,ESPOSITO>The guy lived his job 24/7. It had to be somebody

875
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,950
<34-2,CASTLE>-餐厅里的某个人  -不一定
<34-2,CASTLE>- at the restaurant.  - Not necessarily.

876
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,390
<34-2,CASTLE>我曾经喜欢过地铁里某个陌生女人
<34-2,CASTLE>I've fallen in love with random women on the subway.

877
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,270
<34-2,CASTLE>如果你想到了谁  给我打电话
<34-2,CASTLE>Well, if you can think of anyone, call me.

878
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,680
<34-2,CASTLE>好  还有  小贝
<34-2,CASTLE>Yeah. And, Becks...

879
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,580
<35-1,BECKETT>对不起
<35-1,BECKETT>I'm sorry...

880
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,890
<35-2,MADISON>我不该撒谎
<35-2,MADISON>about lying to you.

881
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,300
<35-2,MADISON>我办案手法可能也
<35-2,MADISON>And I might have come down

882
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,930
<35-3,BECKETT>有点过于强硬了
<35-3,BECKETT>a little harder than I needed to.

883
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,870
<35-3,BECKETT>我曾经一度十分爱慕接线员
<35-3,BECKETT>I've fallen I love with operators on the phone.

884
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,260
<36-1,RYAN>几年前  还打算约一位见面
<36-1,RYAN>Even asked one out a couple of years ago,

885
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,890
<36-1,RYAN>可是她却身在孟加拉国
<36-1,RYAN>but she was in Bangladesh.

886
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,490
<36-1,RYAN>也许是因为我没把你看做警察
<36-1,RYAN>Yeah, I guess I wasn't seeing you as a cop,

887
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,210
<36-1,RYAN>而是看作我的朋友  看作是那个
<36-1,RYAN>but as my friend-- you know, the girl

888
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,420
<37-1,MADISON>偷妈妈的化妆品给我化妆的女孩
<37-1,MADISON>who stole her mom's makeup to give me a makeover.

889
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,750
<37-1,MADISON>第一个告诉我
<37-1,MADISON>The first who told me

890
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,240
<37-1,MADISON>和男孩接吻时  舌头也要参与其中的女孩
<37-1,MADISON>that kissing boys might involve some tongue.

891
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,760
<37-2,BECKETT>是的
<37-2,BECKETT>Oh, yeah.

892
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,690
<37-2,BECKETT>我曾接连两个月都去买炸豆泥三明治
<37-2,BECKETT>I bought a falafel from this stand every day for two months

893
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,000
<38-1,ESPOSITO>只为了和卖三明治的女孩说上几句
<38-1,ESPOSITO>just so I could talk to the falafel girl.

894
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,830
<38-2,RYAN>再比如说戴明每天早晨都跑来
<38-2,RYAN>Yeah, you mean like Demming showing up

895
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,280
<38-2,RYAN>喝咖啡  就是为了能见到贝克特
<38-2,RYAN>every morning for coffee just to run into Beckett?

896
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,510
<38-2,RYAN>想到什么了
<38-2,RYAN>What?

897
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,230
<38-2,RYAN>同样是那个女孩拖着我
<38-2,RYAN>The one who dragged me

898
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,260
<38-2,RYAN>站在布伦特·爱德华兹的豪宅外几个小时
<38-2,RYAN>to stand outside Brent Edwards' brownstone for hours

899
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,680
<39-1,MADISON>就是为了能透过窗户看他一眼
<39-1,MADISON>on end just to catch a glimpse of him through the window.

900
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,990
<39-2,BECKETT>透过窗户
<39-2,BECKETT>Through the window.

901
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,800
<40-1,CASTLE>伍尔夫不是去雷克斯咖啡馆见他的女友
<40-1,CASTLE>Wolf wasn't going to Cafe Rex to meet his girl.

902
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,360
<40-2,BECKETT>而是透过咖啡馆的玻璃窗看她
<40-2,BECKETT>He was watching her out the cafe window.

903
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,610
<40-3,CASTLE>这就解释了为什么没有电话记录
<40-3,CASTLE>That's why there were no phone calls.

904
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,870
<40-4,BECKETT>他在鼓起勇气向她求婚
<40-4,BECKETT>He was trying to gather up the courage to propose to her.

905
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,670
<40-4,BECKETT>这就是从咖啡馆  看得最清楚的店铺
<40-4,BECKETT>So that's the store with the clearest view from the cafe.

906
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,400
<41-1,BECKETT>要么我们的神秘女孩在这里工作
<41-1,BECKETT>Well, either our mystery girl works here,

907
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,490
<41-2,CASTLE>要么就是伍尔夫对女式服装很着迷
<41-2,CASTLE>or Wolf was really into women's clothes.

908
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,740
<41-2,CASTLE>也许是他
<41-2,CASTLE>Maybe it's him.

909
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,620
<41-2,CASTLE>也许那就是伍尔夫的秘友
<41-2,CASTLE>Maybe that's Wolf's big secret.

910
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,110
<41-3,BECKETT>那人不会是他的秘友
<41-3,BECKETT>That's not his secret.

911
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,770
<41-3,BECKETT>她才是
<41-3,BECKETT>She is.

912
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
<41-4,CASTLE>那是他义兄的女友
<41-4,CASTLE>That's his foster brother's girlfriend.

913
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,530
<41-5,BECKETT>不错
<41-5,BECKETT>Yep.

914
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,920
<41-6,CASTLE>这的确会让求婚变得比较棘手
<41-6,CASTLE>Well, it definitely made proposing tricky.

915
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,940
<42-1,CECILY>我不明白  我为什么会被带到这
<42-1,CECILY>I don't understand. Why am I here?

916
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,430
<42-2,BECKETT>你和伍尔夫关系如何  茜茜莉
<42-2,BECKETT>How well did you know Wolf, Cecily?

917
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,760
<42-3,CECILY>他就像家人一样
<42-3,CECILY>He was like family.

918
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,910
<42-4,BECKETT>就是说你认识他很长时间了
<42-4,BECKETT>So you knew him for a long time.

919
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,560
<42-5,CECILY>十年了  自从大卫的爸爸雇我
<42-5,CECILY>Well, ten years, ever since David's father

920
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,960
<42-5,CECILY>在他的餐馆工作开始
<42-5,CECILY>hired me at his restaurant.

921
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,370
<42-6,BECKETT>你们有没有过...
<42-6,BECKETT>Did the two of you ever...

922
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,840
<42-7,CECILY>为什么问我这个
<42-7,CECILY>Why are you asking me this?

923
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,490
<42-7,CECILY>最近的两个星期
<42-7,CECILY>Every day for the last two weeks,

924
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,170
<42-8,BECKETT>伍尔夫一直去雷克斯咖啡馆
<42-8,BECKETT>Wolf went to Cafe Rex,

925
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,080
<42-8,BECKETT>就在你工作店铺的马路对面
<42-8,BECKETT>which is right across the street from where you work.

926
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,080
<42-8,BECKETT>他只是坐在那里  看着窗外
<42-8,BECKETT>He would just sit there and look out the window.

927
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,880
<42-9,CASTLE>在看你
<42-9,CASTLE>Looking at you.

928
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,070
<42-10,BECKETT>他为什么这么做
<42-10,BECKETT>Now why would he do that?

929
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,340
<42-12,BECKETT>-我不知道  -我认为你知道
<42-12,BECKETT>- I don't know.  - I think you do.

930
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,400
<42-13,CASTLE>在最近的两周里  伍尔夫做了很多改变
<42-13,CASTLE>In the last two weeks, Wolf made a lot of changes.

931
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,530
<42-13,CASTLE>不再到处鬼混  偿还了债务
<42-13,CASTLE>He'd stopped sleeping around, paid off all his debts...

932
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,880
<42-14,BECKETT>而且给你买了这个
<42-14,BECKETT>And he bought this... for you.

933
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,470
<42-15,CASTLE>是什么使一个十年间
<42-15,CASTLE>What makes a man-- a self-professed bad boy--

934
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,030
<42-15,CASTLE>臭名昭著的坏小子突然转变了呢
<42-15,CASTLE>Suddenly declare himself after ten years?

935
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,390
<42-15,CASTLE>除非有什么事发生了
<42-15,CASTLE>Unless something changed.

936
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,100
<42-16,BECKETT>茜茜莉  这些是你的电话记录
<42-16,BECKETT>Cecily, these are your phone records.

937
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:31,570
<42-16,BECKETT>四个月前  你开始定期打电话给妇产科医生
<42-16,BECKETT>Four months ago, you started calling your ob/gyn regularly.

938
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,460
<42-16,BECKETT>你怀孕了  是伍尔夫的孩子  对吗
<42-16,BECKETT>You're pregnant. It's Wolf's, isn't it?

939
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,660
<42-17,CECILY>原以为没人会知道
<42-17,CECILY>No one was supposed to know.

940
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,640
<42-17,CECILY>这是我的秘密
<42-17,CECILY>It was supposed to be my secret.

941
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,270
<42-17,CECILY>但是当大卫告诉伍尔夫我怀孕了
<42-17,CECILY>But when David told Wolf we were pregnant,

942
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,320
<42-17,CECILY>他不知怎么就明白了
<42-17,CECILY>Somehow he knew.

943
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,340
<42-17,CECILY>他就...明白了
<42-17,CECILY>He... he knew.

944
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,400
<42-17,CECILY>上帝  你一定认为我糟糕透了
<42-17,CECILY>God, you must think I'm awful.

945
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,110
<42-18,BECKETT>我无法评判  但我旨在寻求真相
<42-18,BECKETT>It's not my job to judge. I'm just here to get the truth.

946
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
<42-19,CECILY>大卫的父亲去世了
<42-19,CECILY>David's father had just died,

947
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,820
<42-19,CECILY>所以他离开这里
<42-19,CECILY>so David went out of the country

948
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,940
<42-19,CECILY>去家乡安葬他的父亲
<42-19,CECILY>to bury his father in his hometown.

949
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,000
<42-19,CECILY>伍尔夫过来了
<42-19,CECILY>Wolf came by.

950
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,530
<42-19,CECILY>他握着我的手  我想起...
<42-19,CECILY>He held my hand, and I remembered...

951
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,970
<42-19,CECILY>我是多么的爱他  一直深爱着他
<42-19,CECILY>How much I loved him, that I'd always loved him.

952
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,590
<42-20,CASTLE>既然爱他  为什么和大卫在一起
<42-20,CASTLE>If you loved him so much, why stay with David?

953
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,810
<42-21,CECILY>因为大卫不会丢下我
<42-21,CECILY>Because David doesn't leave.

954
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,720
<42-21,CECILY>大卫不会和遇见的每个女孩都上床
<42-21,CECILY>David doesn't sleep with every girl who walks by.

955
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,020
<42-21,CECILY>你不会明白
<42-21,CECILY>You have no idea how hard it is

956
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,990
<42-21,CECILY>爱一个明知会让你心碎的男人是多么辛苦
<42-21,CECILY>to love someone, knowing they're gonna break your heart.

957
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,300
<42-21,CECILY>如果我无法相信他是个好男人
<42-21,CECILY>If I couldn't trust him as a man,

958
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,810
<42-21,CECILY>又怎能相信他会是个好父亲
<42-21,CECILY>how could he be a father?

959
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,300
<42-21,CECILY>我得做出选择
<42-21,CECILY>I had to make a choice.

960
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,960
<42-21,CECILY>上帝啊  别让大卫知道
<42-21,CECILY>Oh, god. Please don't tell David.

961
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,610
<42-22,BECKETT>你确定他还不知道吗
<42-22,BECKETT>Are you sure he doesn't already know?

962
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,780
<42-22,BECKETT>伍尔夫被谋杀的当晚  他在哪
<42-22,BECKETT>Where was he the night that Wolf was murdered?

963
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,670
<42-23,CECILY>家里...  和我躺在床上
<42-23,CECILY>At home... with me in bed.

964
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,910
<42-24,CASTLE>整晚
<42-24,CASTLE>All night?

965
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,870
<42-25,CECILY>老天
<42-25,CECILY>Oh, god.

966
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
<42-26,BECKETT>怎么了
<42-26,BECKETT>What?

967
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,860
<42-27,CECILY>我一直都有睡眠问题
<42-27,CECILY>I had been having trouble sleeping.

968
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,110
<42-27,CECILY>所以大卫给了我安眠药
<42-27,CECILY>So David gave me a pill,

969
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,310
<42-27,CECILY>是那种医生说很安全的
<42-27,CECILY>the kind the doctor said was okay.

970
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,190
<42-27,CECILY>他只有那晚给了我安眠药
<42-27,CECILY>It was the only time he's ever given me a pill.

971
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,100
<42-27,CECILY>伙计  带他去拘留所
<42-27,CECILY>Hey, man. Take him to the hole, please?

972
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,980
<42-27,CECILY>把他关起来  我们待会儿过去
<42-27,CECILY>Yeah, lock him up. We'll be right over.

973
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,410
<42-27,CECILY>我们走
<42-27,CECILY>Come on. Let's go.

974
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,330
<43-1,ESPOSITO>-他什么也不说  -是的  也无须说什么
<43-1,ESPOSITO>- He's not talking.  - Yeah, but he didn't have to.

975
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,250
<43-2,RYAN>在他们的公寓里找到了伍尔夫的背包
<43-2,RYAN>We found Wolf's backpack in their apartment

976
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,430
<43-2,RYAN>还有剩下的那些现金
<43-2,RYAN>along with the extra cash.

977
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,870
<43-3,ESPOSITO>还发现了他的一双鞋子
<43-3,ESPOSITO>We also found a pair of his shoes

978
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,620
<43-3,ESPOSITO>鞋底因沾上液氮裂开了
<43-3,ESPOSITO>with cracked soles from the liquid nitrogen.

979
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,530
<43-4,RYAN>无法想象被兄弟背叛的感觉
<43-4,RYAN>I can't imagine the betrayal he must have felt.

980
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,970
<43-5,BECKETT>这不是杀人的借口
<43-5,BECKETT>It's still not an excuse to kill.

981
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,410
<43-6,CASTLE>要我说...
<43-6,CASTLE>You ask me...

982
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,900
<43-6,CASTLE>她应该听从心声
<43-6,CASTLE>She should've followed her heart--

983
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,560
<43-6,CASTLE>离开大卫  和伍尔夫在一起
<43-6,CASTLE>Left David, gone with Wolf.

984
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,800
<43-7,BECKETT>我能理解留在大卫身边所体现的原则
<43-7,BECKETT>You know, I can see the virtue in staying.

985
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,620
<43-7,BECKETT>我意思是  像伍尔夫这类人  凭空出现
<43-7,BECKETT>I mean, guys like Wolf, they come in,

986
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,110
<43-7,BECKETT>扰乱你的生活步骤
<43-7,BECKETT>they upset the apple cart.

987
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,590
<43-7,BECKETT>当然也会使你觉得生机勃勃
<43-7,BECKETT>Of course he makes you feel alive,

988
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,070
<43-7,BECKETT>但最终你会明白  他只会让你失望
<43-7,BECKETT>but eventually, you know he's just gonna let you down.

989
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,340
<43-7,BECKETT>所以干嘛冒险呢
<43-7,BECKETT>So why risk it?

990
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,770
<43-8,CASTLE>因为情之所系  心之所在
<43-8,CASTLE>Because the heart wants what the heart wants.

991
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,420
<43-8,CASTLE>说到这
<43-8,CASTLE>Speaking of...

992
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,100
<43-8,CASTLE>我该走了
<43-8,CASTLE>I gotta get outta here.

993
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,540
<43-10,CASTLE>-约了麦蒂森吗  -不是  最近发生的事情太多
<43-10,CASTLE>- Madison? - No. Actually, with everything going on,

994
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,880
<43-10,CASTLE>她说没时间约会了
<43-10,CASTLE>She said she didn't have time to date.

995
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,040
<43-10,CASTLE>她没和你说吗
<43-10,CASTLE>She didn't tell you that?

996
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,510
<43-12,CASTLE>我得回家了
<43-12,CASTLE>So I gotta get home.

997
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,580
<43-12,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯被同样的问题困扰着
<43-12,CASTLE>Alexis has a little head-heart problem of her own,

998
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,670
<43-12,CASTLE>她拿主意时我要在一旁支持她
<43-12,CASTLE>and I want to be there for the decision.

<44-4,ALEXIS>感觉糟透了  但不管怎样  都是一样的
<44-4,ALEXIS>I feel awful about it, but either way, it's the same.

<44-11,CASTLE>You won't be thanking me when you see

1037

<44-11,CASTLE>你就不会谢我了
<44-11,CASTLE>what I have planned for this weekend.

1038
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,680
<44-11,CASTLE>有1001个方法干扰人们学习
<44-11,CASTLE>1,001 ways to distract someone who's studying.

1039
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,100
<44-11,CASTLE>就以冰镇乒乓球开始吧
<44-11,CASTLE>We start by freezing ping-pong balls.

1044
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,470
<45-3,MADISON>我找到了替代伍尔夫的合适人选
<45-3,MADISON>I found a hot new chef to step into Wolf's shoes.

1045
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,270
<45-4,BECKETT>-那太好了  -确实
<45-4,BECKETT>- Oh, that's so great.  - Yeah.

<45-6,JENNIFER>Hello, Detective. You're not here to question me again?

1047
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,650
<45-7,BECKETT>不会  以朋友的身份来的
<45-7,BECKETT>No, I'm just here as a friend.

00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,990
<45-8,JENNIFER>-祝贺你  -谢谢
<45-8,JENNIFER>- Congratulations.  - Thank you.

1049
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,410
<45-9,MADISON>是大卫杀了伍尔夫
<45-9,MADISON>So David killed Wolf?

1050
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,830
<45-10,BECKETT>是的  他看到了一条伍尔夫给茜茜莉的
<45-10,BECKETT>Yeah. It turns out that he intercepted a text

1051
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,680
<45-10,BECKETT>询问关于腹中宝宝的短信
<45-10,BECKETT>that Wolf sent Cecily asking about the baby.

1052
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,490
<45-10,BECKETT>起初  他打算找茜茜莉谈这件事的
<45-10,BECKETT>And at first, he was gonna approach Cecily about it

1053
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,730
<45-10,BECKETT>可他意识到只要伍尔夫还活着
<45-10,BECKETT>until he realized that eventually she would leave him

1054
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,240
<45-10,BECKETT>她最终会选择离开
<45-10,BECKETT>as long as Wolf was alive.
