26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,620
<1-1,ALEXIS>"一声尖叫破空而来
<1-1,ALEXIS>"A scream pierced the air,

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,500
<1-1,ALEXIS>却只传入了死者的耳中"
<1-1,ALEXIS>falling only on the deaf ears of the dead."

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,590
<1-2,CASTLE>-你确定  -太夸张了吗
<1-2,CASTLE>- Really? - A little too over the top?

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,200
<1-3,ALEXIS>我觉得你写太久了以至于
<1-3,ALEXIS>I think you've been writing too long

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,880
<1-3,ALEXIS>忘记"I在E前  除非是跟在C后面"[单词拼写记忆法]
<1-3,ALEXIS>not to know that it's "I" before "E" except after "C."

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,880
<1-3,ALEXIS>-没听说过"拼写检查"吗  -当然
<1-3,ALEXIS>- Ever heard of spell-check? - Yes, of course.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,760
<1-4,CASTLE>她有红色的头发  远远超出年龄的智慧
<1-4,CASTLE>She's got red hair, she's wise beyond her years,

33
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,890
<1-4,CASTLE>她还会告诉她老爸
<1-4,CASTLE>and she's about to tell her dad what she thinks

34
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,320
<1-4,CASTLE>他新书最新一章写的如何
<1-4,CASTLE>of the latest chapter of his new book.

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,770
<1-5,ALEXIS>我喜欢这章  尤其是
<1-5,ALEXIS>I loved it, especially the part

36
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,770
<1-5,ALEXIS>妮基和洛克在航母里那段
<1-5,ALEXIS>with Nikki and Rook in the aircraft carrier.

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:30,950
<1-5,ALEXIS>太赞了
<1-5,ALEXIS>Awesome.

38
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,530
<1-6,CASTLE>别说啦  人家会不好意思的
<1-6,CASTLE>Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

39
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,010
<1-7,ALEXIS>不过  我确实有个小意见
<1-7,ALEXIS>I do have one note, though.

40
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,030
<1-7,ALEXIS>那个新的角色  抢劫案探长
<1-7,ALEXIS>This new character, the, uh, robbery detective...

41
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,370
<1-8,CASTLE>斯莱明  这人如何
<1-8,CASTLE>Schlemming. What about him?

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,240
<1-9,ALEXIS>这人看起来好像凭空冒出来的
<1-9,ALEXIS>Well, he seems like he kinda came up out of nowhere.

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,800
<1-10,CASTLE>确实  这点我非常赞同
<1-10,CASTLE>Yeah, well, I can't argue with that.

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,770
<1-11,ALEXIS>-他被描写地好像一个蠢蛋  -你也觉得吧
<1-11,ALEXIS>- He's coming off a bit like a doofus. - You think?

45
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,180
<1-13,ALEXIS>我觉得你应该删了他
<1-13,ALEXIS>I think you should lose him.

46
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,430
<1-14,CASTLE>要真这么简单就好了
<1-14,CASTLE>If only it was this easy.

47
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,210
<1-14,CASTLE>谢谢你的帮助  宝贝儿
<1-14,CASTLE>Thank you for your help, sweetie.

48
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,540
<1-14,CASTLE>我的进度已经严重落后了
<1-14,CASTLE>I am so behind on my deadline.

49
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,920
<1-15,ALEXIS>那是因为你总是找各种花样拖延时间
<1-15,ALEXIS>That's 'cause you always find new ways to procrastinate.

50
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,270
<1-16,CASTLE>也可能是花样主动找我
<1-16,CASTLE>Or they find me.

51
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,140
<1-16,CASTLE>老妈  你好
<1-16,CASTLE>Hello, mother.

52
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,650
<1-17,MARTHA>孩子们好  我不能久留
<1-17,MARTHA>Oh, hi, guys. I can't stay.

53
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,880
<1-17,MARTHA>我只是来拿一条裙子
<1-17,MARTHA>I'm just picking up a dress.

54
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,200
<1-17,MARTHA>切特今晚要带我去剧院
<1-17,MARTHA>Chet's taking me to the theater this evening.

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,190
<1-18,ALEXIS>你们去看什么剧
<1-18,ALEXIS>Oh, what are you seeing?

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,350
<1-19,MARTHA>彼托夫斯基的新话剧《觉醒边缘》
<1-19,MARTHA>New Petrofsky play, "Edge Of Awakening."

57
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,730
<1-20,CASTLE>等一下  这部剧你不是还去试镜了吗
<1-20,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Didn't you audition for that?

58
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,020
<1-21,MARTHA>没错
<1-21,MARTHA>Uh-huh, yes.

59
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,480
<1-21,MARTHA>但那位出色的女演员玛吉·文思抢走了我的角色
<1-21,MARTHA>And that wonderful actress Madge Vance got my part,

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,810
<1-21,MARTHA>一如她之前所做的
<1-21,MARTHA>the way she usually does.

61
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,280
<1-22,CASTLE>她连你的朋友都算不上
<1-22,CASTLE>Well, she's not even really your friend.

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,270
<1-22,CASTLE>-你还去给她捧场  真好  -我知道
<1-22,CASTLE>- It's nice that you go and support her. - I know.

63
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,630
<1-23,MARTHA>而且我得赶紧去看  因为这剧快下线了
<1-23,MARTHA>And... I have to go soon, because it's closing.

64
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,260
<1-23,MARTHA>评论家对这剧的评价是"惨不忍睹"
<1-23,MARTHA>The critics are saying it's a... "train wreck."

65
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,480
<1-24,CASTLE>这才是我认识的玛莎·罗杰斯
<1-24,CASTLE>Oh, there's the martha rodgers I know.

66
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,530
<1-24,CASTLE>是贝克特
<1-24,CASTLE>Ah, Beckett.

67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,130
<1-24,CASTLE>请告诉我又有谋杀案了
<1-24,CASTLE>Please tell me there's been a murder,

68
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,610
<1-24,CASTLE>不然我还得继续埋头写作
<1-24,CASTLE>otherwise, I'll have to continue writing.

69
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,960
<2-1,CASTLE>人们总说他们希望在睡梦中死去
<2-1,CASTLE>People always say they want to die in their sleep.

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,190
<2-2,LANIE>是希望干脆利落地一枪了事
<2-2,LANIE>What you want is a good, clean shot to take you out

71
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,780
<2-2,LANIE>这样你才能死得痛快
<2-2,LANIE>before you know what hit you.

72
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,880
<2-2,LANIE>但这可怜的家伙
<2-2,LANIE>Not this poor guy.

73
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,070
<2-2,LANIE>子弹未击中心脏
<2-2,LANIE>Bullet missed the heart.

74
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,500
<2-2,LANIE>他过了很长一段时间才死掉
<2-2,LANIE>He didn't die for quite a while.

75
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,540
<2-3,CASTLE>看上去他正伸手
<2-3,CASTLE>Looks like he was reaching

76
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,870
<2-3,CASTLE>去拿电话向人求助
<2-3,CASTLE>for the phone to call for help.

77
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,850
<2-4,BECKETT>直到凶手用那东西砸向他的头
<2-4,BECKETT>Until our doer took that to his head.

78
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,530
<2-4,BECKETT>可能凶手是怕
<2-4,BECKETT>Probably didn't want to risk

79
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,050
<2-4,BECKETT>邻居们听到第二声枪响
<2-4,BECKETT>the neighbors hearing a second shot,

80
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,050
<2-4,BECKETT>于是他随手抓起最近的东西
<2-4,BECKETT>and so he grabbed the nearest thing

81
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,760
<2-4,BECKETT>把他了结了
<2-4,BECKETT>and finished him off.

82
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,620
<2-4,BECKETT>闹钟上也沾上了血迹
<2-4,BECKETT>There's blood spatter on the clock--

83
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,180
<2-4,BECKETT>一定是在
<2-4,BECKETT>must have been

84
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,950
<2-4,BECKETT>袭击时从床头柜上掉下来的
<2-4,BECKETT>knocked off the nightstand during the attack.

85
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,820
<2-5,CASTLE>十点三十四分  至少我们知道了
<2-5,CASTLE>10:34. At least we know what time

86
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,730
<2-5,CASTLE>案发的时间
<2-5,CASTLE>the festivities started.

87
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,980
<2-6,BECKETT>没有强行闯入的痕迹
<2-6,BECKETT>There's no signs of forced entry.

88
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,630
<2-6,BECKETT>他很可能是故意把窗户打开  以便呼吸新鲜空气
<2-6,BECKETT>He probably left this open so he could get a breath of fresh air.

89
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,490
<2-7,CASTLE>而且也没有安全监控录像
<2-7,CASTLE>And there's no security cameras either.

90
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,480
<2-7,CASTLE>我进来的时候也没看到有监控
<2-7,CASTLE>And I didn't see any on the way in.

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,790
<2-8,RYAN>清洁女工早上发现的尸体
<2-8,RYAN>Cleaning lady found him this morning.

92
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,790
<2-8,RYAN>她说  通常她来的时候
<2-8,RYAN>She said that usually, Wilder would've left for work

93
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,670
<2-8,RYAN>怀尔德已经上班去了
<2-8,RYAN>by the time she got here.

94
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,160
<2-9,CASTLE>怀尔德  戴米恩·怀尔德吗
<2-9,CASTLE>Wilder? Damian Wilder?

95
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,050
<2-10,ESPOSITO>没错  你认识他
<2-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you know him?

96
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,450
<2-10,ESPOSITO>久仰其名
<2-10,ESPOSITO>I know of him.

97
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,510
<2-11,CASTLE>这是他产品的一个广告宣传照片
<2-11,CASTLE>This is a photo from one of his ad campaigns.

98
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,240
<2-11,CASTLE>他开的精品店专卖男士护肤用品系列
<2-11,CASTLE>He--he runs a line of boutique men's skincare products.

99
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
<2-12,RYAN>你是说  浴室用品之类的
<2-12,RYAN>You mean, like, bathroom stuff?

100
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,740
<2-13,CASTLE>他有一种爽肤水  完全不含酒精
<2-13,CASTLE>He has got a toner, totally alcohol-free,

101
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,760
<2-13,CASTLE>太神奇了
<2-13,CASTLE>Fantastic.

102
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,480
<2-13,CASTLE>他还有一种很不可思议的剃须膏
<2-13,CASTLE>He's got a shaving cream that is ridiculous.

103
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,190
<2-14,ESPOSITO>药店卖的东西已经足够我用了  兄弟
<2-14,ESPOSITO>I'm good with the drug store stuff, man.

104
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,460
<2-15,CASTLE>不不不  等一下
<2-15,CASTLE>No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

105
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,590
<2-15,CASTLE>这玩意可以改变你的人生
<2-15,CASTLE>This stuff will change your life.

106
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,400
<2-16,ESPOSITO>-是热的  -热的
<2-16,ESPOSITO>- It's hot. - It's hot.

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,530
<2-16,ESPOSITO>-热的吗  -热的
<2-16,ESPOSITO>- It's hot? - It's hot.

108
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,390
<2-20,RYAN>-真是热的耶  -他们怎么做到的
<2-20,RYAN>- It's hot. - How do they do that?

109
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,880
<2-21,CASTLE>现代化学的神奇之处
<2-21,CASTLE>Magic of modern chemistry.

110
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,200
<2-21,CASTLE>这就好像在理发店刮胡子一样
<2-21,CASTLE>It's like getting a shave from a barber.

111
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,670
<2-21,CASTLE>实际上  这正是它的广告语  罐装理发师
<2-21,CASTLE>Matter of fact, that's the tagline--barber in a can.

112
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,020
<2-22,RYAN>那一定很贵吧
<2-22,RYAN>So it's probably expensive, huh?

113
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
<2-23,CASTLE>五十块一罐  但绝对物有所值
<2-23,CASTLE>It's 50 bucks a pop, but it's so worth it.

114
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,410
<2-24,ESPOSITO>-确实  -太值了
<2-24,ESPOSITO>- Absolutely. - Totally.

115
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,110
<2-26,BECKETT>兄弟们  别忘了这有个男人被杀了
<2-26,BECKETT>Guys... A man has been murdered here.

116
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,800
<2-27,CASTLE>我们就是在向他的遗产致敬呢
<2-27,CASTLE>And we are... honoring his legacy.

117
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,130
<2-28,LANIE>简直就和《欲望都市》一样
<2-28,LANIE>It's like "Sex And The City,"

118
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,710
<2-28,LANIE>只不过是男人版的
<2-28,LANIE>only with boys.

119
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,640
<2-29,BECKETT>也许你们可以找邻居们调查下
<2-29,BECKETT>Maybe you guys can check in with the neighbors,

120
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,710
<2-29,BECKETT>看他们有没有听到或者看到什么
<2-29,BECKETT>see if they saw or heard anything?

121
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,790
<2-30,RYAN>好的  现在就去
<2-30,RYAN>Oh, yeah. All over it.

122
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,900
<2-31,ESPOSITO>好  包我身上
<2-31,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'm on it.

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,610
<2-32,BECKETT>来吧  卡塞尔  看看我发现了什么
<2-32,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. Let me show you what I found.

124
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,280
<2-32,BECKETT>这柜子里有东西被偷走了
<2-32,BECKETT>Something was stolen from these cases.

125
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,740
<2-33,CASTLE>那是湿度控制器
<2-33,CASTLE>Those are humidity controls.

126
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,130
<2-34,BECKETT>不管被偷的是什么  肯定很值钱
<2-34,BECKETT>Well, whatever it was was very valuable,

127
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,420
<2-34,BECKETT>因为凶手连等离子电视
<2-34,BECKETT>because the killer passed up the plasma tv

128
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,930
<2-34,BECKETT>和蓝光碟机都没拿走
<2-34,BECKETT>and the blue-ray player.

129
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,030
<2-35,CASTLE>抢劫被发现了吗
<2-35,CASTLE>Robbery gone wrong?

130
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,550
<2-36,BECKETT>看上去像是  是吧
<2-36,BECKETT>Looks that way, doesn't it?

131
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,110
<2-36,BECKETT>还有这个
<2-36,BECKETT>And then there's this.

132
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,490
<2-37,CASTLE>那是E还是O啊
<2-37,CASTLE>Is that an "E" or an "O"?

133
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,720
<2-37,CASTLE>"Murdero"  西班牙语里的谋杀吗
<2-37,CASTLE>"Murdero," Is that spanish for murder?

134
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,890
<2-37,CASTLE>或者是"Murdere"  凶手是法国人
<2-37,CASTLE>"Murdere." The killer was French.

135
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,860
<2-38,BECKETT>我怎么都想不通的是
<2-38,BECKETT>The thing I don't get about it

136
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,820
<2-38,BECKETT>为什么一个小偷要花时间
<2-38,BECKETT>is why would a thief take the time

137
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,350
<2-38,BECKETT>用死者的血留下信息呢
<2-38,BECKETT>to write a message out of our vic's blood?

138
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,220
<2-39,CASTLE>尤其是这种信息
<2-39,CASTLE>Especially that message.

139
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,950
<2-39,CASTLE>我是说  我们当然知道是谋杀
<2-39,CASTLE>I mean, we know it's murder.

140
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,350
<2-39,CASTLE>从尸体上就可以看出来了
<2-39,CASTLE>The dead body's kind of a giveaway.

141
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,200
<2-40,RYAN>我们还在调查中
<2-40,RYAN>So we're still canvassing,

142
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,710
<2-40,RYAN>但我想你可能对这个消息感兴趣
<2-40,RYAN>but I thought you'd want to hear this--

143
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,240
<2-40,RYAN>一个邻居说
<2-40,RYAN>neighbor said

144
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,160
<2-40,RYAN>她昨晚正在跑步机上边跑边听音乐
<2-40,RYAN>she was on her treadmill last night listening to music.

145
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,480
<2-41,BECKETT>所以她没听到枪声
<2-41,BECKETT>So she didn't hear the shot.

146
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,930
<2-42,RYAN>没有  但她有把后门打开让猫进屋
<2-42,RYAN>No, but she did open her back door to let the cat in,

147
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,430
<2-42,RYAN>她看到有人从怀尔德的院子里出来
<2-42,RYAN>and she saw someone hopping over the fence

148
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,580
<2-42,RYAN>跳过院子里的栅栏
<2-42,RYAN>on their way out of Wilder's yard.

149
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,530
<2-43,CASTLE>看到那人长相没
<2-43,CASTLE>You get a description?

150
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,120
<2-44,RYAN>有  "一只脚在栅栏后消失不见了"
<2-44,RYAN>Yeah, "a foot disappearing over the fence."

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,210
<2-45,BECKETT>知道时间吗
<2-45,BECKETT>Did you get a time at all?

152
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,530
<2-46,RYAN>十点五十二分整
<2-46,RYAN>10:52 on the button.

153
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,960
<2-46,RYAN>她的报警器上还显示着呢
<2-46,RYAN>It was still on her alarm box.

154
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,450
<2-46,RYAN>她忘了在开门的时候关掉报警器
<2-46,RYAN>She forget she'd set it when she opened the door.

155
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,600
<2-47,CASTLE>那么我们现在知道
<2-47,CASTLE>So now we know what time

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,880
<2-47,CASTLE>凶杀结束于昨晚十点五十二分
<2-47,CASTLE>last night's festivities ended 10:52.

157
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,760
<2-48,BECKETT>好了  让鉴证小组搜集一下指纹和纤维
<2-48,BECKETT>All right, have CSU sweep for prints and fibers

158
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,970
<2-48,BECKETT>确保他们把后院也搜索一遍
<2-48,BECKETT>and make sure they hit the backyard as well.

159
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,920
<2-49,RYAN>好的
<2-49,RYAN>You got it.

160
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,080
<3-1,CASTLE>戴明
<3-1,CASTLE>Demming.

161
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,250
<3-2,DEMMING>卡塞尔
<3-2,DEMMING>Castle.

162
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,390
<3-3,CASTLE>你们劫案组也用白板吧
<3-3,CASTLE>You guys use, uh, boards down in robbery?

163
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,590
<3-4,DEMMING>当然了
<3-4,DEMMING>Sure, yeah.

164
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,450
<3-5,CASTLE>明天再来参观吧
<3-5,CASTLE>Well, come back tomorrow.

165
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,970
<3-5,CASTLE>到时候这上面会写满有关谋杀的内容
<3-5,CASTLE>It'll be full of all sorts of murder-y stuff.

166
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,220
<3-6,DEMMING>贝克特让我来协助调查  所以
<3-6,DEMMING>Beckett asked me to assist in the investigation, so...

167
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,040
<3-7,CASTLE>是吗
<3-7,CASTLE>Really?

168
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,010
<3-8,BECKETT>是啊  因为案件有抢劫的成分
<3-8,BECKETT>Yeah, because of the robbery component.

169
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,010
<3-9,CASTLE>当然
<3-9,CASTLE>Of course.

170
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,300
<3-10,BECKETT>我查了一下怀尔德的亲属
<3-10,BECKETT>I tracked down Wilder's next of kin,

171
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,240
<3-10,BECKETT>他有个表哥叫布雷克
<3-10,BECKETT>his cousin Blake.

172
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
<3-10,BECKETT>他正在接待室里
<3-10,BECKETT>He's in the interview lounge.

173
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,500
<4-1,BLAKE>你知道他是怎么进入这行的吗
<4-1,BLAKE>You know how he got in the business he did?

174
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,050
<4-1,BLAKE>青春痘
<4-1,BLAKE>Acne.

175
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,550
<4-1,BLAKE>他青少年时期青春痘很严重
<4-1,BLAKE>As a teenager, he had it something terrible.

176
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,630
<4-1,BLAKE>当他向我借钱
<4-1,BLAKE>When he asked me to

177
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,960
<4-1,BLAKE>准备自己做生意的时候
<4-1,BLAKE>lend him money to start up a business,

178
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,670
<4-1,BLAKE>我很乐意借给他  他...
<4-1,BLAKE>I was happy to do it. He...

179
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,470
<4-1,BLAKE>他是个很优秀的人
<4-1,BLAKE>He was one of the good ones.

180
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,350
<4-1,BLAKE>我是说
<4-1,BLAKE>I mean,

181
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,610
<4-1,BLAKE>为什么会有人能做出这种事情来  我...
<4-1,BLAKE>why somebody would do something like this, I...

182
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,850
<4-1,BLAKE>布雷克
<4-1,BLAKE>Blake,

183
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,740
<4-2,BECKETT>我们希望你能帮我们搞清楚一件事
<4-2,BECKETT>we were hoping that you could help us with something.

184
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,610
<4-2,BECKETT>客厅里有一个陈列柜子
<4-2,BECKETT>The display cases in the living room

185
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,670
<4-2,BECKETT>柜子被打破了  里面的东西不见了
<4-2,BECKETT>were broken into and their contents were missing.

186
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,460
<4-3,BLAKE>那是他藏书的地方
<4-3,BLAKE>Well, that's where he kept his books.

187
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
<4-3,BLAKE>他是个收藏家  收集精印本书籍
<4-3,BLAKE>He was a collector-- rare printings,

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,480
<4-3,BLAKE>或是签过名的头版书  诸如此类
<4-3,BLAKE>signed first editions, things like that.

189
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,710
<4-4,DEMMING>那些书可能值好几千
<4-4,DEMMING>Those could run into the thousands,

190
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,230
<4-4,DEMMING>甚至值好几万美元
<4-4,DEMMING>even tens of thousands.

191
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,410
<4-5,BLAKE>这么说是劫杀了
<4-5,BLAKE>So it was robbery?

192
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,000
<4-5,BLAKE>有人为了那些书而杀了他
<4-5,BLAKE>Somebody killed him to take his books?

193
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,610
<4-6,CASTLE>也可能另有动机
<4-6,CASTLE>Well, it's possible there's another motive.

194
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,260
<4-6,CASTLE>我们在墙上发现了留言
<4-6,CASTLE>We found a message written on the wall.

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,690
<4-7,BLAKE>这就怪了
<4-7,BLAKE>That's odd.

196
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,230
<4-8,BECKETT>那方面我们还在查  我们请您来是希望您
<4-8,BECKETT>We're still working on that. What we could really use

197
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,930
<4-8,BECKETT>帮忙提供失窃书籍的相关信息
<4-8,BECKETT>your help on is with the missing books.

198
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,830
<4-8,BECKETT>他的藏品有目录吗
<4-8,BECKETT>Did he have a catalog of his collection?

199
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,610
<4-9,BLAKE>当然  戴米恩指望我
<4-9,BLAKE>Sure. Damian looked to me

200
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,980
<4-9,BLAKE>在生意上帮他一把
<4-9,BLAKE>to help him out with the business side of things.

201
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,640
<4-9,BLAKE>他的承保人是我的一个朋友
<4-9,BLAKE>The insurer he used is a friend of mine.

202
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,380
<4-10,DEMMING>-他一定有目录  -据我们所知
<4-10,DEMMING>- He'll have a catalog.  - Well, as far as we know,

203
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,380
<4-10,DEMMING>丢失的只有书籍
<4-10,DEMMING>The only thing missing were the books, which suggests the

204
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,660
<4-10,DEMMING>也就是说  凶手的目标很明确
<4-10,DEMMING>perpetrator went there knowing what he was looking for.

205
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,110
<4-10,DEMMING>他可能有机会去公寓踩过点
<4-10,DEMMING>Could be he had an opportunity to case the apartment?

206
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,940
<4-11,BLAKE>这么说来  那厨房
<4-11,BLAKE>Well, the kitchen--

207
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,410
<4-11,BLAKE>我是说  戴米恩重新装修了厨房
<4-11,BLAKE>I mean, Damian had the entire thing renovated.

208
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,030
<4-11,BLAKE>好几周公寓里都是装修工人
<4-11,BLAKE>The place was crawling with workers for weeks.

209
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,680
<5-1,DEMMING>因价值连城的失窃书籍而被杀
<5-1,DEMMING>Killed for a fortune in stolen books.

210
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,690
<5-1,DEMMING>我去问问装修工人  看有没有线索
<5-1,DEMMING>So I'll run the work crews and see if anybody has priors.

211
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,690
<5-2,BECKETT>谢谢  汤姆  谢谢你来帮忙
<5-2,BECKETT>Thanks, Tom. I appreciate your help on this.

212
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,390
<5-3,DEMMING>有消息我会通知你的
<5-3,DEMMING>I'll let you know if anything turns up.

213
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,280
<5-4,CASTLE>真不明白为什么大家都妄下结论
<5-4,CASTLE>I'm not sure why everybody's jumping to the conclusion

214
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,050
<5-4,CASTLE>认为这起谋杀是因为那些失窃的书
<5-4,CASTLE>that this murder was about the stolen books.

215
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,700
<5-5,BECKETT>也许因为它们失窃了
<5-5,BECKETT>Maybe because they're missing.

216
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,670
<5-6,CASTLE>镜子上的留言透露了明显的杀意
<5-6,CASTLE>The message on the mirror suggests an intention to kill,

217
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,690
<5-6,CASTLE>算是某种动机了
<5-6,CASTLE>A motive of some kind.

218
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,330
<5-6,CASTLE>偷书  只是顺手牵羊罢了
<5-6,CASTLE>Stealing books-- just a crime of opportunity.

219
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,660
<5-7,BECKETT>现在是谁在妄下结论了
<5-7,BECKETT>And now who's jumping to conclusions?

220
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,080
<5-8,CASTLE>我只是不想看到有人浪费时间
<5-8,CASTLE>I just hate to see anybody waste their time.

221
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,820
<5-8,CASTLE>这条留言才是关键  不是书
<5-8,CASTLE>The key here is the message, not the books.

222
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,440
<5-9,BECKETT>我觉得两条线索都该调查
<5-9,BECKETT>I think we should pursue both lines of investigation.

223
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,610
<5-10,CASTLE>好吧  反正他是你男友
<5-10,CASTLE>Well, he's your boyfriend.

224
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,790
<5-11,BECKETT>你说什么
<5-11,BECKETT>Excuse me?

225
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,200
<5-12,CASTLE>抱歉  我又妄下结论了吗
<5-12,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Am I jumping to conclusions again?

226
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,210
<5-13,BECKETT>与你无关
<5-13,BECKETT>It's none of your business.

227
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,930
<5-14,ESPOSITO>我查了查怀尔德的背景
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Ran a background check on Wilder.

228
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,250
<5-14,ESPOSITO>发现了这份他三天前
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Found this incident report

229
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,050
<5-14,ESPOSITO>提交给警方的事故报告
<5-14,ESPOSITO>that he filed with the police three days ago.

230
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,570
<5-14,ESPOSITO>有人蓄意破坏了他的公寓
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Somebody vandalized his apartment.

231
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,410
<5-15,BECKETT>门廊泼满红色油漆
<5-15,BECKETT>Poured red paint all over his stoop.

232
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,300
<5-16,ESPOSITO>没错  原来他的公司被一群
<5-16,ESPOSITO>Yeah, it turns out that, uh, his company was being picketed

233
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,630
<5-16,ESPOSITO>动物权益保护者围攻了
<5-16,ESPOSITO>by animal rights protestors.

234
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,930
<5-17,CASTLE>可他的产品都标注着"不含动物实验"啊
<5-17,CASTLE>But all of his stuff is labeled "No Animal Testing."

235
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,300
<5-18,ESPOSITO>问题在于他的一个
<5-18,ESPOSITO>The problem was with, uh, one of his subcontractors,

236
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,120
<5-18,ESPOSITO>承制产品的转包商
<5-18,ESPOSITO>who was doing some of the manufacturing for him.

237
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,930
<5-18,ESPOSITO>怀尔德毫不知情
<5-18,ESPOSITO>Wilder didn't even know about it.

238
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,920
<5-19,CASTLE>这就能解释留言内容了
<5-19,CASTLE>That's what the message was.

239
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,350
<5-19,CASTLE>不是拼错了  而是没写完
<5-19,CASTLE>It wasn't misspelled. It was unfinished.

240
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,380
<5-19,CASTLE>-他们是要写"凶手"  -所以你
<5-19,CASTLE>- They were writing "Murderer." - So you think

241
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,400
<5-20,ESPOSITO>认为是某个动物权益保护者杀了他
<5-20,ESPOSITO>that one of the animal rights activists killed him.

242
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,470
<5-21,CASTLE>当然  他们中的某人用够了假血
<5-21,CASTLE>Sure. One of them had enough with the fake blood,

243
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,680
<5-21,CASTLE>于是决定  "我要用真血留下信息"
<5-21,CASTLE>decided, "I'm gonna send a message using the real thing."

244
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,600
<5-22,BECKETT>也许我们该去怀尔德的办公室
<5-22,BECKETT>Maybe we should pay Wilder's office a visit

245
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,990
<5-22,BECKETT>弄清抗议的来龙去脉
<5-22,BECKETT>and find out more about those protestors.

246
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,520
<6-1,LISA>我们本想找另一家承制商
<6-1,LISA>We were looking for another manufacturer

247
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,200
<6-1,LISA>代替原来的那家
<6-1,LISA>to replace the one we had been using.

248
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,070
<6-1,LISA>但显然
<6-1,LISA>But apparently,

249
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,350
<6-1,LISA>我们没那些抗议者动作快
<6-1,LISA>we weren't doing it fast enough for these protestors.

250
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,860
<6-2,DAPHNE>怀尔德先生想做正确的事
<6-2,DAPHNE>Mr. Wilder wanted to do the right thing.

251
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,700
<6-2,DAPHNE>真的  他只是还需要一点时间
<6-2,DAPHNE>He really did. He just needed a little more time.

252
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,280
<6-3,LISA>周四晚  戴米恩公寓的泼油漆事件
<6-3,LISA>The paint throwing incident at Damian's house

253
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,530
<6-3,LISA>促使他做了决定
<6-3,LISA>Thursday night was the last straw.

254
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,010
<6-3,LISA>他原计划今早召开新闻发布会
<6-3,LISA>He scheduled a press conference for this morning.

255
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,830
<6-3,LISA>他未曾透露此事  但他准备
<6-3,LISA>He hadn't told anybody, but he was planning to announce

256
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,530
<6-3,LISA>为动物权益保护活动捐一大笔钱
<6-3,LISA>a substantial donation to the animal rights movement

257
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,170
<6-3,LISA>以表明公司诚信可鉴
<6-3,LISA>as a sign of the company's good faith.

258
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,840
<6-3,LISA>他们得偿所愿了
<6-3,LISA>They got everything they wanted,

259
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,840
<6-3,LISA>但他们还是杀了他
<6-3,LISA>but they killed him anyway.

260
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,820
<6-4,BECKETT>说句公道话  詹金斯女士
<6-4,BECKETT>Well, to be fair, Ms. Jenkins,

261
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,070
<6-4,BECKETT>关于这点  我们还不能肯定
<6-4,BECKETT>we don't know that definitively.

262
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,350
<6-5,CASTLE>周四的事故  是怀尔德先生第一次
<6-5,CASTLE>The incident on Thursday, was that the first time

263
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,430
<6-5,CASTLE>遭受人身攻击吗
<6-5,CASTLE>that Mr. Wilder had been targeted personally?

264
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,450
<6-6,DAPHNE>他们通常只是在大楼外滋事
<6-6,DAPHNE>Usually, they just picket outside the building.

265
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,030
<6-7,LISA>事态变得非常糟糕
<6-7,LISA>It got so bad,

266
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,730
<6-7,LISA>有一阵子  我们还动用了私人保安公司
<6-7,LISA>we actually hired a private security firm for a while

267
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,360
<6-7,LISA>以妨恐吓邮件内容成真
<6-7,LISA>to run down some of the threats we got in the mail.

268
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,790
<6-8,CASTLE>我们能看看他们发来的信息吗
<6-8,CASTLE>Is there a chance we could take a look

269
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,330
<6-8,CASTLE>可能会有帮助
<6-8,CASTLE>at the information they developed? It could be helpful.

270
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,750
<6-9,LISA>当然
<6-9,LISA>Of course. Yeah.

271
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,170
<6-9,LISA>达芙妮会汇总好交给你们的
<6-9,LISA>Daphne will put it together for you.

272
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,960
<6-10,BECKETT>我们还需要一份怀尔德先生
<6-10,BECKETT>We'll also need to see a copy of Mr. Wilder's date book

273
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,000
<6-10,BECKETT>近几周的日程安排
<6-10,BECKETT>for the last couple of weeks.

274
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,550
<6-11,LISA>没问题  要什么都行
<6-11,LISA>Absolutely. Anything you need.

275
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,000
<6-12,WOMAN>给你  先生
<6-12,WOMAN>Here you go, sir.

276
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,030
<6-13,BECKETT>真不敢相信你居然要了试用品
<6-13,BECKETT>I cannot believe that you asked for samples.

277
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,460
<6-14,CASTLE>她说我们要啥都行的
<6-14,CASTLE>She said anything we needed.

278
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,360
<6-14,CASTLE>而且这不是给我自己的
<6-14,CASTLE>Besides, it's not for me.

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,560
<6-14,CASTLE>是给莱恩和埃斯波西托的
<6-14,CASTLE>It's for Ryan and Esposito.

280
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,140
<6-15,BECKETT>你是指夏洛特和米兰达吧
<6-15,BECKETT>Don't you mean Charlotte and Miranda?

281
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,040
<6-16,CASTLE>等等  那我成了凯莉了
<6-16,CASTLE>Wait a minute. That would make me Carrie.

282
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,230
<6-17,BECKETT>你还真是都市型男啊  居然知道《欲望都市》
<6-17,BECKETT>You're so metrosexual for even knowing that.

283
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,190
<6-18,CASTLE>我只是在我妈看这剧的时候
<6-18,CASTLE>I only watched that show out of the corner of my eye

284
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,030
<6-18,CASTLE>稍微瞄了几眼
<6-18,CASTLE>when my mother had it on.

285
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,910
<6-18,CASTLE>真是越描越黑
<6-18,CASTLE>That so did not come out right.

286
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,300
<7-1,CASTLE>根据私人保安公司的记录
<7-1,CASTLE>According to these notes from the private security firm,

287
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,470
<7-1,CASTLE>这些人大多数很普通  都是些
<7-1,CASTLE>most of these folks seem like average, everyday,

288
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,880
<7-1,CASTLE>爱护环境的素食主义者
<7-1,CASTLE>tree-hugging vegetarians.

289
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,840
<7-1,CASTLE>目前为止  他们做过最糟的事
<7-1,CASTLE>I mean, so far, the worst any of them has done

290
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,950
<7-1,CASTLE>就是闯进一家实验室放跑了一堆老鼠
<7-1,CASTLE>is break into a lab to free a bunch of mice.

291
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,150
<7-1,CASTLE>你那边有什么发现吗
<7-1,CASTLE>You come up with anything?

292
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,630
<7-2,BECKETT>怀尔德的日程表里
<7-2,BECKETT>There are a handful of recent entries

293
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,400
<7-2,BECKETT>有好几条是要见一个叫娜塔莎的人
<7-2,BECKETT>in Wilder's calendar for someone named Natasha.

294
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,360
<7-2,BECKETT>可能是他刚交上的女友
<7-2,BECKETT>Could be someone that he started dating?

295
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,530
<7-4,BECKETT>我查了装修过被害人厨房的工人
<7-4,BECKETT>So I ran the workmen who renovated your vic's kitchen.

296
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,680
<7-5,DEMMING>有一个人值得注意
<7-5,DEMMING>And one of 'em popped.

297
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,670
<7-5,DEMMING>他叫杰克·凯布里斯
<7-5,DEMMING>Meet Jake Cabrese.

298
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,520
<7-5,DEMMING>他去年工作过的两所公寓
<7-5,DEMMING>Two of the apartments

299
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,890
<7-5,DEMMING>随后都遭到了抢劫
<7-5,DEMMING>he worked on in the past year were later robbed.

300
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,300
<7-5,DEMMING>两件案子他都有嫌疑
<7-5,DEMMING>He was a person of interest in both investigations,

301
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,330
<7-5,DEMMING>但最终罪名都没成立
<7-5,DEMMING>but neither of them made.

302
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,840
<7-6,BECKETT>看来我们得找他谈谈
<7-6,BECKETT>Sounds like someone we should talk to.

303
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,050
<7-7,DEMMING>我们说话这会儿  已经有警员在查他的下落了
<7-7,DEMMING>Well, we're running down his whereabouts as we speak.

304
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,510
<7-8,CASTLE>啊哈  看看这个兰斯·纽曼
<7-8,CASTLE>Aha! Meet Lance Newman--

305
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,690
<7-8,CASTLE>因暴力滋事被捕过五次
<7-8,CASTLE>Arrested five times for violent agitation.

306
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,010
<7-8,CASTLE>他最爱的抗议工具是...假血
<7-8,CASTLE>His favorite tool of protest-- the bucket of fake blood.

307
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,550
<7-9,DEMMING>这种抗议活动不都爱用假血吗
<7-9,DEMMING>Isn't fake blood kind of a staple with these types?

308
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,050
<7-10,CASTLE>上个月
<7-10,CASTLE>Last month,

309
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,210
<7-10,CASTLE>他在一名国会议员的车上喷上了"凶手"
<7-10,CASTLE>he painted the word "Murderer" on a congressman's

310
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,740
<7-10,CASTLE>因为对方投票反对禁渔期
<7-10,CASTLE>car because he voted against a fishing ban.

311
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,460
<7-10,CASTLE>当司机试图阻止时  他用油漆桶
<7-10,CASTLE>When the driver tried to stop him, Newman bashed him

312
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,880
<7-10,CASTLE>重重击打了对方的头部
<7-10,CASTLE>in the side of the head with his paint bucket.

313
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,910
<7-11,BECKETT>要是能找到线索  把他和受害人联系起来
<7-11,BECKETT>You know, I'd like him more if we could find something

314
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,330
<7-11,BECKETT>我会觉得他嫌疑更大
<7-11,BECKETT>that would connect him with our vic.

315
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,380
<7-12,CASTLE>你是说  写给怀尔德的一堆恐吓信吗
<7-12,CASTLE>You mean like the string of violent letters he wrote

316
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,740
<7-12,CASTLE>直接寄到他家的
<7-12,CASTLE>to Wilder... sent to his home address?

317
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,340
<7-13,BECKETT>干得好  卡塞尔  咱们去抓他吧
<7-13,BECKETT>Nice job, Castle. Let's go pick him up.

<8-2,CASTLE>Three days later, he ends up dead.

323
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,460
<8-2,CASTLE>稍有头脑的人  都会把这两件事联系起来
<8-2,CASTLE>It does not take a genius to make the connection.

324
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,930
<8-3,LANCE>没错  可我没杀他

<10-6,MARTHA>她是从我手上把那个角色偷走的
<10-6,MARTHA>yeah, she kinda snaked that part out from under me.

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,990
<10-6,MARTHA>但是我却不得不承认
<10-6,MARTHA>But then I... I hate to admit it.

395
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,260
<10-6,MARTHA>她得到那个角色当之无愧
<10-6,MARTHA>She deserved to get it.

<10-8,MARTHA>In life, you just have to accept the fact

400
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,820
<10-8,MARTHA>顺你心意这个事实
<10-8,MARTHA>that not everything is gonna go your way.

406
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,260

<12-13,BECKETT>我在想一个像怀尔德这样的有钱人  为什么

466
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,570
<12-13,BECKETT>会选择新泽西的便宜旅馆和人幽会
<12-13,BECKETT>would choose a cheap motel in Jersey to have a tryst.

467
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,960
<12-14,CASTLE>也许不单单是幽会
<12-14,CASTLE>Maybe there's more going on than just a tryst.

<14-1,BECKETT>匆忙离开了
<14-1,BECKETT>packed a bag and left in a hurry.

485
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,730
<14-2,CASTLE>时机看起来是不是有点可疑呢
<14-2,CASTLE>Is it just me, or is the timing a little suspicious?

<14-3,BECKETT>我在系统里发一份他的通缉令

<14-4,CASTLE>很难想象他有时间去见她
<14-4,CASTLE>It's hard to figure him getting back out there to see her.

492
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,710
<14-5,BECKETT>那她为什么租那么长时间
<14-5,BECKETT>So why did she rent it for that long?

493

<19-11,CASTLE>他们应该去找那个流浪汉
<19-11,CASTLE>They're supposed to be finding that homeless guy.

548
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,400
<19-11,CASTLE>但他们互送秋波
<19-11,CASTLE>I don't know how they're gonna do that

549
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,640
<19-11,CASTLE>还怎么工作呢
<19-11,CASTLE>when all they can do is make goo-goo eyes at each other.

550
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,920
<19-12,RYAN>贝克特是个好警察
<19-12,RYAN>Beckett's a good cop.

551
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,500
<19-12,RYAN>她可以一边查案一边暗送秋波
<19-12,RYAN>She can canvass and make goo-goo eyes at the same time.

552
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,410
<19-13,CASTLE>也许我们应该致电旅馆  看看本尼是否现身
<19-13,CASTLE>Maybe we should call the motel, see if Benny's turned up.

553
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,700
<19-14,RYAN>我十分钟前刚打过  另外有可能是
<19-14,RYAN>I just called ten minutes ago. Besides, chances are,

554
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,940
<19-14,RYAN>戴明抓的那书贩子干的
<19-14,RYAN>this book guy that Demming's got in the lockup did it.

555
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,840
<19-15,CASTLE>别这样说
<19-15,CASTLE>Oh, don't say that.

556
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
<19-15,CASTLE>什么
<19-15,CASTLE>What? Oh.

557
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,510
<19-16,RYAN>你想成为破案的功臣  而不是戴明
<19-16,RYAN>You want to be the one to crack it, not Demming, right?

558
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,170
<19-17,CASTLE>那家伙甚至不是凶案组的
<19-17,CASTLE>Well, the guy is not even homicide.

559
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,800
<19-17,CASTLE>这难道不让你有点恼火吗
<19-17,CASTLE>Doesn't that bug you just a little?

560
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,840
<19-18,RYAN>也许有点
<19-18,RYAN>Maybe a little.

561
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,720
<19-18,RYAN>但那不是你恼火的原因
<19-18,RYAN>But that's not why it bugs you, is it?

562
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,270
<19-19,ESPOSITO>刚从电讯公司得到的消息
<19-19,ESPOSITO>Just heard back from the phone company.

563
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,150
<19-19,ESPOSITO>斯嘉丽·奥哈拉入住那家旅馆房间的四天里
<19-19,ESPOSITO>Only one call came into the motel room

564
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,800
<19-19,ESPOSITO>只有一个电话打进去
<19-19,ESPOSITO>during the four days that it was rented to Scarlett O'Hara.

565
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,540
<19-20,RYAN>让我猜猜  白瑞德[《乱世佳人》男主角]  是吗
<19-20,RYAN>Ooh, let me guess. Rhett Butler, right?

566
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,730
<19-20,RYAN>白瑞德  了解笑点了吗
<19-20,RYAN>Rhett butler? See what I did there?

567
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,850
<19-21,ESPOSITO>通话时长两分钟  就在怀尔德旧情人说
<19-21,ESPOSITO>Call lasted two minutes. Came in around the same time

568
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,450
<19-21,ESPOSITO>他进房的那个时间打的
<19-21,ESPOSITO>that Wilder's ex said he went up to the room.

569
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,140
<19-22,CASTLE>唯一知道怀尔德在那里的人
<19-22,CASTLE>Well, the only one who would've known Wilder was there

570
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,490
<19-22,CASTLE>肯定是和他幽会的那个女人
<19-22,CASTLE>would've been the woman planning to meet him.

571
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,870
<19-23,RYAN>也许她打来说她迟到了
<19-23,RYAN>Maybe she called to say she was running late.

572
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,130
<19-24,ESPOSITO>是啊  接下来才是重点
<19-24,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, here's the money part...

573
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,000
<19-24,ESPOSITO>这电话来自怀尔德的公司
<19-24,ESPOSITO>The call came from Wilder's company.

574
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,900
<19-25,CASTLE>他和公司同事有染
<19-25,CASTLE>He was having an affair with someone from work.

575
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,090
<19-26,ESPOSITO>是的  但很不幸  他们追查到的电话
<19-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but unfortunately, the way that they route the calls,

576
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,310
<19-26,ESPOSITO>我们只能把范围缩小到
<19-26,ESPOSITO>we were only able to narrow it down to an extension

577
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,400
<19-26,ESPOSITO>公司三楼的一个分机
<19-26,ESPOSITO>on the third floor of his building.

578
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,630
<19-27,RYAN>我们可以排除男士
<19-27,RYAN>Well, and we can rule out all the men,

579
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,680
<19-27,RYAN>因为我们知道斯嘉丽是个女的
<19-27,RYAN>since we know Scarlett was a woman.

580
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,000
<19-28,ESPOSITO>没错  最有可能的是
<19-28,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and most likely, it was the woman

581
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,720
<19-28,ESPOSITO>这女人是和怀尔德在公寓里吵架的那个
<19-28,ESPOSITO>that Wilder was fighting with at his apartment.

582
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,930
<19-29,CASTLE>肯定有方法可以找出她是谁
<19-29,CASTLE>There's gotta be a way we can figure out who it was.

583
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,750
<19-30,ESPOSITO>我们可以进行声音辨认
<19-30,ESPOSITO>We could do a sound lineup.

584
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,040
<19-32,CASTLE>声音辨认
<19-32,CASTLE>Sound lineup?

585
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,120
<19-33,RYAN>我们叫偷听吵架的那家伙
<19-33,RYAN>Yeah, we bring in the guy who overheard the argument,

586
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,520
<19-33,RYAN>听听三楼所有女士的声音样本
<19-33,RYAN>have him listen to voice samples from all the women

587
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,950
<19-33,RYAN>看看他能不能认出那个声音
<19-33,RYAN>on the third floor, see if he recognizes any of 'em.

588
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,820
<19-34,CASTLE>可以吗
<19-34,CASTLE>You can do that?

589
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,680
<19-35,RYAN>我们甚至不需要叫那些女士来
<19-35,RYAN>We don't even need to bring any of the women in.

590
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,750
<19-35,RYAN>可以进入语音留言系统
<19-35,RYAN>We can patch into the voice mail system,

591
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,430
<19-35,RYAN>提取样本
<19-35,RYAN>pull samples from there.

592
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,370
<19-36,CASTLE>伙计们  如果成功的话
<19-36,CASTLE>You guys, if this works,

593
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,750
<19-36,CASTLE>-你们俩一年的剃须膏我包了  -成交
<19-36,CASTLE>- I'll keep you both in shave cream for a year.  - Deal.

594
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,010
<19-38,RYAN>你们找到他了
<19-38,RYAN>You found him?

595
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,720
<19-39,CASTLE>坐下
<19-39,CASTLE>Take a seat.

596
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,780
<19-41,BECKETT>是的  运气不错  显然马蒂是个瘾君子
<19-41,BECKETT>Yeah, we got lucky. Apparently, Marty the junkie here,

597
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,710
<19-41,BECKETT>公园的那个地区是他的据点
<19-41,BECKETT>is a permanent fixture in that part of the park.

598
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,690
<19-41,BECKETT>他就在卢卡斯买书
<19-41,BECKETT>He was panhandling right about

599
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,600
<19-41,BECKETT>那地方行乞
<19-41,BECKETT>where Lukas said he bought the books.

600
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,450
<19-42,DEMMING>而且马蒂承认以一百美金
<19-42,DEMMING>Which Marty's already admitted to

601
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,240
<19-42,DEMMING>把书卖给了他
<19-42,DEMMING>selling to him for 100 bucks.

602
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,640
<19-43,CASTLE>那他承认入室抢劫怀尔德的公寓了吗
<19-43,CASTLE>Has he admitted to breaking into Wilder's apartment?

603
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,130
<19-44,DEMMING>接下来就很有趣了
<19-44,DEMMING>Well, that's where things get interesting.

604
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,210
<19-44,DEMMING>他入室抢劫的不在场证明成立
<19-44,DEMMING>His alibi for the break-in is solid.

605
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,130
<19-44,DEMMING>他在一家救助站做了几小时清洁工
<19-44,DEMMING>He picked up a few extra bucks at a soup kitchen,

606
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,150
<19-44,DEMMING>赚点外快
<19-44,DEMMING>cleaning up after hours.

607
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
<19-45,BECKETT>他说是在垃圾桶捡到的那些书
<19-45,BECKETT>Claims he found the books in a garbage can.

608
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,500
<19-45,BECKETT>还说看见是有人扔在那里的
<19-45,BECKETT>Says he saw somebody dumping them there

609
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,940
<19-45,BECKETT>就在凶案发生的几小时后
<19-45,BECKETT>a couple hours after our murder.

610
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,600
<19-46,DEMMING>那人肯定就是凶手
<19-46,DEMMING>Which, pretty good bet, that is our killer.

611
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,380
<19-46,DEMMING>我要带他去做凶手人像素描
<19-46,DEMMING>I'm gonna sit him down with a sketch artist now.

612
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,210
<19-46,DEMMING>走吧  马蒂
<19-46,DEMMING>Come on, Marty.

613
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,440
<19-47,BECKETT>神秘女人那里有线索吗
<19-47,BECKETT>Any leads on our mystery woman?

614
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,490
<19-48,CASTLE>事实上有
<19-48,CASTLE>Actually, yes.

641
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,520

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,210
<21-1,BECKETT>还有一个证人说
<21-1,BECKETT>and another one says

648
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,170
<21-1,BECKETT>看到怀尔德的表哥扔书
<21-1,BECKETT>that he saw Wilder's cousin dumping his books.

649
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,240
<21-1,BECKETT>但我们没查到两位嫌疑人的杀人动机
<21-1,BECKETT>But what we don't have from either suspect is motive.

650
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,580
<21-2,CASTLE>简单  丽莎和怀尔德奸情出现了问题
<21-2,CASTLE>Easy. Lisa's affair with Wilder went south.

651
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,760
<21-2,CASTLE>他们不可能再一起共事
<21-2,CASTLE>They could no longer work together side by side,

652
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,180
<21-2,CASTLE>但她却不想被迫辞去工作
<21-2,CASTLE>and she didn't want to have to quit her job.

653
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,900
<21-3,DEMMING>-戴明探长  -什么都有可能
<21-3,DEMMING>- Detective Demming?  - Oh, it could be anything.

654
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,690
<21-3,DEMMING>我不知道  也许布雷克不愿意看到
<21-3,DEMMING>I don't know. Maybe Blake didn't like the fact

655
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,780
<21-3,DEMMING>怀尔德比他更成功的事实
<21-3,DEMMING>that wilder grew up to be more successful than him.

656
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,140
<21-3,DEMMING>也许他已经厌倦了高尔夫总也打不赢
<21-3,DEMMING>Maybe he was sick of getting beat at golf.

657
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,420
<21-4,CASTLE>-高尔夫  真的吗  -老实说
<21-4,CASTLE>- Golf, really?  - To be honest with you,

658
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,640
<21-5,DEMMING>我现在不关心动机这事
<21-5,DEMMING>I'm not that concerned about a motive right now.

659
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,020
<21-5,DEMMING>我有目击证人在案发当晚看到
<21-5,DEMMING>I've got an eyewitness that saw him tossing his cousin's

660
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,830
<21-5,DEMMING>他在扔他表弟价值不菲的书籍收藏
<21-5,DEMMING>prize book collection the night of the murder.

661
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,690
<21-6,CASTLE>我也有证人
<21-6,CASTLE>I have a witness,too.

662
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,280
<21-7,DEMMING>听到怀尔德三天前和某人吵架
<21-7,DEMMING>That heard Wilder fight with someone three days ago.

663
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,340
<21-7,DEMMING>-这毫无意义  -伙计们
<21-7,DEMMING>- It doesn't mean anything.  - Guys--

664
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,370
<21-9,CASTLE>至少有杀人动机
<21-9,CASTLE>At least I have a motive.

665
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,750
<21-10,DEMMING>是的  但不足以证明嫌疑人在案发现场
<21-10,DEMMING>Yeah, but can't put your suspect at the scene.

666
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,980
<21-9,CASTLE>-伙计们  -你有说过找到杀人动机吗
<21-9,CASTLE>- Guys--  - Did I miss the part where you had a motive?

667
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,190
<21-9,CASTLE>你不需要杀人动机
<21-9,CASTLE>You don't need a motive.

668
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,000
<21-11,BECKETT>伙计们  这不是比赛
<21-11,BECKETT>Guys. This isn't a competition.

669
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,490
<21-12,BECKETT>我们找到两个嫌疑很大的嫌犯
<21-12,BECKETT>We've got two good suspects.

670
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,930
<21-12,BECKETT>我觉得应该把他们都带来问话
<21-12,BECKETT>Seems to me that we should bring them in

671
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,420
<21-12,BECKETT>听听他们的说辞
<21-12,BECKETT>and see what they say.

672
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,830
<22-1,LISA>好吧  好吧
<22-1,LISA>Okay, fine.

673
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,430
<22-1,LISA>戴米恩和我周四晚上
<22-1,LISA>Damian and I had an argument

674
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,760
<22-1,LISA>在他的公寓里吵了一架
<22-1,LISA>at his apartment on Thursday night.

675
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,880
<22-1,LISA>但我和他没偷情
<22-1,LISA>But I was not having an affair with him,

676
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,670
<22-1,LISA>我从未去过新泽西的旅馆和他幽会
<22-1,LISA>and I never went to New Jersey to meet him in any motel.

677
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,140
<22-2,BECKETT>我们的证人说他听到扔东西的声音
<22-2,BECKETT>Our witness said that he heard things being thrown,

678
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,760
<22-2,BECKETT>还听到怀尔德说
<22-2,BECKETT>and that Wilder said something

679
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,100
<22-2,BECKETT>有枪指着他的头
<22-2,BECKETT>about having a gun to his head.

680
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,270
<22-3,LISA>不不不  他在说那些抗议者
<22-3,LISA>No, no. He was talking about the protestors.

681
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,560
<22-3,LISA>戴米恩因为我们找新承制商
<22-3,LISA>You see, Damian was unhappy because it was taking

682
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,280
<22-3,LISA>花费了很长时间而不高兴
<22-3,LISA>so long for us to find a new manufacturer.

683
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,360
<22-3,LISA>作为生产总监  他觉得错在我
<22-3,LISA>And as head of production, he felt that was on me.

684
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,860
<22-3,LISA>我觉得这不公平
<22-3,LISA>I didn't think it was fair,

685
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,170
<22-3,LISA>事情有点过火
<22-3,LISA>and... things got a little heated.

686
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,690
<22-4,BECKETT>能告诉我们你周日晚上在哪里吗
<22-4,BECKETT>Could you tell us where you were sunday night?

687
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,190
<22-5,LISA>我和一些朋友外出吃饭
<22-5,LISA>I was out for dinner with some friends.

688
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,230
<22-7,LISA>-晚餐后呢  -你能具体点吗
<22-7,LISA>- After dinner?  - Can you be a little more specific?

689
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,790
<22-8,BECKETT>好的  我可以更为具体
<22-8,BECKETT>Yeah, I can be a lot more specific.

690
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,360
<22-8,BECKETT>在10:34至10:52这段时间
<22-8,BECKETT>Uh, let's say between 10:34 and 10:52.

691
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,090
<22-8,BECKETT>我在家  独自一人
<22-8,BECKETT>I was home... alone.

692
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,350
<22-9,LISA>不过我出去了一会儿
<22-9,LISA>Though I did step out at some point.

693
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,360
<22-9,LISA>我住所附近路边停车是交替的
<22-9,LISA>My neighborhood has alternate side of the street parking,

694
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,840
<22-9,LISA>我必须开走我的车  再找停车位
<22-9,LISA>and I had to move my car, find a different space.

695
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,430
<22-10,CASTLE>有人看见你吗
<22-10,CASTLE>Did anyone see you?

696
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,630
<22-11,LISA>-这个我不知道  -那是几点
<22-11,LISA>- Not that I know of.  - And what time was that?

697
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,500
<22-13,LISA>也许是10:15
<22-13,LISA>10:15 maybe?

698
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,110
<22-14,CASLTE>你的住所离怀尔德
<22-14,CASLTE>You live, what,

699
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,860
<22-14,CASLTE>居住的莱克斯街有十个街区
<22-14,CASLTE>ten blocks down Lex from where Wilder lived?

700
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,230
<22-14,CASLTE>在那个时间  开车两分钟就可以到
<22-14,CASLTE>At that hour, that drive would take you two minutes.

701
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
<22-15,LISA>我想是
<22-15,LISA>I suppose.

702
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,480
<22-15,LISA>我从未算过时间
<22-15,LISA>I've never really timed it.

703
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,840
<23-1,CASTLE>当你问她周日晚上在哪的时候
<23-1,CASTLE>Did you see how squirrelly she got

704
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,360
<23-1,CASTLE>她表情很奇怪  你发现了吧
<23-1,CASTLE>when you asked her where she was Sunday night?

705
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,090
<23-2,BECKETT>我会叫埃斯波西托去盘问她的门卫
<23-2,BECKETT>I'll have Esposito talk to her doorman.

706
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,170
<23-2,BECKETT>也许有监控录像可以查出
<23-2,BECKETT>There might be security cam footage that might nail down

707
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,500
<23-2,BECKETT>她离开公寓多久
<23-2,BECKETT>how long she was gone from her apartment.

708
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,990
<23-3,CASTLE>我可以旁听吗
<23-3,CASTLE>Can I sit in?

709
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,610
<23-3,CASTLE>想得美
<23-3,CASTLE>Yeah, right.

710
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,060
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>真不敢相信仅凭流浪汉的片言只语
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>I can't believe that you guys are dragging me down here

711
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,360
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>你们就把我拽来审问
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>on the word of some bum,

712
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,850
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>还控告我谋杀我表弟
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>and then accusing me of murdering my own cousin.

713
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,800
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>相信我
<24-1,BLAKE WILDER>Well, believe me.

714
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,710
<24-2,DEMMING>我们也想排除你的嫌疑
<24-2,DEMMING>We'd like nothing more than to be able to rule you out.

715
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,480
<24-2,DEMMING>容我复述一次  周日晚上你和朋友
<24-2,DEMMING>So tell me again. You said you were meeting some friends

716
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,970
<24-2,DEMMING>相约喝酒  对吧
<24-2,DEMMING>for a drink sunday night?

717
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,460
<24-3,BLAKE>没错  在麦克杜根酒吧  十一点过后
<24-3,BLAKE>Yeah, a-at Mcdugan's, after 11:00.

718
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,850
<24-4,BECKETT>-离你表弟那相距一个街区  -对
<24-4,BECKETT>- That's about a block away from your cousin's place. - Yeah.

719
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,120
<24-5,BLAKE>你还说会见朋友之前你一直
<24-5,BLAKE>And you say you were at home until you went out

720
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,410
<24-6,DEMMING>-待在家里  -是的
<24-6,DEMMING>- to meet your friends? - Yes.

721
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,660
<24-8,DEMMING>你确定吗
<24-8,DEMMING>Are you sure about that?

722
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,860
<24-8,DEMMING>因为我会查问你的门卫
<24-8,DEMMING>Because I'm gonna talk to your doorman.

723
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,900
<24-9,BLAKE>-我那没有门卫  -那就问你的邻居
<24-9,BLAKE>- I-I don't have one. - Well, I'm gonna talk to your neighbors.

724
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,620
<24-10,DEMMING>我会核查你的消费记录
<24-10,DEMMING>I'm gonna check your credit card receipts.

725
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,120
<24-10,DEMMING>如果你说谎了
<24-10,DEMMING>If you weren't home when you say you were,

726
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,740
<24-10,DEMMING>我会查出来的
<24-10,DEMMING>I am gonna find out about it.

727
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,000
<24-11,BLAKE>好了  我说  我并没有直奔酒吧
<24-11,BLAKE>All right, all right, fine. I didn't go straight to the bar.

728
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,030
<24-11,BLAKE>我先去报摊  买了几根烟  行了吧
<24-11,BLAKE>I went to a newsstand. I bought some cigarettes, all right?

729
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,440
<24-11,BLAKE>我的朋友以为我戒掉了
<24-11,BLAKE>My friends think that I quit,

730
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,330
<24-11,BLAKE>但有时还是难忍烟瘾发作
<24-11,BLAKE>but every once in a while, I get a craving that I can't put off.

731
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,150
<24-11,BLAKE>所以我去了自动柜员机  取了点现金
<24-11,BLAKE>So I went to the ATM, I got some cash.

732
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,110
<24-11,BLAKE>买了包烟  抽了几根  把剩余的扔掉
<24-11,BLAKE>I bought a pack, smoked a few, threw the rest away.

733
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,940
<24-12,BECKETT>那时是几点
<24-12,BECKETT>What time was that?

734
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,280
<24-14,DEMMING>-忘记了  -自动柜员机会有记录
<24-14,DEMMING>- I don't remember. - Well, your ATM will.

735
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,000
<24-15,BECKETT>你可以坐一会
<24-15,BECKETT>You can take a seat.

736
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,150
<24-16,DEMMING>失陪一下
<24-16,DEMMING>Excuse us.

737
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,950
<25-1,DEMMING>对  附近有一个报摊
<25-1,DEMMING>Yeah, at a newsstand,

738
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,750
<25-1,DEMMING>在莱克斯街和32号大街转角位置
<25-1,DEMMING>corner of 32nd and Lex?

739
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,280
<25-1,DEMMING>行  去吧  我等着
<25-1,DEMMING>Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I'll hold.

740
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,760
<26-1,CASTLE>她出现了  正在出门
<26-1,CASTLE>Ah, there she is, leaving her building.

741
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,110
<26-2,ESPOSITO>时间为晚上10:18
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Well, the time stamp says 10:18.

742
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,580
<26-3,CASTLE>那她有足够时间赶在10:34之前
<26-3,CASTLE>Which would give her plenty of time to jump in her car

743
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,740
<26-3,CASTLE>开车去到怀尔德那
<26-3,CASTLE>and get down to Wilder's place by 10:34.

744
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:54,170
<26-4,BECKETT>我们已知凶手在10:52离开犯罪现场
<26-4,BECKETT>Well, we know that the killer left the crime scene at 10:52.

745
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,240
<26-4,BECKETT>所以问题是  她什么时候回到家
<26-4,BECKETT>So the question is, when did she get back?

746
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,560
<26-5,DEMMING>好的  知道  谢谢
<26-5,DEMMING>Yeah, got it. Thanks.

747
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,600
<26-5,DEMMING>银行确认了布雷克曾在自动柜员机取款
<26-5,DEMMING>So the bank confirmed Blake's ATM withdrawal.

748
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,370
<26-6,BECKETT>时间呢
<26-6,BECKETT>And?

749
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,180
<26-7,DEMMING>晚上10:39
<26-7,DEMMING>10:39 pm.

750
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,480
<26-7,DEMMING>正好在行凶时间区之内
<26-7,DEMMING>Right smack in the middle of our timeline.

751
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,700
<26-8,BECKETT>所以凶手并不是他
<26-8,BECKETT>So that means it wasn't him.

752
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,930
<26-10,ESPOSITO>她回来了  我倒回一点
<26-10,ESPOSITO>Here she is coming home. Let me just rewind a little bit.

753
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,430
<26-11,CASTLE>是什么时间
<26-11,CASTLE>And what does the time stamp say?

754
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,640
<26-12,BECKETT>10:47
<26-12,BECKETT>10:47.

755
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,490
<26-13,CASTLE>也在行凶时间区之内  不可能
<26-13,CASTLE>That's inside our timeline. That's impossible.

756
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,710
<26-14,BECKETT>也不是她干的
<26-14,BECKETT>It wasn't her either.

757
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,770
<26-15,CASTLE>我很肯定的
<26-15,CASTLE>I was so sure.

758
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,030
<26-16,DEMMING>我也是
<26-16,DEMMING>Tell me about it.

759
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,830
<26-17,BECKETT>伙计们  现在很晚了
<26-17,BECKETT>You know what, guys? It's late.

760
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,580
<26-17,BECKETT>今天就到此结束吧
<26-17,BECKETT>Why don't we just call it a night?

761
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,140
<26-17,BECKETT>晚安
<26-17,BECKETT>Night.

762
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,240
<27-1,CASTLE>-我回来了  -欢迎回家
<27-1,CASTLE>- Hey there. - Hi.

763
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,390
<27-3,CASTLE>你干什么呢
<27-3,CASTLE>What are you doing here?

764
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,530
<27-4,MARTHA>切特要参加一个无聊的政治活动
<27-4,MARTHA>Oh, Chet had one of his ghastly political functions.

765
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,530
<27-4,MARTHA>我需要信纸写信  我正写给

<27-4,MARTHA>玛吉以表达我对其精彩演出的赞赏
<27-4,MARTHA>to Madge to tell her how brilliant her performance was.

767
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,710
<27-5,CASTLE>别写
<27-5,CASTLE>Oh, don't do that.

768
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,650
<27-6,MARTHA>-为什么  -妈妈  她是你的死对头
<27-6,MARTHA>- Why not? - Mother, she's your rival.

769
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,960
<27-7,CASTLE>你应该打压她  而不是慰藉她
<27-7,CASTLE>You should be crushing her, not giving her comfort.

770
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,590
<27-8,MARTHA>你没事吧
<27-8,MARTHA>Are you all right?

771
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,550
<27-8,MARTHA>没事
<27-8,MARTHA>Yes.

772
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,340
<27-9,CASTLE>不
<27-9,CASTLE>No.

773
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,740
<27-9,CASTLE>替我向玛吉问好
<27-9,CASTLE>Give Madge my best.

774
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,680
<28-1,BECKETT>好极了  时间刚刚好
<28-1,BECKETT>Oh, good. You're just in time.

775
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,620
<28-1,BECKETT>我们在斯嘉丽·奥哈拉这条线索上有进展
<28-1,BECKETT>Looks like we caught a break on our Scarlett O'Hara.

776
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,830
<28-2,CASTLE>-你找到她了  -找到次要的证人
<28-2,CASTLE>- You found her? - Found the next best thing--

<28-3,BECKETT>The clerk who checked her in to the motel.

778
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,750
<28-3,BECKETT>警察在大西洋城
<28-3,BECKETT>Police picked him up in Atlantic City

<29-1,BECKETT>Why'd you leave town in such a hurry, Benny?

782
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,370
<29-1,BECKETT>自觉运气不错
<29-1,BECKETT>I was feeling lucky.

783
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,120
<29-2,BENNY>想尽快赌上几手
<29-2,BENNY>Wanted to get to the craps table fast as I could.

<29-4,BENNY>with the police down there on my behest.

787
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,080
<29-5,BECKETT>-因为我们需要跟你谈谈  -乐意效劳
<29-5,BECKETT>- Well, we wanted to talk with you. - Well, I'm happy to help.

<29-6,BENNY>只是有一个请求  你们能小声点吗
<29-6,BENNY>One favor, though. Could you not talk so loud?

789
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,720
<29-6,BENNY>我头痛得要命
<29-6,BENNY>My head is killing me.

791
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,430
<29-7,BECKETT>有一位叫斯嘉丽·奥哈拉的女子入住了
<29-7,BECKETT>when a Scarlett O'Hhara checked in.

<29-9,CASTLE>-她长什么样  -让我想上她那种
<29-9,CASTLE>- What did she look like? - I woulda done her.

794
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,580
<29-11,BECKETT>除此以外呢
<29-11,BECKETT>Anything else?

795
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,270
<29-12,BENNY>她身形比较娇小
<29-12,BENNY>Um... she was small for her size.

796
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,590
<29-13,BECKETT>你认得这个男人吗
<29-13,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

797
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,110
<29-14,BENNY>认得  这男的简直就是神经病
<29-14,BENNY>Yeah. That guy's a total nut bar.

798
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,620
<29-14,BENNY>上周  应该是上周四吧
<29-14,BENNY>Last week--think it was Thursday, matter of fact--

799
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,200
<29-14,BENNY>他开着一辆漂亮的外国货来的
<29-14,BENNY>He pulls into the motel in a fancy foreign job.

800
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:24,030
<29-14,BENNY>然后直接走进了二楼的拐角客房
<29-14,BENNY>He goes straight up to the corner room on the second floor.

801
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,710
<29-14,BENNY>几分钟之后  他冲下来
<29-14,BENNY>Couple minutes later, he charges down,

802
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,970
<29-14,BENNY>开始问我和你们问的
<29-14,BENNY>starts asking me all the same questions

803
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,540
<29-14,BENNY>同样的问题
<29-14,BENNY>you were asking me.

804
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,540
<29-14,BENNY>谁租的房间  她长什么样子
<29-14,BENNY>Who rented the room, what did she look like?

805
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,090
<29-15,CASTLE>他竟然不知道
<29-15,CASTLE>He didn't know?

806
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,450
<29-16,BENNY>我也是这么说得
<29-16,BENNY>That's what I said.

807
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,220
<29-16,BENNY>我对他说  如果他不知道房间是谁租的
<29-16,BENNY>I told him, if he had to ask me whose room it was,

808
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,330
<29-16,BENNY>他就不该二话不说径直进去
<29-16,BENNY>he shouldn't be going in there in the first place.

809
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,640
<29-16,BENNY>他气冲冲的走了  上了车  扬长而去
<29-16,BENNY>He stomped off, got in his car. He left. Boom!

810
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,920
<29-16,BENNY>再没有见过他
<29-16,BENNY>Never saw him again.

811
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,960
<29-17,BECKETT>将来也不会  他周日晚上被杀了
<29-17,BECKETT>And you won't either. He was murdered sunday night.

812
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,780
<29-18,BENNY>他的态度有问题  被杀了也不奇怪
<29-18,BENNY>With that kinda attitude, this is not surprising.

813
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,000
<29-18,BENNY>如果我的答案让你满意的话
<29-18,BENNY>Well, if I've answered all your queries to your satisfaction,

814
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,080
<29-18,BENNY>我可以走了吗
<29-18,BENNY>am I free to go?

815
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,850
<29-19,BECKETT>我想再多问一个问题
<29-19,BECKETT>Just one more query if you don't mind.

816
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,310
<29-19,BECKETT>据大西洋城的警察说  你因试图
<29-19,BECKETT>According to the atlantic city police, you were arrested

817
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
<29-19,BECKETT>在脱衣舞夜总会的钻石休闲室
<29-19,BECKETT>in the diamond lounge of a strip club

818
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,980
<29-19,BECKETT>烧死一位牛仔小丑而被捕
<29-19,BECKETT>for trying to set a rodeo clown on fire.

819
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,450
<29-20,BENNY>那是一场误会
<29-20,BENNY>That was a misunderstanding and--

820
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,550
<29-21,BECKETT>我想问的是  时薪九美元的的店员
<29-21,BECKETT>My question is, how does a $9-an-hour hotel clerk

821
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,630
<29-21,BECKETT>怎么付得起五百元一小时的贵宾室
<29-21,BECKETT>pay for a $500-an-hour VIP lounge?

822
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,820
<29-22,BENNY>我赌骰子赢了
<29-22,BENNY>I won at craps.

823
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,170
<29-22,BENNY>我说过了  我的运气不错
<29-22,BENNY>Like I said, I was feeling lucky.

824
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,460
<29-23,CASTLE>那可是戴米恩·怀尔德的包
<29-23,CASTLE>That's a Damian Wilder bag.

825
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,600
<29-24,BENNY>-谁  -本案受害者
<29-24,BENNY>- Who? - That's the guy who was killed.

826
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,640
<29-25,BECKETT>你从哪得来的
<29-25,BECKETT>Where'd you get that?

827
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,380
<29-27,BECKETT>本尼  从哪得来的
<29-27,BECKETT>Where'd you get it, Benny?

828
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,690
<29-28,BENNY>-拜托小声点  -从哪得来的
<29-28,BENNY>- Um, please, just not so loud. - Where did you get it--

829
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,860
<29-30,BENNY>我在房间里找到的
<29-30,BENNY>I found it in the room.

830
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,870
<29-31,CASTLE>斯嘉丽·奥哈拉的房间
<29-31,CASTLE>Scarlett O'Hara's room?

831
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,200
<29-32,BENNY>第四天退房之后
<29-32,BENNY>After checkout on the fourth day,

832
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,630
<29-32,BENNY>我上去盘点  她没有退钥匙
<29-32,BENNY>I went up there on account of, she never returned the key.

833
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,950
<29-32,BENNY>房间就像没人住过
<29-32,BENNY>The room was like nobody'd even been there.

834
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,090
<29-32,BENNY>床铺整洁  浴巾还在架子上
<29-32,BENNY>The bed was made, towels were on the rack.

835
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,610
<29-32,BENNY>我草草地巡视了一遍
<29-32,BENNY>I gave it a quick once-over,

836
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,040
<29-32,BENNY>打算告诉清洁工不用收拾房间了
<29-32,BENNY>figured I'd tell housekeeping not to bother going in.

837
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,540
<29-32,BENNY>结果在床底找到这个包
<29-32,BENNY>I found the bag under the bed.

838
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,690
<29-33,BECKETT>里面有什么
<29-33,BECKETT>And what was in it?

839
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,440
<29-35,BECKETT>有什么
<29-35,BECKETT>What was in it?

840
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,050
<29-36,BENNY>里面有钱  很多钱
<29-36,BENNY>There was money... lots of it.

841
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,060
<29-37,BECKETT>有多少
<29-37,BECKETT>How much?

842
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,500
<29-38,BENNY>里面有七万五千美金
<29-38,BENNY>75 grand. There.

843
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,940
<29-39,CASTLE>本尼  钱都花光了吗
<29-39,CASTLE>Did you blow it all, Benny?

844
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,590
<29-40,BENNY>这三天是我人生中最快活的日子
<29-40,BENNY>It was the best three days of my life.

845
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,540
<30-1,BECKETT>一个装满现金的行李包
<30-1,BECKETT>A duffel bag full of cash,

846
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,400
<30-1,BECKETT>一间匿名租下的客房  和愤怒的怀尔德
<30-1,BECKETT>an anonymous hotel room and an angry Wilder--

847
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,370
<30-1,BECKETT>-综上所述  只有一个结论  -勒索
<30-1,BECKETT>- All of that adds up to only one thing. - Blackmail.

848
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,200
<30-3,DEMMING>只有这个比较靠谱
<30-3,DEMMING>It's the only scenario that makes sense.

849
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,550
<30-4,BECKETT>勒索者联系并指示怀尔德
<30-4,BECKETT>So the blackmailer contacts Wilder with instructions

850
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,790
<30-4,BECKETT>于指定时间在旅店碰头
<30-4,BECKETT>to meet at the motel at a certain time.

851
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,080
<30-5,CASTLE>可能是要给他看看
<30-5,CASTLE>Probably to show him proof of

852
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,590
<30-5,CASTLE>她掌握的把柄
<30-5,CASTLE>whatever it is she has against him.

853
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,070
<30-6,BECKETT>但她不想身份被识穿
<30-6,BECKETT>But she doesn't want him to know who she is

854
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,530
<30-6,BECKETT>或者她是怀尔德公司里的职员
<30-6,BECKETT>or that she works at his company.

855
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,310
<30-7,CASTLE>于是她打电话到房间  提出要求
<30-7,CASTLE>So she calls in to the room, makes her demands by phone.

856
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:31,400
<30-8,BECKETT>他质问店员  想查出敲诈他的
<30-8,BECKETT>He confronts the clerk, trying to figure out who it

857
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,370
<30-8,BECKETT>幕后黑手
<30-8,BECKETT>is that's extorting him.

858
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,330
<30-9,CASTLE>之后某一时段
<30-9,CASTLE>At some point in time,

859
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,330
<30-9,CASTLE>怀尔德提着装满现金的行李包返回房间
<30-9,CASTLE>Wilder returns to the room with the duffel bag full of cash,

860
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,880
<30-9,CASTLE>按照指示把包放在床底
<30-9,CASTLE>puts it under the bed as instructed.

861
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,410
<30-10,BECKETT>只是本尼抢在勒索者之前
<30-10,BECKETT>Only Benny makes off with the money

862
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,310
<30-10,BECKETT>把钱拿走  匆匆离开了
<30-10,BECKETT>before the blackmailer's had a chance to pick it up.

863
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,190
<30-11,CASTLE>这让勒索者很生气
<30-11,CASTLE>Making for one angry blackmailer.

864
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,980
<30-12,BECKETT>生气到要杀人
<30-12,BECKETT>Angry enough to kill.

865
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,390
<31-1,BENNY>不  不是她  兄弟  这位死人先生
<31-1,BENNY>No, not her either. Man, this dead guy had

866
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,940
<31-1,BENNY>有一大票美女员工啊
<31-1,BENNY>a lot of good-looking babes working for him.

867
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,440
<31-2,BECKETT>没有一个是斯嘉丽·奥哈拉
<31-2,BECKETT>Any of them our Scarlett O'Hara?

868
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,200
<31-3,BENNY>不是她  也不是她  但我想上她
<31-3,BENNY>Uh, not her... Or her, but I'd do her.

869
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,770
<31-3,BENNY>不是她  这个我可不想上
<31-3,BENNY>Not her, who I would not do.

870
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,160
<31-3,BENNY>不是她  我可能会上她
<31-3,BENNY>Not her. I would maybe do her.

871
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,750
<31-3,BENNY>找到了  是她
<31-3,BENNY>Hey, look. It's her.

872
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,020
<31-4,BECKETT>你确定是这女人来租房的
<31-4,BECKETT>You're sure this is the woman who rented the room?

873
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,020
<31-5,BENNY>没错
<31-5,BENNY>Yes.

874
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,750
<31-6,BECKETT>瑞贝卡·斯特朗  她是公司的实验室研究员
<31-6,BECKETT>Rebecca Strong. She's a lab tech at the company.

875
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,090
<31-7,CASTLE>好一双残酷的眼睛
<31-7,CASTLE>Oh, she's got cruel eyes.

876
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,410
<31-7,CASTLE>我想她一定很享受看着怀尔德痛苦死去
<31-7,CASTLE>I'll bet she enjoyed watching Wilder suffer.

877
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,100
<32-2,CASTLE>她在说什么
<32-2,CASTLE>What did she say?

878
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,390
<32-3,BECKETT>"我到底在想什么  我不该插手的"
<32-3,BECKETT>"What was I thinking? I should've stayed out of it."

879
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,900
<32-3,BECKETT>她在哭诉  女生们都从
<32-3,BECKETT>It's cry talk. There's not a girl alive who hasn't heard it

880
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,550
<32-3,BECKETT>伤心欲绝的女性朋友那听过
<32-3,BECKETT>from a sobbing, heartbroken girlfriend.

881
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,580
<32-3,BECKETT>瑞贝卡  你不该插手什么事
<32-3,BECKETT>What should you have stayed out of, Rebecca,

882
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,390
<32-4,REBECCA>勒索吗
<32-4,REBECCA>the blackmail?

883
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,650
<32-5,BECKETT>你本想做正确的事
<32-5,BECKETT>You tried to do the right thing?

884
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,100
<32-7,BECKETT>那是怎么回事  你有帮凶吗
<32-7,BECKETT>Well, who wouldn't listen? Did you have an accomplice?

885
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,870
<32-9,BECKETT>-就我一个  -那到底发生了什么
<32-9,BECKETT>- Was just me.  - Well, then what is this all about?

886
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,430
<32-10,REBECCA>苯并化合物
<32-10,REBECCA>Benzophyosopheme.

887
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
<32-11,BECKETT>抱歉  我没听懂
<32-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I didn't get that one.

888
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,580
<32-10,REBECCA>苯并化合物
<32-10,REBECCA>Benzophyosopheme.

889
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,000
<32-13,CASTLE>那不是哭诉  听起来像是某种化合物
<32-13,CASTLE>That's not cry talk. It sounds like a chemical compound.

890
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,670
<32-14,BECKETT>你负责产品测试  对吗
<32-14,BECKETT>You work in product testing, right?

891
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,310
<32-14,BECKETT>他们在公司的一种产品里
<32-14,BECKETT>Were they using benzophyosopheme

892
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,380
<32-14,BECKETT>使用了苯并化合物吗
<32-14,BECKETT>in a company product?

893
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,110
<32-15,CASTLE>这样做会有什么问题吗
<32-15,CASTLE>Is there some kind of problem with it?

894
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,490
<32-15,CASTLE>和这个勒索有关吗
<32-15,CASTLE>Is that what the blackmail was about?

895
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,470
<32-16,BECKETT>你说过
<32-16,BECKETT>So then when you said

896
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,050
<32-16,BECKETT>你打算做正确的事
<32-16,BECKETT>that you were trying to do the right thing,

897
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,430
<32-16,BECKETT>-你向你的上级报告了吗  -有过
<32-16,BECKETT>- Did you approach your superiors about the problem? - Yes.

898
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,810
<32-18,BECKETT>-怀尔德采取行动了吗  -没有
<32-18,BECKETT>- And did Wilder do anything about it?  - No.

899
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,900
<32-19,REBECCA>他生产了一种成品
<32-19,REBECCA>He came out with a product

900
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,160
<32-20,CASTLE>-里面有苯并化合物  -是的
<32-20,CASTLE>-that has benzophyosopheme in it anyway.  - Exactly.

901
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,580
<32-22,CASTLE>有什么严重副作用吗
<32-22,CASTLE>Well, how bad is this stuff?

902
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,630
<32-23,REBECCA>长时间使用  会损伤毛细血管
<32-23,REBECCA>It can cause capillary damage if you use it long enough.

903
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,220
<32-24,BECKETT>你想到  既然他们不听你的
<32-24,BECKETT>So then you figured, if they weren't gonna listen to you,

904
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,460
<32-24,BECKETT>干嘛不借此获利
<32-24,BECKETT>why not cash in on it?

905
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,830
<32-24,BECKETT>所以威胁道  你将公布于众
<32-24,BECKETT>And then you threatened to make it public

906
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,920
<32-24,BECKETT>除非怀尔德给你七万五千美元
<32-24,BECKETT>If Wilder didn't give you $75,000.

907
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,230
<32-26,BECKETT>-是的  -你真是胆大妄为  瑞贝卡
<32-26,BECKETT>- Yes. - Well, you were in over your head, Rebecca.

908
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,040
<32-27,REBECCA>我明白  我只想一切回到正轨
<32-27,REBECCA>I know, and I want to make things right if I can.

909
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:44,830
<32-28,BECKETT>为时已晚
<32-28,BECKETT>It's too late for that now.

910
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,790
<32-29,REBECCA>如果我把钱还回来
<32-29,REBECCA>I--what if I gave it back?

911
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,540
<32-31,REBECCA>-你杀了人了  -钱原封未动
<32-31,REBECCA>- You killed a man.  - I still have the money.

912
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,470
<32-32,BECKETT>-钱原封未动  -我杀人了
<32-32,BECKETT>- You still have the money?  - I killed a man?

913
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,050
<32-35,REBECCA>-戴米恩·怀尔德  -怀尔德先生不是我杀的
<32-35,REBECCA>- Damian Wilder. - I didn't kill Mr. Wilder.

914
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,260
<32-36,BECKETT>-钱在你手上  -还在我从
<32-36,BECKETT>- You have the money? - It's still

915
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,660
<32-37,REBECCA>床底下拿出的那个行李包里面
<32-37,REBECCA>in the duffel bag that I got from under the bed.

916
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,760
<32-38,BECKETT>等等  是放在汽车旅馆里的钱
<32-38,BECKETT>Wait. The money from the motel room?

917
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,880
<32-39,REBECCA>七万五千美元
<32-39,REBECCA>$75,000.

918
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,550
<32-40,BECKETT>那本尼找到的钱
<32-40,BECKETT>Well, then the money that Benny found...

919
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,710
<32-41,CASTLE>来自哪里
<32-41,CASTLE>Where did it come from?

920
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,910
<32-41,CASTLE>七万五千美元
<32-41,CASTLE>$75,000.

921
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,020
<33-1,DEMMING>如她所说  就在她客厅的壁橱里
<33-1,DEMMING>It was in her hall closet just like she said it'd be.

922
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,550
<33-2,CASTLE>两份勒索款  我糊涂了
<33-2,CASTLE>Two blackmail payoffs? I don't get it.

923
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,170
<33-3,BECKETT>瑞贝卡一定是取钱时
<33-3,BECKETT>Rebecca must have missed the second duffel bag

924
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,910
<33-3,BECKETT>没有拿走床下第二个行李包
<33-3,BECKETT>under the bed when she went to pick up the money.

925
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,460
<33-4,DEMMING>所以本尼才会
<33-4,DEMMING>Which is why Benny found it

926
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,120
<33-4,DEMMING>之后找到了另一个
<33-4,DEMMING>when he went back there later.

927
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,430
<33-5,BECKETT>但我们详细调查过
<33-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but we looked through Wilder's financials

928
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:23,200
<33-5,BECKETT>怀尔德的财产情况
<33-5,BECKETT>with a fine-tooth comb.

929
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,700
<33-5,BECKETT>没有线索证明是
<33-5,BECKETT>There was nothing in there to suggest that

930
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,500
<33-5,BECKETT>他出了这笔钱
<33-5,BECKETT>he pulled that kind of cash.

931
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,510
<33-6,DEMMING>也很难想象他没有出钱
<33-6,DEMMING>It's hard to imagine he had it just lying around.

932
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,980
<33-7,CASTLE>如果怀尔德没付钱  后果是什么
<33-7,CASTLE>What would happen if Wilder didn't pay the blackmailer?

933
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,200
<33-8,BECKETT>那就会让产品损伤
<33-8,BECKETT>Well, that would mean letting

934
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,580
<33-8,BECKETT>毛细血管的事情曝光
<33-8,BECKETT>the capillary damage issue go public.

935
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,980
<33-9,CASTLE>如果他不在乎呢
<33-9,CASTLE>What if he didn't care?

936
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,750
<33-9,CASTLE>如果他打算做正确的选择
<33-9,CASTLE>What if he wanted to do the right thing

937
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,730
<33-9,CASTLE>召回这种产品  尽管意味着
<33-9,CASTLE>and pull the product, even if it meant

938
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,960
<33-9,CASTLE>巨大的财政损失和诉讼
<33-9,CASTLE>a huge financial hit and possible litigation?

939
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,740
<33-10,BECKETT>那么拥有公司股份的人
<33-10,BECKETT>Then anyone with a financial stake in the company

940
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,610
<33-10,BECKETT>就有阻止此事曝光的动机了
<33-10,BECKETT>Would have incentive to keep that from happening.

941
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,870
<33-11,CASTLE>万无一失的办法就是将怀尔德灭口
<33-11,CASTLE>And the surest way to do that would be to kill Wilder

942
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,180
<33-11,CASTLE>并付清勒索款
<33-11,CASTLE>And pay off the blackmailer.

943
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,030
<33-12,BECKETT>既然这位表哥借给了怀尔德公司的启动资金
<33-12,BECKETT>So the cousin would have company stock worth a fortune

944
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,710
<33-12,BECKETT>那他在公司里的股份不会是小数目
<33-12,BECKETT>from when he lent Wilder the start-up money.

945
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,050
<33-13,CASTLE>是的  但不是他干的
<33-13,CASTLE>Yeah, but we know he didn't do it.

946
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,990
<33-14,BECKETT>丽莎·詹金斯  是她将这种危险产品推向市场的
<33-14,BECKETT>And then Lisa Jenkins could be looking at criminal liability

947
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,970
<33-14,BECKETT>为防止东窗事发  她也有杀人动机
<33-14,BECKETT>if it got out that she let a dangerous product go to market.

948
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,490
<33-15,DEMMING>是的  但也不是她干的
<33-15,DEMMING>Yeah, but we know she didn't do it either.

949
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,640
<33-16,BECKETT>-事情到这就说不通了  -卡塞尔
<33-16,BECKETT>- Well, something doesn't make sense here.  - Castle.

950
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,430
<33-19,ESPOSITO>过来
<33-19,ESPOSITO>Come here.

951
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,610
<33-20,CASTLE>怎么了  伙计们
<33-20,CASTLE>Hey. Uh, what's wrong, guys?

952
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
<33-21,RYAN>苯并化合物
<33-21,RYAN>Benzophyosopheme.

953
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,980
<33-22,CASTLE>不  不会在剃须膏里吧
<33-22,CASTLE>Oh, no. Not the shave cream.

954
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,360
<33-23,ESPOSITO>是的  就在剃须膏里  瓶子上就写着
<33-23,ESPOSITO>Yeah, in the shave cream. It says here right on the can.

955
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,820
<33-24,RYAN>那就是挤出来是热的原因
<33-24,RYAN>That's how they get it to come out hot.

956
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,770
<33-25,ESPOSITO>还不如用汽油刮胡子呢  老兄
<33-25,ESPOSITO>Might as well just be shaving with napalm, bro.

957
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,660
<33-26,CASTLE>她说  长期使用才会有损害
<33-26,CASTLE>Well, she said it only does damage long term.

958
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,230
<33-26,CASTLE>你们才用过一次而已
<33-26,CASTLE>You guys have only used it the one time.

959
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,980
<33-26,CASTLE>我也刚用第一瓶
<33-26,CASTLE>I'm still on my first can.

960
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,780
<33-27,RYAN>有可能搞个毛细血管永久损伤
<33-27,RYAN>Coulda ended up with irreversible capillary damage.

961
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,960
<33-28,CASTLE>我只是
<33-28,CASTLE>I was...

962
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,080
<33-29,BECKETT>时间区有问题
<33-29,BECKETT>The timeline's wrong.

963
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,380
<33-30,CASTLE>就是  用这么短时间不会有事的
<33-30,CASTLE>Exactly. There wasn't time to do any damage.

964
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,110
<33-31,BECKETT>-不是  是说谋杀案  -你在说什么
<33-31,BECKETT>- No, for the murder.  - What are you talking about?

965
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,620
<33-32,CASTLE>她在说什么
<33-32,CASTLE>What is she talking about?

966
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,800
<33-34,CASTLE>-不清楚  -你去哪
<33-34,CASTLE>- I don't know.  - Where you going?

967
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,350
<33-35,BECKETT>怀尔德的公寓  我知道谁干的
<33-35,BECKETT>Wilder's apartment. I know who did it.

968
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,890
<33-35,BECKETT>我知道谁杀了他
<33-35,BECKETT>I know who killed him.

969
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,030
<33-35,BECKETT>-谁  -谁
<33-35,BECKETT>- Who?  -Who?

970
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,380
<33-35,BECKETT>我对戴米恩·怀尔德的胸口开了一枪
<33-35,BECKETT>I just shot Damian Wilder in the chest,

971
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,810
<34-1,BECKETT>他开始流血
<34-1,BECKETT>and he's bleeding out.

972
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,210
<34-1,BECKETT>屋子里很黑
<34-1,BECKETT>It's dark.

973
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,790
<34-1,BECKETT>但我依然可以蘸取一些血迹
<34-1,BECKETT>But I still manage to sop up some of the blood

974
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,370
<34-1,BECKETT>之后来到这里
<34-1,BECKETT>and I head over here

975
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,210
<34-1,BECKETT>开始写留言
<34-1,BECKETT>to start writing the message,

976
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,860
<34-1,BECKETT>暗示凶手是抗议者
<34-1,BECKETT>implicating the protestors.

977
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,010
<34-1,BECKETT>但用时比我想象的要长
<34-1,BECKETT>But it takes longer than I thought it would because

978
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,610
<34-1,BECKETT>因为我需要不断去取血液
<34-1,BECKETT>I keep having to go back in order to get more blood.

979
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,030
<34-1,BECKETT>然后突然间  我听到后面有声音
<34-1,BECKETT>And then all of a sudden, I hear a noise out the back.

980
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,530
<34-1,BECKETT>我停下来了  告诉自己
<34-1,BECKETT>So I stop and I think to myself,

981
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,430
<34-1,BECKETT>算了  最好赶紧离开
<34-1,BECKETT>You know what? I better get the hell outta here.

982
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,630
<34-2,CASTLE>等等  你忘记了击打的部分
<34-2,CASTLE>Hold on. You're forgetting about the bludgeoning part.

983
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,990
<34-3,BECKETT>我从前门出去了  把门锁上
<34-3,BECKETT>I walk out the front door and I let it lock behind me.

984
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,070
<34-3,BECKETT>我快速穿过马路  叫了出租车
<34-3,BECKETT>I race across the street, I hail a cab,

985
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,990
<34-3,BECKETT>这时是10:40
<34-3,BECKETT>and it's about 10:40.

986
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,560
<34-4,DEMMING>但现在  你忘了被偷的书
<34-4,DEMMING>Yeah, but now you're forgetting about the stolen books.

987
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,200
<34-5,CASTLE>外面的声音  你认为还有其他人
<34-5,CASTLE>The noise outside. You're thinking there was someone else.

988
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,640
<34-6,BECKETT>那个人绝对没想到
<34-6,BECKETT>Someone who had no idea that

989
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,350
<34-6,BECKETT>怀尔德已经被枪击了
<34-6,BECKETT>Wilder had already been shot.

990
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,960
<34-6,BECKETT>有人从后院进入了卧室
<34-6,BECKETT>Someone who came in through the back into the bedroom,

991
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,680
<34-6,BECKETT>在黑暗中  找到了一件重物
<34-6,BECKETT>And in the dark, found a heavy object

992
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,790
<34-6,BECKETT>-在床上对他猛击  -两名凶手
<34-6,BECKETT>- and bludgeoned him in his bed.  - Two killers.

993
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,900
<34-7,DEMMING>第二名凶手偷走了书籍
<34-7,DEMMING>So it's the second killer who steals the books.

994
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,700
<34-8,BECKETT>将那些书
<34-8,BECKETT>And then getting those books

995
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,210
<34-8,BECKETT>从陈列柜中拿出来
<34-8,BECKETT>out of this display case.

996
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,760
<34-8,BECKETT>几分钟后
<34-8,BECKETT>Takes a few minutes,

997
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,610
<34-8,BECKETT>他就走到屋外了
<34-8,BECKETT>after which, it's out the door,

998
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,350
<34-8,BECKETT>这时是10:52
<34-8,BECKETT>and it's 10:52.

999
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,760
<34-9,CASTLE>这就给了第一位凶手足够的时间回家
<34-9,CASTLE>Giving the first killer more than enough time to get home,

1000
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,890
<34-9,CASTLE>她就可以被看见  比如说监视摄像头
<34-9,CASTLE>where she can be seen by, let's say, a security camera.

1001
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,540
<34-10,DEMMING>第二名凶手就不会
<34-10,DEMMING>And the second killer wouldn't appear to

1002
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,300
<34-10,DEMMING>被牵扯进去
<34-10,DEMMING>be involved if he was,

1003
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:26,320
<34-10,DEMMING>比如说  开枪时他在买香烟
<34-10,DEMMING>say, buying cigarettes when the gunshot went off.

1004
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,660
<34-11,BECKETT>丽莎和布雷克先后过来谋杀怀尔德
<34-11,BECKETT>Lisa and Blake came here separately to kill Wilder,

1005
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,720
<34-11,BECKETT>通过这样
<34-11,BECKETT>and by doing that,

1006
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,190
<34-11,BECKETT>他们碰巧给了彼此不在场证明
<34-11,BECKETT>they both inadvertently alibied each other out.

1007
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,490
<34-12,CASTLE>他们清楚在怀尔德坦白一切之前
<34-12,CASTLE>They both knew it was their only chance

1008
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,300
<34-12,CASTLE>这是唯一的机会了
<34-12,CASTLE>to stop Wilder before he stepped forward.

1009
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,010
<34-12,CASTLE>他要举行的那个新闻发布会
<34-12,CASTLE>The press conference he had called...

1010
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,100
<34-12,CASTLE>不是关于动物权利的
<34-12,CASTLE>It was not about animal rights.

1011
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,810
<34-12,CASTLE>他要发布产品的召回声明
<34-12,CASTLE>He was about to announce a product recall.

1012
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,490
<34-13,DEMMING>他们各自都决定不能让这一幕发生
<34-13,DEMMING>And they each decided they couldn't let that happen.

1013
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,720
<34-13,DEMMING>他们一前一后杀了他  而且两人都付了勒索款
<34-13,DEMMING>They both killed him, and they both paid the blackmailer.

1014
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,110
<34-14,BECKETT>这就意味着  他们都得短时间内
<34-14,BECKETT>Which means they both had to raise a lot of money

1015
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,540
<34-14,BECKETT>筹集一大笔钱
<34-14,BECKETT>in not a lot of time.

1016
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,110
<35-1,BECKETT>我们发现他们从银行户头
<35-1,BECKETT>We found withdrawals from bank accounts,

1017
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,680
<35-1,BECKETT>货币市场基金  甚至是养老基金中取款
<35-1,BECKETT>money market funds, even 401ks,

1018
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,080
<35-1,BECKETT>两个人取款加起来都为七万五千美金
<35-1,BECKETT>All of it totaling $75,000 from each one of them.

1019
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,690
<35-2,MONTGOMERY>他们没有掩盖痕迹   因为他们不认为
<35-2,MONTGOMERY>They didn't cover their tracks because they didn't think

1020
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,560
<35-2,MONTGOMERY>有人会查到勒索款并去调查
<35-2,MONTGOMERY>anyone would get on to the blackmail and come looking.

1021
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,290
<35-3,BECKETT>原来布雷克欠下大笔债款
<35-3,BECKETT>It turns out Blake was leveraged in debt up to his eyeballs.

1022
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,380
<35-3,BECKETT>如果公司的股票遭受打击
<35-3,BECKETT>If the company stock had taken a hit,

1023
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:15,210
<35-3,BECKETT>-他的人生就天塌地陷了  -她呢
<35-3,BECKETT>- The whole house of cards would've fallen.  - And her?

1024
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,560
<35-5,BECKETT>她不愿在牢狱中浪费青春
<35-5,BECKETT>She didn't want to serve time.

1025
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,580
<35-5,BECKETT>尽管剃须膏存在着严重问题
<35-5,BECKETT>She's the one who sat on initial reports

1026
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,930
<35-5,BECKETT>但她还是通过了最初的检测报告
<35-5,BECKETT>that there were problems with the shaving cream.

1027
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,170
<35-6,MONTGOMERY>可怜的怀尔德
<35-6,MONTGOMERY>Poor Wilder.

1028
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,660
<35-6,MONTGOMERY>做出正确的抉择  却招来杀身之祸
<35-6,MONTGOMERY>Tried to do the right thing and gets himself killed.

1029
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,890
<35-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔和戴明一开始  就找对了目标
<35-7,BECKETT>Castle and Demming were right about the two of them all along.

1030
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,860
<35-8,MONTGOMERY>你也不错  让他们都有了捉拿嫌犯的满足感
<35-8,MONTGOMERY>Nice of you to give them both the satisfaction of taking down their suspect.

1031
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,530
<35-9,BECKETT>这是我力所能及的
<35-9,BECKETT>Oh, well, it's the least I can do...

1032
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,010
<35-9,BECKETT>男人的虚荣心啊
<35-9,BECKETT>Male vanity being what it is.

1033
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,930
<36-2,DEMMING>听着  谢谢...
<36-2,DEMMING>So listen, thanks...

1034
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,540
<36-3,CASTLE>谢谢你的帮忙
<36-3,CASTLE>Thanks for your help on this one.

1035
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,070
<36-4,DEMMING>同一个团队嘛
<36-4,DEMMING>Oh, you know, same team.

1036
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,870
<36-5,CASTLE>回见了
<36-5,CASTLE>Guess I'll see you around.

1037

<36-5,CASTLE>好
<36-5,CASTLE>Yeah.

1038
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,030
<37-1,RYAN>一起谋杀案  两名凶手
<37-1,RYAN>One murder, two killers.

1039
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,430
<37-1,RYAN>那可不是天天见得到的
<37-1,RYAN>That's something you don't see every day.

1040
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,770
<37-2,ESPOSITO>绝对可以为记录大全添上一笔
<37-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah. That's definitely another one for the record books.

1041
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,490
<37-3,CASTLE>看见贝克特了吗  我要祝贺她
<37-3,CASTLE>You guys seen Beckett? I wanted to congratulate her.

1042
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,650
<37-3,CASTLE>是她解开谜团的
<37-3,CASTLE>She's the one who cracked this one open.

1043
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,190
<37-4,ESPOSITO>我想她在后面处理起诉的事
<37-4,ESPOSITO>I think she's in the back processing the charges.

1044

<37-5,CASTLE>多谢

<37-6,BECKETT>Nothing but net, though.

1047
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,340
<37-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<37-6,BECKETT>Castle.

1048
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,160
<37-6,BECKETT>你还在这里干什么
<37-6,BECKETT>What are you still doing here?

1049

<37-7,CASTLE>Good job closing the case.
