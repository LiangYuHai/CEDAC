<4-25,CASTLE>I can't believe you would blow off illegal fireworks

69
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,290
<4-25,CASTLE>就为了提前开始无聊的顶级教育
<4-25,CASTLE>for a lousy head start at a top-notch education.

70
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,080

76
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,640

<4-28,ALEXIS>No, it's a summer program for high school students

77
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,970

<4-29,CASTLE>at a college.

78
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,150

<4-29,CASTLE>According to this, half the kids in your building

<4-32,MARTHA>亲爱的  别那么老古板了
<4-32,MARTHA>Darling, don't be such a prude.

84

<4-32,MARTHA>你还记得你和全班人去意大利旅行那次吗
<4-32,MARTHA>Remember that trip you took to Italy with your class?

85
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,310
<4-32,MARTHA>你当时还没有阿丽克西斯大呢
<4-32,MARTHA>You were younger than Alexis is now.

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,350
<4-33,CASTLE>老妈  如果你知道那趟旅行中发生了什么
<4-33,CASTLE>Mother, if you had any idea what happened on that trip,

<4-33,CASTLE>你永远都不会让我再离家半步的
<4-33,CASTLE>you would've never let me leave the house again.

88
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,290
<4-34,MARTHA>有些时候  知道的越少越好
<4-34,MARTHA>Sometimes, the less you know, the better.

90
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,280
<4-36,MARTHA>你还有本小说要写呢
<4-36,MARTHA>You have a novel to finish.

91
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,060
<4-37,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<4-37,CASTLE>It's Castle.

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,650
<5-1,CASTLE>就像是传统的节日
<5-1,CASTLE>It's kinda like a tradition--

93
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,540
<5-1,CASTLE>篝火啦  烤棉花糖啦
<5-1,CASTLE>You know, bonfires, roasting marshmallows,

<5-1,CASTLE>讲鬼故事啦  熬夜啦
<5-1,CASTLE>telling ghost stories, sleeping late.

95
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,820
<5-1,CASTLE>从她五岁起我们一直如此
<5-1,CASTLE>We've done it since she was 5.

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,070
<5-2,BECKETT>听起来不错  老实说  蛮神奇的
<5-2,BECKETT>Sounds nice. Kinda magical, actually.

98
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,090
<5-3,CASTLE>就在海边  还有私家泳池
<5-3,CASTLE>Oh, it's right on the ocean. There's a secluded pool.

99
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,170
<5-3,CASTLE>你可以躺那  晒晒太阳
<5-3,CASTLE>You could lay out, work on your tan.

100
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,400
<5-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  为了一睹我的泳装造型
<5-4,BECKETT>Wow, Castle, you're working really hard

101
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,990
<5-4,BECKETT>你还真是不遗余力啊
<5-4,BECKETT>to see me in a swimsuit.

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,730
<5-5,CASTLE>如果你不喜欢穿泳装的话
<5-5,CASTLE>If you are not comfortable in a swimsuit,

103
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,600
<5-5,CASTLE>你可以裸泳哦
<5-5,CASTLE>you can just skinny-dip.

104
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,260
<5-6,ESPOSITO>死者是白人男性
<5-6,ESPOSITO>The vic's a white male,

105
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,260
<5-6,ESPOSITO>胸部多处中枪
<5-6,ESPOSITO>multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

106
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,380
<5-6,ESPOSITO>大约一小时前发现他的
<5-6,ESPOSITO>Found him about an hour ago.

107
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,910
<5-7,CASTLE>抢劫吗
<5-7,CASTLE>Mugging?

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,670
<5-8,ESPOSITO>不是  手表钱包和现金都在
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Nah. He still has his watch, wallet and cash.

109
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,720
<5-9,RYAN>还有就是幽灵般消失的子弹
<5-9,RYAN>Then there's the matter of the phantom bullets.

110
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,400
<5-10,ESPOSITO>是的  他胸口一共中了五枪
<5-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he took five to the chest.

111
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,100
<5-10,ESPOSITO>没有弹头  没有弹壳
<5-10,ESPOSITO>There are no slugs, shell casings.

112
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,130
<5-10,ESPOSITO>凶手甚至把子弹从那些树枝里
<5-10,ESPOSITO>the killer went so far as to dig his bullets out of

113
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,460
<5-10,ESPOSITO>挖了出来
<5-10,ESPOSITO>that tree branch right there.

114
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,090
<5-11,BECKETT>真怪异  死者体内也没有吗
<5-11,BECKETT>That's weird. What about in the body?

115
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,220
<5-12,LANIE>子弹全部射穿了死者身体
<5-12,LANIE>They're all through and throughs.

116
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,280
<5-12,LANIE>每处伤口都有子弹射出的弹孔
<5-12,LANIE>Exit holes on each wound.

117
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,050
<5-13,BECKETT>也就是说案发后凶手清理了现场
<5-13,BECKETT>So our doer cleaned up after himself.

118
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,070
<5-14,CASTLE>往一个人胸口连开五枪之后
<5-14,CASTLE>It takes real presence of mind

119
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,010
<5-14,CASTLE>仍能保持头脑冷静
<5-14,CASTLE>to put five bullets into a man's chest

120
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,570
<5-14,CASTLE>把现场收拾干净
<5-14,CASTLE>and then keep your cool long enough

121
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,220
<5-14,CASTLE>需要相当的心理素质
<5-14,CASTLE>to pick up after yourself.

122
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,730
<5-14,CASTLE>本能反应是杀完就跑
<5-14,CASTLE>Natural instinct is to run.

123
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,090
<5-14,CASTLE>我猜我们在对付的极可能是
<5-14,CASTLE>I would say we are most likely dealing with

124
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,040
<5-14,CASTLE>一个训练有素的杀手
<5-14,CASTLE>a highly trained assassin.

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,870
<5-15,BECKETT>死亡时间呢
<5-15,BECKETT>Time of death?

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,230
<5-16,LANIE>从尸体温度和尸斑来看
<5-16,LANIE>Based on temperature and lividity,

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,860
<5-16,LANIE>我想是在晚上十一点到凌晨一点之间
<5-16,LANIE>I'd say between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am.

128
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,590
<5-17,BECKETT>身份呢
<5-17,BECKETT>ID?

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,180
<5-18,LANIE>肖恩·卡维尔  没发现驾照
<5-18,LANIE>Shawn Caldwell. No driver's license,

130
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,180
<5-18,LANIE>但根据他的工作证
<5-18,LANIE>but according to his work ID,

131
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,580
<5-18,LANIE>他是市区一间名叫FGS公司的顾问
<5-18,LANIE>he was a consultant for FGS in midtown.

132
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,430
<5-19,BECKETT>激流环球服务公司
<5-19,BECKETT>"Fastwater Global Services"?

133
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,050
<5-20,CASTLE>像是中情局的掩护身份
<5-20,CASTLE>Sounds like a CIA front.

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,110
<5-21,RYAN>在他口袋里发现了这些
<5-21,RYAN>Found these in his pocket.

135
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,230
<5-22,BECKETT>公司的车钥匙
<5-22,BECKETT>Company car keys.

136
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,340
<5-22,BECKETT>钥匙圈上没有住家钥匙
<5-22,BECKETT>There's no house keys on the chain.

137
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,660
<5-22,BECKETT>这里有张很普通的宾馆房卡
<5-22,BECKETT>There's a generic hotel key card.

138
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,920
<5-23,CASTLE>外地来的吗
<5-23,CASTLE>In from out of town?

139
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,850
<5-24,BECKETT>但公司地址是本地的
<5-24,BECKETT>Except the company address is local,

140
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,590
<5-24,BECKETT>他的健身会员卡也是
<5-24,BECKETT>and so is his gym membership.

141
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,100
<5-24,BECKETT>好了  让鉴证组检查现场吧
<5-24,BECKETT>All right. Have CSU sweep the area,

142
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,070
<5-24,BECKETT>再询问那些流浪者
<5-24,BECKETT>canvass the homeless people,

143
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,580
<5-24,BECKETT>看是否有人听到或看到些什么
<5-24,BECKETT>see if anyone saw or heard anything.

144
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,190
<6-1,CASTLE>俺家阳台的海景
<6-1,CASTLE>Ocean view from my patio.

145
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,420
<6-1,CASTLE>没有比这个更好的地方了
<6-1,CASTLE>It does not get better than this.

146
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:26,980
<6-1,CASTLE>怎么了
<6-1,CASTLE>What's wrong?

147
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,690
<6-2,BECKETT>我查了所有资料  搜遍了数据库
<6-2,BECKETT>I tried information, our database.

148
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,210
<6-2,BECKETT>甚至上网进行了搜索
<6-2,BECKETT>I even did an internet search,

149
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,560
<6-2,BECKETT>-这些人仿佛根本就不存在  -哪些人
<6-2,BECKETT>- And it's like these guys don't even exist. - Who?

150
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,170
<6-4,BECKETT>激流环球服务公司
<6-4,BECKETT>Fastwater Global Services.

151
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,530
<6-5,CASTLE>看  我就说吧  中情局的伪装
<6-5,CASTLE>Ah! See? I told you. CIA cover.

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
<6-5,CASTLE>开玩笑的  他们可能是不喜欢做广告
<6-5,CASTLE>No. I mean, they probably just don't like to advertise.

153
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,700
<6-6,BECKETT>没错  我起初也这么想
<6-6,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I thought so as well,

154
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,710
<6-6,BECKETT>所以我查了他们的地址
<6-6,BECKETT>so I checked their address--

155
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,350
<6-6,BECKETT>西43街  1747号
<6-6,BECKETT>1747 West 43rd Str.

156
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,830
<6-6,BECKETT>那是在哈德逊河里
<6-6,BECKETT>It's in the middle of the Hudson River.

157
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,810
<6-6,BECKETT>所以我又检查了他的钱包
<6-6,BECKETT>So I went back and checked through his wallet

158
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,700
<6-6,BECKETT>查看了他的证件  健身会员卡
<6-6,BECKETT>and looked at his IDs, his gym membership,

159
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,000
<6-6,BECKETT>医疗保险  甚至他的自动提款卡
<6-6,BECKETT>health insurance, even his ATM card--

160
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,400
<6-7,CASTLE>-全是假的  -你查过他的名字了吗
<6-7,CASTLE>- They're all fakes. - You run his name?

161
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,670
<6-8,BECKETT>查了  纽约以及新泽西  康涅狄格州有六个
<6-8,BECKETT>Yeah, there's about half a dozen Shawn Caldwells

162
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,740
<6-8,BECKETT>肖恩·卡维尔  但没一个吻合的
<6-8,BECKETT>in the tristate area, and none of them are a match.

163
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,910
<6-10,BECKETT>-那他的指纹呢  -我们的数据库里没有
<6-10,BECKETT>- What about his fingerprints? - Not in our system.

164
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,510
<6-11,RYAN>-贝克特  -有什么发现
<6-11,RYAN>- Hey, Beckett. - Hey, what'd you guys find?

165
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,100
<6-13,RYAN>我们询问了一些昨晚
<6-13,RYAN>Well, we spoke to some homeless guys who were camped

166
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,870
<6-13,RYAN>在距桥几百码处露宿的流浪汉
<6-13,RYAN>a couple hundred yards from the overpass last night.

167
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,350
<6-13,RYAN>他们没听到或看到任何事情
<6-13,RYAN>They didn't see or hear anything.

168
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,010
<6-14,CASTLE>几百码
<6-14,CASTLE>Couple hundred yards?

169
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,530
<6-14,CASTLE>五声枪响  怎么可能没听到
<6-14,CASTLE>How do you not hear five gunshots?

170
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,390
<6-15,BECKETT>-除非  -凶手用了消音器
<6-15,BECKETT>- Unless... - He used a silencer.

171
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,830
<6-16,CASTLE>用装了消音器的枪  杀一个故意掩藏身份的人
<6-16,CASTLE>To kill a man who went out of the way to hide who he was?

172
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,000
<6-17,ESPOSITO>这听起来越来越像
<6-17,ESPOSITO>This is starting to sound more and more

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,020
<6-17,ESPOSITO>职业杀手干的了
<6-17,ESPOSITO>like a professional hit.

174
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,210
<6-18,BECKETT>是啊  只有查出受害者的身份
<6-18,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we're nowhere until we figure out

175
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,400
<6-18,BECKETT>我们才能有所突破
<6-18,BECKETT>who this guy actually is.

176
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,510
<6-18,BECKETT>你们去查查公园
<6-18,BECKETT>So why don't you guys go canvass the area

177
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,110
<6-18,BECKETT>入口的区域吧  看是否能找到他的车
<6-18,BECKETT>near the entrance to the park, see if you can find his car?

178
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,980
<6-18,BECKETT>另外  把他的照片传真给本地宾馆
<6-18,BECKETT>And fax his photo to the local hotels,

179
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,260
<6-18,BECKETT>-看是否有人能认出他  -这就去
<6-18,BECKETT>- see if anyone recognizes his face. - Right on.

180
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,380
<6-20,CASTLE>你知道...
<6-20,CASTLE>You know, I-I was...

181
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,630
<6-20,CASTLE>关于杀手的说法  我是开玩笑的
<6-20,CASTLE>I was kidding about the assassin stuff.

182
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,940
<6-21,BECKETT>是蕾妮
<6-21,BECKETT>That's Lanie.

183
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,930
<6-21,BECKETT>拜托  告诉我你有发现了
<6-21,BECKETT>Please tell me that you found something.

184
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,650
<6-22,LANIE>关于被害人的身份
<6-22,LANIE>Well, I found nothing that sheds light

185
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,000
<6-22,LANIE>我一无所获
<6-22,LANIE>on the identity of your victim,

186
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,200
<6-22,LANIE>但我发现了些线索  也许能帮你们找到凶手
<6-22,LANIE>But I did find something that may help with your killer.

187
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,510
<6-22,LANIE>我们知道凶手清理了犯罪现场的
<6-22,LANIE>We know the shooter tried to scrub the crime scene

188
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,900
<6-22,LANIE>弹道痕迹  但有一发子弹
<6-22,LANIE>of ballistic evidence, but one of the rounds

189
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,150
<6-22,LANIE>射中了卡维尔的肋骨  留下了线索
<6-22,LANIE>shattered Mr. Caldwell's rib and left this little souvenir.

190
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,150
<6-23,BECKETT>-子弹碎片  -分不清枪支的口径
<6-23,BECKETT>- A bullet fragment?  - Can't tell the caliber,

191
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,800
<6-24,LANIE>但外缘的多边形膛线
<6-24,LANIE>but this polygonal rifling along the outer rim

192
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,350
<6-24,LANIE>与格洛克手枪吻合
<6-24,LANIE>is consistent with the barrel of a Glock.

193
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,180
<6-26,LANIE>-怎么了  -这组枪击
<6-26,LANIE>- What?  - The grouping of the shots.

194
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,210
<6-27,CASTLE>发现伤口都很紧致了吗
<6-27,CASTLE>You see how tight they all are?

195
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,810
<6-28,BECKETT>没有斑点烧痕和枪口烧伤
<6-28,BECKETT>There's no stippling, no muzzle burns.

197
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,480
<6-28,BECKETT>一定是远距离射击
<6-28,BECKETT>The killer must have shot from a distance.

198
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,720
<6-29,CASTLE>也就是说  他枪法很准
<6-29,CASTLE>Which means he's a very good shot.

199
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,080
<6-30,BECKETT>很好  谢谢
<6-30,BECKETT>Great. Thanks.

200
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,080

<7-2,CASTLE>Oh, I hope they got the insurance option.

204
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,920
<7-3,BECKETT>这车租给谁了
<7-3,BECKETT>Who did they rent it to?

<7-6,CASTLE>Do they know they rented their car to a company that doesn't exist?

208
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,840
<7-7,ESPOSITO>不  这公司存在  不在纽约而已
<7-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, no. It exists, just not in New York.

209
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,760
<7-7,ESPOSITO>所有的信函  账单和工资
<7-7,ESPOSITO>All correspondence, billing and payments go through

210
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,830
<7-7,ESPOSITO>都经由一个位于开曼群岛的邮箱
<7-7,ESPOSITO>a P.O Box in the Cayman Islands.

211
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,690
<7-8,RYAN>这案子越来越诡异了  在车尾箱找到这个
<7-8,RYAN>It gets even weirder. In the trunk, we found these.

<7-22,BECKETT>Well, now we know why our victim doesn't exist.

228
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,350
<7-22,BECKETT>他是个间谍
<7-22,BECKETT>He's a spy.

229
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,050
<8-1,BECKETT>我们联系了中情局  联邦调查局
<8-1,BECKETT>We contacted the CIA, the FBI,

<8-1,BECKETT>So far, all of them are denying that he was one of theirs.

232
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,790
<8-2,CASTLE>他们当然会否认
<8-2,CASTLE>Well, of course they're gonna deny it.

233
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,150
<8-2,CASTLE>他可能从被杀的那刻起就被除名了
<8-2,CASTLE>He was probably disavowed the moment he was killed,

234
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,510
<8-2,CASTLE>使这案子史无前例的酷
<8-2,CASTLE>making this officially the coolest case ever.

235
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,850
<8-3,BECKETT>我们要怎么做  长官
<8-3,BECKETT>So what do you want us to do, sir?

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,330
<16-9,BECKETT>太好了  "没人"会取笑我了
<16-9,BECKETT>That's great. No one's gonna make fun of me.

446
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,730
<16-9,BECKETT>还好
<16-9,BECKETT>Good.

447
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,280
<17-1,LIZ FENN>这是罗杰·法瑞戴
<17-1,LIZ FENN>That's Roger Farraday.

448
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,040
<17-1,LIZ FENN>他报名了一个四天的秘密游戏任务
<17-1,LIZ FENN>He was on the 4-day covert ops package,

449
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,020
<17-1,LIZ FENN>执行一项对联合国大使
<17-1,LIZ FENN>culminating in a staged assassination

450
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,710
<17-2,BECKETT>-的暗杀任务  -康涅狄格州  斯坦福市
<17-2,BECKETT>- of a U.N. Diplomat. - Stamford, Connecticut.

451
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,570
<17-2,BECKETT>他把他妻子梅琳达列为紧急联络人
<17-2,BECKETT>He lists his wife Melinda as his emergency contact.

452
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,920
<17-3,JASON FENN>探长  我们...对造成的误会深表歉意
<17-3,JASON FENN>Detective. We're--we're very sorry about the confusion.

453
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,610
<17-3,JASON FENN>一收到你们的讯息我们就联络警局了
<17-3,JASON FENN>We called as soon as we got your messages.

454
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,750
<17-4,CASTLE>假的身份证明和开曼群岛
<17-4,CASTLE>So the fake IDs, the Cayman Islands--

455
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,280
<17-5,JASON FENN>是的  是体验的一部分
<17-5,JASON FENN>Yeah, they're all part of the experience.

456
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,370
<17-6,LIZ FENN>你们绝对想不到
<17-6,LIZ FENN>You have no idea how excited people get

457
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,720
<17-6,LIZ FENN>他们必须用海外账户
<17-6,LIZ FENN>when they have to

458
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,540
<17-6,LIZ FENN>交款时是多么的兴奋
<17-6,LIZ FENN>wire their payment to an offshore account.

459
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,420
<17-7,CASTLE>你们的口号是"真实"
<17-7,CASTLE>So your slogan is "Authenticity."

460
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,700
<17-7,CASTLE>有没有可能是你们的一位顾客太当真了
<17-7,CASTLE>Is it possible one of your other players took things too far?

461
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,330
<17-8,JASON FENN>卡塞尔先生
<17-8,JASON FENN>Mr. Castle, uh,

462
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,880
<17-8,JASON FENN>我们非常重视客户的安全
<17-8,JASON FENN>we take the safety of our guests very seriously.

463
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,290
<17-8,JASON FENN>虽然我们的武器以假乱真  但都合法且不能改装
<17-8,JASON FENN>Our weapons look real, but their legal, inoperable

464
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,670
<17-8,JASON FENN>并只能用于游戏
<17-8,JASON FENN>and rigged for game play.

465
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,270
<17-8,JASON FENN>所以如果其中一个客户杀了罗杰
<17-8,JASON FENN>So if one of the guests killed Roger,

466
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,010
<17-8,JASON FENN>他们一定用的自己的武器  不是我们的
<17-8,JASON FENN>They used their own weapon, not ours.

467
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,120
<17-9,CASTLE>武器是假的  但钱是真的
<17-9,CASTLE>So the weapons are fake, but the money is real?

468
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,240
<17-10,LIZ FENN>什么钱
<17-10,LIZ FENN>What money?

469
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,620
<17-11,CASTLE>车里发现的五千欧元
<17-11,CASTLE>The 5,000 euros we found in the car.

470
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,750
<17-12,JASON FENN>我们有时会有金钱交易
<17-12,JASON FENN>Uh... yeah, we--we do money drops sometimes,

471
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,130
<17-12,JASON FENN>但从不会用真钱
<17-12,JASON FENN>but never with real currency.

472
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,900
<17-13,LIZ FENN>那会比他订的服务花的钱还多
<17-13,LIZ FENN>That's more than he paid for his package.

473
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,760
<17-13,LIZ FENN>-确定是真钱吗  -是的
<17-13,LIZ FENN>- Are you sure it was real?  - Positive.

474
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,510
<17-14,BECKETT>那天晚上法瑞戴先生在公园做什么
<17-14,BECKETT>What was Mr. Farraday doing in the park that night?

475
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,490
<17-14,BECKETT>-任务的一部分吗  -不  不是
<17-14,BECKETT>- Was that a part of a mission?  - No, no, no.

476
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,240
<17-15,JASON FENN>公园里晚上做任务过于危险
<17-15,JASON FENN>The park is too dangerous to work at night.

477
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,340
<17-15,JASON FENN>他最后的任务应该死前几小时就结束了
<17-15,JASON FENN>And his last mission should've ended hours earlier.

478
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,440
<17-16,CASTLE>最后的任务是什么
<17-16,CASTLE>What was his last mission?

479
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,570
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>法瑞戴吗  对  我是他的管理员
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>Farraday? Yeah. I was his handler.

480
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,170
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>那天他最后的任务是公交站储物柜提取情报
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>His last mission that day was the bus locker drop.

481
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,230
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>十点时我检查过  空的
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>I checked it at 10:00. It was empty.

482
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,510
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>所以我们知道他拿到了那支笔
<18-1,HUGO MORRISON>So we know he picked up the pen.

483
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,180
<18-2,CASTLE>-有录音的那支笔  -是的
<18-2,CASTLE>- The one with the recording?  - Yeah.

484
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,730
<18-3,HUGO MORRISON>他昨天的任务是咖啡馆会面
<18-3,HUGO MORRISON>His next activity was the cafe meet yesterday.

485
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,710
<18-4,BECKETT>十点到午夜  他去哪里了呢
<18-4,BECKETT>So where did he go between 10:00 and midnight?

486
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,990
<18-5,CASTLE>他又是怎么带着五千欧元
<18-5,CASTLE>And how did he end up in the park

487
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,390
<18-5,CASTLE>跑到公园的呢
<18-5,CASTLE>with 5,000 euros in his car?

488
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
<18-6,JASON FENN>他最后不是要做一个队友协作任务吗
<18-6,JASON FENN>Wasn't his last drop an accomplice mission?

489
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,750
<18-7,BECKETT>队友协作任务
<18-7,BECKETT>An accomplice mission?

490
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,990
<18-8,LIZ FENN>有时  需要玩家一起完成任务
<18-8,LIZ FENN>Well, sometimes we have players do tasks together,

491
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,810
<18-8,LIZ FENN>而且不知道对方是友是敌
<18-8,LIZ FENN>not knowing if the other is friend or foe.

492
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,040
<18-9,JASON FENN>他和代号145一起行动  法国特工
<18-9,JASON FENN>He was paired with designate 145, French Intelligence.

493
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,090
<18-10,LIZ FENN>安德莉亚·费舍尔  如果她和他在一起
<18-10,LIZ FENN>Andrea Fisher. If she was with him,

494
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,880
<18-10,LIZ FENN>也许她知道他接着去哪里了
<18-10,LIZ FENN>maybe she knows where he went next.

495
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,690
<18-11,BECKETT>认出她了吗
<18-11,BECKETT>Recognize her?

496
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,470
<18-12,CASTLE>当然
<18-12,CASTLE>Mais oui.

497
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,260
<19-1,ANDREA FISHER>老天  你们一定觉得我在咖啡馆的举动
<19-1,ANDREA FISHER>Oh, god. You both must think I'm so stupid,

498
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,630
<19-1,ANDREA FISHER>非常蠢
<19-1,ANDREA FISHER>the way that I acted in the cafe.

499
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,530
<19-2,CASTLE>只是游戏的一部分嘛
<19-2,CASTLE>All part of the game.

500
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,600
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>送给自己的假期  这是他们的口号
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>It's a vacation from yourself. That's what they say.

501
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>别误会
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>I mean, don't get me wrong. You know,

502
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,050
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>我爱我丈夫和孩子
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>I-I love my husband and my kids, but--

503
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,940
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>但每次普通度假  我依然是位母亲和妻子
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>but every time I go away, I'm-- I'm still a mom and a wife.

504
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,060
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>我丈夫说"如果你自己买单  就可以去"
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>My husband said, "If you can pay for it, you can go."

505
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,470
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>剪优惠券费神  但省下了不少生活费
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>So it took a lot of coupon clipping,

506
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,580
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>我终于当上了间谍
<19-3,ANDREA FISHER>but I got to be a spy.

507
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,030
<19-4,BECKETT>你和被害人很熟吗
<19-4,BECKETT>Our victim... how well did you know him?

508

<19-5,ANDREA FISHER>我们曾经一起执行了几个任务
<19-5,ANDREA FISHER>We... had a couple of tasks together,

509
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,420
<19-5,ANDREA FISHER>但我们都是在扮演角色
<19-5,ANDREA FISHER>but--but we were always playing roles.

510
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,910
<19-6,BECKETT>公车站任务时  你和法瑞戴先生一起吗

<19-11,ANDREA FISHER>我没有拿到  我就以为是他的额外任务
<19-11,ANDREA FISHER>I-I didn't get one, so I assumed it was a bonus mission.

518

<22-4,BECKETT>Eight years, Detective.

545
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,640
<22-4,BECKETT>我们已经结婚八年了
<22-4,BECKETT>We were married for eight years.

546
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,010
<22-4,BECKETT>现在他死了
<22-4,BECKETT>And now he's dead?

547
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,790
<23-1,BECKETT>通常情况如果遭遇
<23-1,BECKETT>You know, it used to be

548
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,680
<23-1,BECKETT>中年危机
<23-1,BECKETT>if you were gonna have a midlife crisis,

549
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,780
<23-1,BECKETT>你会买一辆法拉利  找个新女友
<23-1,BECKETT>You'd just buy a Ferrari, get a new girlfriend,

550
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,510
<23-1,BECKETT>甚至去跳伞
<23-1,BECKETT>even jump out of a plane.

551
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,110
<23-2,CASTLE>在公园里被枪杀  钱留在车上
<23-2,CASTLE>Shot in the park, money in his car--

552
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,880
<23-2,CASTLE>让你好奇他还干了什么来自娱自乐
<23-2,CASTLE>makes you wonder what else he did to get his jollies.

553
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,250
<23-3,BECKETT>现在我们知道他的真正身份
<23-3,BECKETT>Now that we know who he really is,

554
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,260
<23-3,BECKETT>我已经让埃斯波西托查他的财产情况
<23-3,BECKETT>I've asked Esposito to look into his financials.

555
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,300
<23-3,BECKETT>也许我们可以发现赤字红旗
<23-3,BECKETT>Maybe we'll see a red flag somewhere.

556
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,510
<23-4,CASTLE>说到红旗
<23-4,CASTLE>Oh, speaking of red flags.

557
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,690
<23-4,CASTLE>你好  戴明
<23-4,CASTLE>Hey, Demming.

558
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,850
<23-5,DEMMING>你好  卡塞尔
<23-5,DEMMING>Hey, Castle.

559
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,820
<23-5,DEMMING>记得我跟你说过
<23-5,DEMMING>So you know that little place

560
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,330
<23-5,DEMMING>在阿斯伯利的那个地方
<23-5,DEMMING>in Asbury I was telling you about,

561
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,640
<23-5,DEMMING>就在我们的沙滩小屋的转角处
<23-5,DEMMING>around the corner from our beach house?

562
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,260
<23-7,DEMMING>他们刚好在周五有空房
<23-7,DEMMING>Well, they just had a reservation open up on friday.

563
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,600
<23-7,DEMMING>如果我们早点离开  可能赶得上
<23-7,DEMMING>If we leave early enough, we could probably make it.

564
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,140
<23-8,BECKETT>让我看看有没有时间  好吗
<23-8,BECKETT>Yeah, um... will you let me check into it?

565
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,900
<23-9,DEMMING>好的  稍后见
<23-9,DEMMING>Great. I'll see you later.

566
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,300
<23-10,CASTLE>沙滩小屋
<23-10,CASTLE>Beach house?

567
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,650
<23-10,CASTLE>原以为你周末工作
<23-10,CASTLE>Thought you were working this weekend.

568
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,950
<23-11,BECKETT>很抱歉  卡塞尔  我应该告诉你的
<23-11,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm sorry, Castle. I shoulda just told you.

569
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,150
<23-11,BECKETT>我只是不想因为汤姆和我在一起
<23-11,BECKETT>I just didn't want things to be... awkward between us

570
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,200
<23-11,BECKETT>让我们之间变得尴尬
<23-11,BECKETT>now that Tom and I are... together.

571
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,290
<23-12,CASTLE>不会  我明白
<23-12,CASTLE>No, I get it. Yeah.

572
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,620
<23-12,CASTLE>你只是想让你的私生活私密一些
<23-12,CASTLE>No, you want your private life to be private.

573
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,370
<23-13,BECKETT>是的  我只是不想大家
<23-13,BECKETT>Yeah, I-I just don't-- I don't want anyone

574
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,620
<23-13,BECKETT>感到不自在
<23-13,BECKETT>to feel uncomfortable.

575
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,050
<23-14,CASTLE>当然不会  我是说
<23-14,CASTLE>No, of course not. No, I mean...

576
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,170
<23-14,CASTLE>这样让我要说的话更容易说出口
<23-14,CASTLE>actually, that makes what I was gonna say a little easier.

577
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,870
<23-14,CASTLE>因为我的书期  我在想
<23-14,CASTLE>Um... well, with my book due, I was thinking

578
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,580
<23-14,CASTLE>现在是我们休息一下的好时间
<23-14,CASTLE>it'd be a good time for us to take a break.

579
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,220
<23-15,BECKETT>-休息  -是啊
<23-15,BECKETT>- A break?  - Yeah. Well, god knows,

580
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,000
<23-16,CASTLE>你肯定厌倦我天天围着你转
<23-16,CASTLE>you gotta be tired of me following you around all the time,

581
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,150
<23-16,CASTLE>而我也真的需要好好写写书了
<23-16,CASTLE>and I really do need to get some work done.

582
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,660
<23-16,CASTLE>我老妈和女儿都各有安排  我就想
<23-16,CASTLE>With everyone gone, I figure, why not just

583
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,000
<23-16,CASTLE>我为何不留在汉普顿
<23-16,CASTLE>stay up in the Hamptons, you know?

584
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,370
<23-17,BECKETT>-暂时远离城市  -要去多久呢
<23-17,BECKETT>- Get away from the city for a while.  - Well, for how long?

585
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,290
<23-18,CASTLE>至少这个夏天
<23-18,CASTLE>The summer at least.

586
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,980
<23-18,CASTLE>我想这会是我们最后一件案子
<23-18,CASTLE>I thought this would be our last case.

587
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,180
<23-19,RYAN>嘿  我们
<23-19,RYAN>Hey. So, uh, we...

588
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,540
<23-20,ESPOSITO>-没事吧  -好极了
<23-20,ESPOSITO>- Everything okay?  - Great.

589
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,850
<23-22,BECKETT>是的  很好  你们有什么发现
<23-22,BECKETT>Yeah, fine. Uh, what'd you guys find?

590
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,820
<23-23,RYAN>公车站储物柜的监控录像
<23-23,RYAN>Surveillance stills from the bus locker.

591
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,320
<23-23,RYAN>那个长岛家庭主妇是对的
<23-23,RYAN>Your long island housewife was right.

592
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,050
<23-23,RYAN>罗杰在晚上将近10点的时候
<23-23,RYAN>Roger picked up the briefcase from locker 27-B

593
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,740
<23-23,RYAN>-从储物柜27-B拿了公文包  -很好
<23-23,RYAN>- shortly before 10:00 P.M.  - Great.

594
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,810
<23-25,ESPOSITO>你不想知道谁放的吗
<23-25,ESPOSITO>You don't want to know who put it in there?

595
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,220
<23-26,BECKETT>想知道  抱歉
<23-26,BECKETT>Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah.

596
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,250
<23-27,CASTLE>那是间谍大冒险里罗杰的管理员
<23-27,CASTLE>That's Roger's handler from Spy-Ventures.

597
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,420
<23-27,CASTLE>他说这公文包不是游戏的一部分
<23-27,CASTLE>He said the briefcase wasn't part of the game,

598
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,360
<23-27,CASTLE>那为什么他要把公文包放进罗杰的储物柜呢
<23-27,CASTLE>so why is he putting it in Roger's locker?

599
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,930
<23-28,BECKETT>-他为什么说谎  -就是啊
<23-28,BECKETT>- And why did he lie?  - Exactly.

600
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,450
<24-1,BECKETT>公文包里有什么  雨果
<24-1,BECKETT>What was in the briefcase, Hugo?

601
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,290
<24-2,CASTLE>我们和你的老板谈过  雨果
<24-2,CASTLE>We talked to your bosses, Hugo.

602
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,530
<24-2,CASTLE>我们知道这不是游戏的一部分
<24-2,CASTLE>We know it wasn't part of the game.

603
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,290
<24-3,BECKETT>但你却让一位玩家
<24-3,BECKETT>And yet, you had one of your players

604
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,510
<24-3,BECKETT>去取公文包然后替你运送
<24-3,BECKETT>pick it up and deliver it for you.

605
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,380
<24-3,BECKETT>结果他死了
<24-3,BECKETT>And he just happened to end up dead.

606
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,900
<24-5,BECKETT>-我不知道  -你不知道什么
<24-5,BECKETT>- I didn't know.  - You didn't know what?

607
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,430
<24-6,HUGO MORRISON>原本没人会受伤的  我...
<24-6,HUGO MORRISON>Look, no one was supposed to get hurt. I just...

608
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,970
<24-6,HUGO MORRISON>我需要一个人去做交易
<24-6,HUGO MORRISON>I needed someone to make the exchange.

609
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,760
<24-7,CASTLE>公文包里有什么  雨果  毒品还是钱
<24-7,CASTLE>What was in the briefcase, Hugo, drugs, money?

610
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,890
<24-8,HUGO MORRISON>-身份证明  -身份证明
<24-8,HUGO MORRISON>- IDs.  - IDs?

611
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,030
<24-9,BECKETT>我工作涉及制作身份道具
<24-9,BECKETT>Part of my job is to make the ID kits--

612
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,820
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>公司徽章  虚拟国家的护照
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>corporate badges, passports from nonexistent countries.

613
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,990
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>但利用杰森的设备  你也可以伪造
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>But with Jason's equipment, you can forge counterfeit IDs

614
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,050
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>真实国家的身份证明
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>for real countries, too.

615
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,550
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>但那是非法的
<24-10,HUGO MORRISON>But it's illegal.

616
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,120
<24-11,CASTLE>那也没有阻止你  对吧
<24-11,CASTLE>But that didn't stop you, did it?

617
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,250
<24-12,BECKETT>那你都卖给谁
<24-12,BECKETT>So who did you sell to?

618
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,250
<24-13,HUGO MORRISON>大学学生  大多数是想去买啤酒
<24-13,HUGO MORRISON>College kids, mostly looking to buy beer.

619
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,310
<24-14,CASTLE>然后你利用玩家完成交易
<24-14,CASTLE>And then you used game players to make the drops.

620
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,980
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>这样就算有人被抓了  也无法指认我
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>So if anybody got busted, they couldn't identify me.

621
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,320
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>他们只是一群大学生
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>I mean, these are college kids.

622
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,170
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>就算他们被抓了还可以向祖母求情
<24-15,HUGO MORRISON>They'd roll over on their grandmothers if they got caught.

623
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,830
<24-16,BECKETT>直觉告诉我  罗杰不是被
<24-16,BECKETT>Well, something tells me that Roger wasn't killed

624
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,060
<24-16,BECKETT>一群未成年的大学生杀死的
<24-16,BECKETT>by a group of underaged college kids.

625
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,030
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>最后这次的工作有些不同
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>No, this last job, it was different.

626
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,800
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>我知道我不该接的
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>I knew I shouldn't have taken it,

627
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,390
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>-但他们出价很高  -谁
<24-17,HUGO MORRISON>- but they were paying so much money. - Who?

628
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,130
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>他们是乌克兰人  从网上找到我
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>They're Ukrainians. They found me on the internet.

629
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,470
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>他们急需护照
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>They said they needed passports.

630
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,580
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>我安排了罗杰去交易  取钱
<24-19,HUGO MORRISON>I sent Roger to make the drop and pick up the money.

631
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,420
<24-20,CASTLE>五千欧元
<24-20,CASTLE>5,000 euros.

632
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,740
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>他以为这只是另一个任务
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>He thought it was just another mission.

633
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,810
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>不过之后肯定是出了问题
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>But something must have gone wrong.

634
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,220
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>交易完成之后  他打热线找我
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>After he made the drop, he called me on the hotline,

635
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,200
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>说他被一辆黑色轿车跟踪
<24-21,HUGO MORRISON>said he was being followed by a dark sedan.

636
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,930
<24-22,BECKETT>一辆黑色轿车  当时是几点
<24-22,BECKETT>A dark sedan? And what time was this?

637
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,460
<24-22,BECKETT>11:30左右
<24-22,BECKETT>11:30-ish.

638
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,300
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>听着  玩这个游戏会让人产生妄想
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>Look, playing the game, it makes you paranoid.

639
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,350
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>我当时以为一切都是他的幻觉
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>So I just--I figured it was just his imagination.

640
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,520
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>所以我闪烁其词的答复了他
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>So I gave him the standard line about evasive maneuvers.

641
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,350
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>我不知道他真的被跟踪了
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>I didn't really think he was being followed.

642
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,760
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>没想到是真的
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>But he was.

643
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,330
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>接近半夜时他再次打来
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>He called again close to midnight

644
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,850
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>说他的身份暴露了
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>and said his cover had been blown.

645
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,640
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>我以为他在开我玩笑  就没理他
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>I thought he was messing with me, so I shined him on.

646
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,490
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>我把他撂在一边  结果害死了他
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>I shined him on, and now he's dead.

647
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,680
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>我一定是做错了什么
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>I must have done something wrong.

648
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,970
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>一定是弄混了护照或是...
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>I must have messed up the passports or s--

649
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,800
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>所以他们才会找上他  杀他灭口
<24-23,HUGO MORRISON>and they came after him and they killed him.

650
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,520
<24-24,BECKETT>那个公文包  他送去哪里了
<24-24,BECKETT>The briefcase-- where did he deliver it to?

651
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,820
<24-24,BECKETT>雨果  我需要那些乌克兰人的地址
<24-24,BECKETT>Hugo, the Ukrainians, I need an address now.

652
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:20,860
<25-1,RYAN>安全
<25-1,RYAN>Clear!

653
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,390
<25-1,RYAN>安全
<25-1,RYAN>Clear!

654
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,010
<25-2,ESPOSITO>让他们转身
<25-2,ESPOSITO>Turn 'em around!

655
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,930
<25-2,ESPOSITO>都给我站好  不要动
<25-2,ESPOSITO>Get up there, now! Stay there! Stay there!

656
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,360
<25-3,RYAN>是群孩子
<25-3,RYAN>They're kids.

657
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:43,450
<26-1,ESPOSITO>他们是乌克兰人  但只是学生
<26-1,ESPOSITO>Yep. They're Ukrainians, but they're students.

658
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,000
<26-1,ESPOSITO>他们在自己国家可以喝酒
<26-1,ESPOSITO>They're used to being able to drink back home,

659
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,950
<26-1,ESPOSITO>但在这里他们需要假的身份证才能买到酒
<26-1,ESPOSITO>but they needed fake IDs to buy booze here.

660
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,520
<26-1,ESPOSITO>他们在参与暑期项目的同学那
<26-1,ESPOSITO>They got Hugo's information from another kid

661
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,140
<26-2,CASTLE>-得知雨果的信息  -暑期项目
<26-2,CASTLE>- in the summer program. - Summer program?

662
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,670
<26-3,ESPOSITO>他们是哈德森大学暑期交换项目的
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they're part of the summer exchange program

663
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,630
<26-3,ESPOSITO>-交换生  怎么了  -没什么
<26-3,ESPOSITO>- at Hudson University. Why? - No reason.

664
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,240
<26-5,ESPOSITO>总之  他们都没有黑色轿车
<26-5,ESPOSITO>Anyway, none of them own a dark sedan,

665
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,640
<26-5,ESPOSITO>而且看起来罗杰刚把假身份证交给他们
<26-5,ESPOSITO>and seeing as how they all went out partying

666
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,020
<26-5,ESPOSITO>他们就都去参加派对了
<26-5,ESPOSITO>the moment Roger dropped off the IDs,

667
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,220
<26-5,ESPOSITO>我想他们都不是凶手
<26-5,ESPOSITO>it's doubtful any of them are our killer.

668
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,600
<26-7,CASTLE>你真的认为他被跟踪了吗
<26-7,CASTLE>You actually think he was being followed?

669
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,660
<26-8,BECKETT>11:30打电话  不久后他就中枪了
<26-8,BECKETT>Well, he calls at 11:30 and then just before he's shot.

670
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,430
<26-8,BECKETT>车子坏了  他徒步跑进公园
<26-8,BECKETT>His car is damaged. He runs on foot into the park.

671
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,470
<26-8,BECKETT>感觉上他是想找一个藏身之处
<26-8,BECKETT>Sounds to me like he was running away.

672
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,880
<26-8,BECKETT>问题是躲谁呢
<26-8,BECKETT>But from whom?

673
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,280
<26-9,CASTLE>虽然我也很想帮你
<26-9,CASTLE>Well, as much as I'd like to help you run down

674
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,490
<26-9,CASTLE>查遍本市所有的黑色轿车
<26-9,CASTLE>every dark sedan in the city,

675
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,480
<26-9,CASTLE>但我要主持一场扑克游戏
<26-9,CASTLE>I have a poker game to host.

676
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,230
<26-9,CASTLE>明早见
<26-9,CASTLE>See you in the morning.

677
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,270
<26-10,BECKETT>再见
<26-10,BECKETT>See ya.

678
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,690
<26-11,ESPOSITO>这是卡塞尔的最后一案
<26-11,ESPOSITO>So... Castle's last case, huh?

679
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,360
<26-13,ESPOSITO>我和莱恩想为他办场小型欢送会
<26-13,ESPOSITO>Ryan and I thought we'd do a little going away party.

680
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,390
<26-14,BECKETT>他又不是一去不返
<26-14,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, it's not like he's leaving forever.

681
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,260
<26-14,BECKETT>你真这么想吗
<26-14,BECKETT>You sure about that?

682
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,990
<26-15,ESPOSITO>他一直围着你转是为了什么
<26-15,ESPOSITO>Why do you think he's been following you around all this time?

683
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,660
<26-15,ESPOSITO>为了做调查吗
<26-15,ESPOSITO>What, research?

684
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,850
<26-15,ESPOSITO>他的调查够他写五十本书
<26-15,ESPOSITO>The guy has done enough research to write 50 books.

685
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,150
<26-15,ESPOSITO>听着  不管理由是什么  我敢肯定
<26-15,ESPOSITO>Look... whatever the reason is, I'm pretty sure

686
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,660
<26-15,ESPOSITO>当中不包括看着你和别的男人在一起
<26-15,ESPOSITO>it doesn't include watching you be with another guy.

687
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,990
<26-15,ESPOSITO>间谍游戏中发生谋杀案
<26-15,ESPOSITO>A murder in the middle of a spy game

688
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,170
<26-15,ESPOSITO>没人知道来龙去脉
<26-15,ESPOSITO>where nobody knows what's going on?

689
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,600
<26-15,ESPOSITO>合我口味
<26-15,ESPOSITO>I like that.

690
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
<27-1,MICHAEL CONNELLY>乌克兰人是一个很妙的转折
<27-1,MICHAEL CONNELLY>The Ukrainians are a nice twist.

691
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,850
<27-2,CASTLE>现在赃银
<27-2,CASTLE>So we've explained the money,

692
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,360
<27-2,CASTLE>小玩意和公文包都解释得通
<27-2,CASTLE>the gadgets and the briefcase.

693
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,140
<27-2,CASTLE>唯一解释不通的是  他为何被杀
<27-2,CASTLE>The only thing we can't explain--why was he killed?

694
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,610
<27-3,JAMES PATTERSON>或许是你们查错方向了
<27-3,JAMES PATTERSON>Maybe that's because you're looking in the wrong place.

695
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,640
<27-4,CASTLE>帕特森  那你会从哪方面去查
<27-4,CASTLE>All right, Patterson. Where would you look?

696
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>如果我是作者
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>If I was writing this,

697
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,880
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>谋杀案和间谍游戏其实完全无关
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>the murder would have nothing to do with the spy game

698
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,910
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>实际上游戏本身为凶手提供了行凶的机会
<27-5,JAMES PATTERSON>except that it gave the killer an opportunity to act.

699
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,350
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>因为游戏情节能完美掩藏他的行踪
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>Knowing that the trappings of the game would cover his tracks.

700
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,680
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>大概就是这套路
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>Which is pretty much what's happened.

701
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,570
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>里克  不管我们多费心去构思小说
<27-6,MICHAEL CONNELLY>Look, Rick, as much trouble as we go to with these novels,

702
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,050
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>能使人杀人  就只有三种原因
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>there's only three reasons to commit a murder--

703
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,120
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>-爱情  金钱和掩盖罪行  -科奈尔说得对
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>- Love, money and to cover up a crime. - Cannell's right.

704
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,900
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>我会花更多时间调查被害人
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>I'd spend more time looking at your victim

705
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,340
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>而不是调查这个游戏
<27-7,MICHAEL CONNELLY>and less time looking at the game.

706
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,080
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>个人而言  我会多花点时间写作
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>Personally, I'd spend more time writing

707
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,220
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>而不是跟着警察朋友东奔西跑
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>and less time hanging out with your cop friend.

708
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,670
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>里奇  说真的  一年只出一本书
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>I mean, really, Ricky, just one book a year?

709
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,980
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>里克  真有点少
<27-8,JAMES PATTERSON>Kinda thin, Rick.

710
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,310
<27-9,JAMES PATTERSON>比起为你提供灵感  她更能让你分心
<27-9,JAMES PATTERSON>She seems like more of a distraction than a muse.

711
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,360
<27-10,CASTLE>你们说得对
<27-10,CASTLE>No, you're right.

712
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,000
<27-10,CASTLE>我想我从这段关系中
<27-10,CASTLE>I think I've gotten everything I can get

713
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,170
<27-10,CASTLE>已经得到了我想要的一切
<27-10,CASTLE>out of that relationship anyway.

714
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,420
<28-1,DEMMING>可以走了吗
<28-1,DEMMING>Hey. You ready?

715
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,860
<29-1,BECKETT>-早  -早
<29-1,BECKETT>- Hey. - Hey.

716
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,170
<29-2,CASTLE>我刚刚在想...
<29-2,CASTLE>I was just thinking...

717
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,470
<29-3,CASTLE>-可以坐下吗  -坐吧
<29-3,CASTLE>- May-- - Yeah.

718
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,590
<29-4,BECKETT>我一直在想
<29-4,BECKETT>I've been thinking...

719
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,630
<29-5,CASTLE>我们可能查错方向了
<29-5,CASTLE>maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

720
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,860
<29-6,CASTLE>谋杀案可能和游戏完全无关
<29-6,CASTLE>Maybe the murder has nothing to do with the game.

721
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,540
<29-6,CASTLE>游戏只是为凶手提供了一个行凶的机会
<29-6,CASTLE>Maybe it just afforded the killer an opportunity to act.

722
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,780
<29-6,CASTLE>真是太巧了
<29-6,CASTLE>That's so f-funny,

723
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,010
<29-7,BECKETT>因为今天一早起来
<29-7,BECKETT>because I was thinking the same thing

724
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,290
<29-7,BECKETT>我也一直在想这事
<29-7,BECKETT>when I woke up this morning,

725
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,210
<29-7,BECKETT>可能我们过于关注游戏这条线
<29-7,BECKETT>that maybe we got so caught up in the game

726
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,880
<29-7,BECKETT>而忽略了至关重要的线索
<29-7,BECKETT>that we stopped looking at what really mattered.

727
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,930
<29-8,CASTLE>被害人
<29-8,CASTLE>The victim.

728
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,290
<29-9,BECKETT>正是  看看这个
<29-9,BECKETT>Exactly. So check this out.

729
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,120
<29-9,BECKETT>他的财政状况很正常
<29-9,BECKETT>His financials came back clean.

730
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,850
<29-9,BECKETT>后来我们调查了
<29-9,BECKETT>But then we did a search on

731
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,420
<29-9,BECKETT>他的合伙人李·科普里
<29-9,BECKETT>his business partner, Lee Copley,

732
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,670
<29-9,BECKETT>发现他两个月前申请了破产
<29-9,BECKETT>and it turns out that he filed for bankruptcy two months

733
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,330
<29-9,BECKETT>他以房地产抵押也还不清
<29-9,BECKETT>ago overextended himself in real estate.

734
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,630
<29-10,CASTLE>我猜猜  若罗杰死了
<29-10,CASTLE>Let me guess, if Roger dies,

735
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,290
<29-10,CASTLE>他拥有的那一半公司财产就归科普里了
<29-10,CASTLE>his half of the business goes to Copley.

736
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,390
<29-11,BECKETT>价值超过五十万美元
<29-11,BECKETT>Over half a million dollars worth.

737
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,160
<29-12,CASTLE>他妻子说过  知道罗杰在市区的
<29-12,CASTLE>His wife did say, the only two people who knew

738
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,570
<29-12,CASTLE>就她和科普里两个人
<29-12,CASTLE>Roger was in the city were her and Copley.

739
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,830
<29-13,BECKETT>猜猜科普里开的什么车
<29-13,BECKETT>And guess what Copley drives.

740
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,470
<29-14,CASTLE>黑色轿车
<29-14,CASTLE>A dark Sedan?

741
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,370
<30-1,LEE COPLEY>罗杰是我的朋友  我们一起长大
<30-1,LEE COPLEY>Roger was my friend. We grew up together.

742
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,440
<30-1,LEE COPLEY>我为什么要杀他
<30-1,LEE COPLEY>Why would I kill him?

743
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,760
<30-2,CASTLE>我可以告诉你"五十万"个理由
<30-2,CASTLE>I can give you half a million reasons why.

744
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,650
<30-3,LEE COPLEY>怎么  就因为我面临财政问题吗
<30-3,LEE COPLEY>What, because I'm having financial problems?

745
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,340
<30-3,LEE COPLEY>就因为我们恰好一起做生意
<30-3,LEE COPLEY>Because we just happen to own a business together?

746
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,610
<30-4,CASTLE>因为贪婪  科普里先生  那是最单纯的动机
<30-4,CASTLE>Greed, Mr. Copley. It's the purest motive there is.

747
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,780
<30-5,LEE COPLEY>简直太荒谬了
<30-5,LEE COPLEY>Oh, this is ridiculous.

748
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,360
<30-6,BECKETT>罗杰·法瑞戴遇害那晚
<30-6,BECKETT>Where were you the night

749
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:13,880
<30-6,BECKETT>你在哪儿
<30-6,BECKETT>that Roger Farraday was murdered?

750
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,120
<30-7,LEE COPLEY>我在家睡觉
<30-7,LEE COPLEY>I was home in bed.

751
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,430
<30-8,BECKETT>是吗  那你能解释下这个吗
<30-8,BECKETT>Really? Then do you care to explain these?

752
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,820
<30-8,BECKETT>这些照片是那晚八点
<30-8,BECKETT>These are photos of you leaving your apartment garage

753
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,160
<30-8,BECKETT>你离开公寓车库时拍到的
<30-8,BECKETT>at 8:00 the night that he was murdered.

754
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,400
<30-8,BECKETT>而这些是你第二天早上七点
<30-8,BECKETT>And these are photos of you returning

755
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,520
<30-8,BECKETT>返回时的照片
<30-8,BECKETT>the following morning at 7:00 a.m.

756
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,850
<30-9,CASTLE>"在家睡觉"算是露馅了
<30-9,CASTLE>Kind of blows a hole in your whole "Home in bed" thing.

757
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,760
<30-10,BECKETT>你撒谎了  科普里先生
<30-10,BECKETT>You lied to me, Mr. Copley.

758
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,680
<30-10,BECKETT>想要更改你的证词吗
<30-10,BECKETT>Do you care to revise your statement?

759
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,520
<30-10,BECKETT>晚上八点  你有足够的时间
<30-10,BECKETT>8:00 p.m. That's plenty of time

760
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,790
<30-10,BECKETT>从斯坦福开车过来
<30-10,BECKETT>to drive to the city from Stamford.

761
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,060
<30-10,BECKETT>你干了些什么  李
<30-10,BECKETT>What did you do, Lee?

762
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,630
<30-11,CASTLE>在旅馆守候  跟踪  直到他落单
<30-11,CASTLE>Wait for him at the hotel, follow him till he was alone?

763
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,800
<30-13,BECKETT>-不  我没有  -然后拿游戏当幌子
<30-13,BECKETT>- No, I didn't.  - And then you used the game as cover.

764
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,880
<30-14,LEE COPLEY>不  听我说  我发誓  不是我干的
<30-14,LEE COPLEY>No. Look, I swear, I didn't do it.

765
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,970
<30-15,BECKETT>是啊  你"在家睡觉"呢
<30-15,BECKETT>Right. You were at home in bed.

766
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,080
<30-16,LEE COPLEY>不  我不在家  但我确实在睡觉
<30-16,LEE COPLEY>No, I wasn't... at home, but I was in bed...

767
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,000
<30-16,LEE COPLEY>和他老婆一起
<30-16,LEE COPLEY>With his wife.

768
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,260
<30-17,BECKETT>抱歉  你说什么
<30-17,BECKETT>I'm sorry. What?

769
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,060
<30-18,LEE COPLEY>我和罗杰的老婆睡在一起
<30-18,LEE COPLEY>I was in bed with Roger's wife.

770
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,320
<30-19,CASTLE>我再确认一下
<30-19,CASTLE>Let me-- let me get this straight.

771
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,540
<30-19,CASTLE>你的不在场证据是  你在和
<30-19,CASTLE>You-your alibi for killing your friend is you were

772
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,110
<30-19,CASTLE>朋友的老婆上床
<30-19,CASTLE>doing his-- his wife?

773
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,770
<30-19,CASTLE>是的
<30-19,CASTLE>Yeah.

774
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,760
<30-19,CASTLE>怎么  你想让我认错吗
<30-19,CASTLE>What? You want me to say I'm sorry?

775
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,230
<30-19,CASTLE>想让我觉得难堪吗  我才不会
<30-19,CASTLE>You want me to be embarrassed? I'm not.

776
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,480
<30-19,CASTLE>你知道我和罗杰有多久没做爱了吗
<30-19,CASTLE>Do you know how long it had been since Roger and I made love?

777
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,070
<30-19,CASTLE>他只关心工作和那个破游戏
<30-19,CASTLE>All he cared about was work and his extreme vacations.

778
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,180
<30-19,CASTLE>没错  我是在和李幽会
<30-19,CASTLE>So, yeah, I was seeing Lee.

779
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,270
<30-19,CASTLE>那晚我确实和他在一起
<30-19,CASTLE>Yeah, I was with him that night.

780
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,620
<31-1,BECKETT>既然婚姻那么糟糕  为什么不离婚呢
<31-1,BECKETT>Well, if things were that bad, why not just get a divorce?

781
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,200
<31-1,BECKETT>你说笑吧  我可舍不得我的房子
<31-1,BECKETT>Are you serious? My house is too nice.

782
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,560
<32-1,CASTLE>难怪罗杰要找点别的乐子了
<32-1,CASTLE>I can see why Roger needed a little extra fantasy in his life.

783
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,660
<32-2,ESPOSITO>我问过他妻子的邻居了
<32-2,ESPOSITO>I talked to the wife's neighbors.

784
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,190
<32-2,ESPOSITO>有几个人见到李的车
<32-2,ESPOSITO>A few of them remember Lee's car outside

785
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,100
<32-3,RYAN>-那晚停在她家外面  -那也不能说明什么啊
<32-3,RYAN>- the house that night.  - Well, that doesn't mean anything.

786
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,420
<32-3,RYAN>那家伙是个汽车经销商
<32-3,RYAN>The guy runs an auto dealership.

787
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,680
<32-3,RYAN>他可以中途换车
<32-3,RYAN>He could've just switched cars.

788
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,190
<32-4,ESPOSITO>没错  但那天晚上很热
<32-4,ESPOSITO>True, except it was a warm night,

789
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,260
<32-4,ESPOSITO>-热到必须开窗  -不会吧
<32-4,ESPOSITO>- Warm enough to leave the windows open.  - Oh, no.

790
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,540
<32-6,ESPOSITO>错不了  她隔壁的邻居清楚地记得
<32-6,ESPOSITO>Oh, yes. The next-door neighbor distinctly remembers

791
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,780
<32-6,ESPOSITO>听到从她卧室的窗户传来的
<32-6,ESPOSITO>hearing the sounds of loud, passionate lovemaking

792
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,220
<32-6,ESPOSITO>响亮而激情四溢的做爱声
<32-6,ESPOSITO>coming from the open bedroom window.

793
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,860
<32-6,ESPOSITO>-吵得他午夜后才睡着  -我不相信
<32-6,ESPOSITO>- Kept him up till well past midnight.  - I don't buy it.

794
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,590
<32-7,CASTLE>他们都有杀人动机
<32-7,CASTLE>They both had motive.

795
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,790
<32-7,CASTLE>他们有奸情
<32-7,CASTLE>They were having an affair.

796
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,500
<32-7,CASTLE>又知道被害者身在何处
<32-7,CASTLE>They knew exactly where he was.

797
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,780
<32-7,CASTLE>就算有不在场证明
<32-7,CASTLE>Just because they had an alibi

798
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,670
<32-7,CASTLE>也不能摆脱嫌疑
<32-7,CASTLE>does not mean they didn't do it.

799
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,990
<32-8,BECKETT>你觉得他们雇了个杀手吗
<32-8,BECKETT>Do you think they hired someone?

800
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,970
<32-9,CASTLE>职业杀手的手法都明摆着呢
<32-9,CASTLE>It had all the hallmarks of a professional hit.

801
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,740
<32-10,BECKETT>肯定不是李干的  除非破产法庭
<32-10,BECKETT>Well, it couldn't have been Lee unless he asked

802
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,750
<32-10,BECKETT>允许他雇一位职业杀手
<32-10,BECKETT>the bankruptcy court for permission to hire a hit man,

803
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,160
<32-10,BECKETT>那是不可能的
<32-10,BECKETT>And I don't think that's likely.

804
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,630
<32-11,RYAN>法瑞戴账户上唯一一笔异常支出
<32-11,RYAN>And the only unusual charge on the Farradays' account

805
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,430
<32-11,RYAN>是罗杰在开曼群岛
<32-11,RYAN>was the 10 grand that Roger wired to

806
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,710
<32-11,RYAN>转给间谍大冒险的1万美元
<32-11,RYAN>the Spy-Ventures account in the cayman islands.

807
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,320
<32-12,CASTLE>1万美元
<32-12,CASTLE>10 grand?

808
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,880
<32-13,RYAN>是啊  怎么啦
<32-13,RYAN>Yeah, why?

809
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,120
<32-14,CASTLE>他只需付一半左右的费用
<32-14,CASTLE>Because he only should've paid half that much.

810
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,520
<32-14,CASTLE>记得间谍大冒险那个女人对我们
<32-14,CASTLE>Do you remember what the woman at Spy-Ventures

811
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,750
<32-14,CASTLE>在车里找到钱是怎么说的吗
<32-14,CASTLE>said about the money we found in the car?

812
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,270
<32-15,BECKETT>记得  她说五千欧元比
<32-15,BECKETT>Yeah, that 5,000 euros was more than

813
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,250
<32-15,BECKETT>他付的整个游戏费用要多
<32-15,BECKETT>what he paid for his entire spy-cation.

814
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,590
<32-16,RYAN>他的银行账单显示他转了
<32-16,RYAN>His bank statement indicates he transferred

815
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,040
<32-16,RYAN>两笔五千美元的费用给那个公司
<32-16,RYAN>2 payments of 5 grand each to the game,

816
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,480
<32-16,RYAN>总共是一万美元
<32-16,RYAN>for a total of $10,000.

817
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,650
<32-17,CASTLE>是同时付款的
<32-17,CASTLE>The payments were made at the same time,

818
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,910
<32-17,CASTLE>像是付了两次
<32-17,CASTLE>almost like he paid twice.

819
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,410
<33-1,JASON FENN>若数据正确的话  他确实是付了两次款
<33-1,JASON FENN>If these numbers are correct, he did pay twice--

820
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,720
<33-1,JASON FENN>一次为自己  第二次为另一个玩家
<33-1,JASON FENN>Once for him, once for another player.

821
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,270
<33-2,BECKETT>另一个玩家
<33-2,BECKETT>Another player?

822
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,260
<33-3,CASTLE>那个玩家是谁
<33-3,CASTLE>Who was the other player?

823
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,290
<33-4,JASON FENN>安德莉亚·费舍尔
<33-4,JASON FENN>Andrea Fisher.

824
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,760
<33-5,CASTLE>长岛的那个主妇
<33-5,CASTLE>Our Long Island housewife?

825
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,220
<33-5,CASTLE>她说在组队玩游戏前
<33-5,CASTLE>She said she never met Roger

826
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,670
<33-5,CASTLE>从未见过罗杰
<33-5,CASTLE>until they were teamed up for the game.

827
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,700
<33-6,BECKETT>若从未见过  他为什么替她付钱呢
<33-6,BECKETT>Well, if they never met, why did he pay for her?

828
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,480
<34-1,ANDREA FISHER>肯定是搞错了
<34-1,ANDREA FISHER>There must be some mistake.

829
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,750
<34-2,BECKETT>我们和银行核对过了  费舍尔太太
<34-2,BECKETT>We checked with the bank, Mrs. Fisher.

830
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,900
<34-2,BECKETT>绝对没错
<34-2,BECKETT>There is no mistake.

831
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,950
<34-2,BECKETT>你没有向间谍大冒险付过款
<34-2,BECKETT>You never paid Spy-Ventures.

832
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,780
<34-3,CASTLE>是罗杰付的
<34-3,CASTLE>But Roger did.

833
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,240
<34-3,CASTLE>不过优惠券那个借口不错
<34-3,CASTLE>The coupon clipping was a nice touch, though.

834
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,440
<34-3,CASTLE>是用来糊弄你丈夫的吧
<34-3,CASTLE>I assume that was for your husband's benefit?

835
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,690
<34-4,BECKETT>你和罗杰·法瑞戴到底是什么关系
<34-4,BECKETT>What was the nature of your relationship with Roger Farraday?

836
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,450
<34-5,ANDREA FISHER>我们是
<34-5,ANDREA FISHER>We were, um...

837
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,200
<34-5,ANDREA FISHER>朋友
<34-5,ANDREA FISHER>friends.

838
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,980
<34-6,BECKETT>你们什么时候认识的
<34-6,BECKETT>When did the two of you first meet?

839
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,400
<34-6,BECKETT>去年
<34-6,BECKETT>Last year.

840
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,290
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>我带女儿谢尔比
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>I was, uh, I was taking my daughter Shelby

841
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,010
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>到市区去上舞蹈班
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>into, uh, the city for dance classes.

842
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,330
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>送完她后  我会去博物馆
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>After I dropped her off, I'd go to the museum.

843
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,070
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>每个星期  我都会看到他
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>Every week, I'd see him,

844
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,610
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>站在莫奈的《睡莲》前
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>standing in front of Monet's "Water lilies."

845
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,640
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>那一个小时  没人对我说"妈妈干这个"
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>You know, for an hour, it wasn't "Mommy can you do this"

846
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,570
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>或"亲爱的干那个"  我是我自己
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>or "Honey can you do that." You know, I was me.

847
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,680
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>但是  几个星期后
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>Oh, god. After a few weeks,

848
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,610
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>从博物馆见面变成了旅馆幽会
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>the museum turned into a hotel.

849
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,980
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>接着  谢尔比的舞蹈课也结束了
<34-7,ANDREA FISHER>And... then Shelby's dance classes ended.

850
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,150
<34-8,CASTLE>你再没有理由到市区去了
<34-8,CASTLE>You had no excuse to go into the city anymore.

851
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,500
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>初次见面时  我们装作是间谍
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>When we first met, we pretended to be spies,

852
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,750
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>在博物馆交换秘密
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>exchanging secrets at the museum.

853
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,480
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>罗杰就想  为何不来一场真实的间谍冒险呢
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>Roger thought, why not have a real-life spy adventure?

854
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,250
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>那样我们还有最后一次机会在一起
<34-9,ANDREA FISHER>And we could have one last time together.

855
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,200
<34-10,KEN FISHER>亲爱的  我回来了
<34-10,KEN FISHER>Hey, hon. I'm back.

856

<34-11,ANDREA FISHER>天哪  求你们别告诉我丈夫
<34-11,ANDREA FISHER>Oh, my god. Please don't tell my husband.

857
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
<34-12,BECKETT>没这个必要  费舍尔太太
<34-12,BECKETT>We don't have to, Mrs. Fisher.

858
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,870

862
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,760

<34-15,KEN FISHER>What's this about?

<34-19,KEN FISHER>我离开超市时车撞到柱子
<34-19,KEN FISHER>I hit a pole while I was backing out at the supermarket.

867
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,460
<34-20,CASTLE>你作为射击手  可强过说谎许多
<34-20,CASTLE>You're a much better shot than you are a liar.

868
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,610

874
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,600
<35-1,MONTGOMERY>罗杰那晚觉得被跟踪是正确的
<35-1,MONTGOMERY>So Roger was right about being followed that night.

875
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,510
<35-2,BECKETT>当这位丈夫发现妻子的婚外情后
<35-2,BECKETT>Well, when the husband got on to the affair,

876
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,800
<35-2,BECKETT>他也来了场间谍游戏
<35-2,BECKETT>he did a little spy game of his own--

879
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,570
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>有个男人因此丧命真悲哀  只因所有相关当事人
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>It's sad a man had to die because all the people involved

880
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,090
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>都害怕说出真实的感觉
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>were too scared to say what they really felt.

906
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,850
