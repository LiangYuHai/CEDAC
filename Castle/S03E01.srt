23
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:37,840
<34-9,BECKETT>他去哪了
<34-9,BECKETT>Where'd he go?!

24
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,510
<34-9,BECKETT>我把他跟丢了
<34-9,BECKETT>I lost him.

25
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,980
<34-9,BECKETT>他好像从这里出去了
<34-9,BECKETT>I think he went through here!

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,490
<34-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  趴到地上  快点
<34-9,BECKETT>Castle, down on the ground, now!

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,510
<3-1,BECKETT>你俩这是在重组
<3-1,BECKETT>Are you guys re-enacting

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,430
<3-1,BECKETT>"哼菩堤-蹬菩堤"罪案现场么
<3-1,BECKETT>the humpty dumpty crime scene?

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,830
<3-2,RYAN>今天是秋分哎
<3-2,RYAN>It's the autumnal equinox today.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
<3-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  根据这位巫师先生的说法
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and according to Mr. Wizard there,

33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,920
<3-3,ESPOSITO>一年之中只有这一天
<3-3,ESPOSITO>It's the only time of year

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,970
<3-3,ESPOSITO>你能把鸡蛋给立起来
<3-3,ESPOSITO>you can balance an egg on its tip.

35
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,100
<3-4,BECKETT>-你们俩没正事儿可做么  -没
<3-4,BECKETT>- Don't you guys have work to do? - Nah.

36

<3-7,BECKETT>-嗯  没事做  -是么  那现在有了
<3-7,BECKETT>No, not really. Hmm. Well, now you do.

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,030
<3-8,BECKETT>还有  那什么把鸡蛋立起来的说法
<3-8,BECKETT>By the way, that whole thing with the egg

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,390
<3-8,BECKETT>-根本就是哄小孩儿的  -才不是
<3-8,BECKETT>- Is just urban legend. - Not true.

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,010
<3-9,RYAN>去年我就看到卡塞尔做到了
<3-9,RYAN>I saw Castle do it last year.

40
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,220
<3-10,ESPOSITO>哪壶不开提哪壶
<3-10,ESPOSITO>What's wrong with you?

41
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,770
<3-10,ESPOSITO>他还没和你联系么
<3-10,ESPOSITO>Still no word from him?

42
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:07,970
<3-11,BECKETT>没有
<3-11,BECKETT>No.

43
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,370
<3-12,RYAN>也许你应该打电话给他
<3-12,RYAN>Maybe you should call him.

44
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,390
<3-13,BECKETT>他自己说他秋天会回来的
<3-13,BECKETT>He said that he would be back the fall,

45
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,910
<3-13,BECKETT>现在秋天已经到了
<3-13,BECKETT>and it's fall,

46
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,600
<3-13,BECKETT>很明显他已经乐不思蜀了
<3-13,BECKETT>so clearly, he has better things to do.

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,710
<3-14,ESPOSITO>也许他还没从汉普顿回来吧
<3-14,ESPOSITO>Maybe he's not back from the hamptons yet.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,920
<3-14,ESPOSITO>也许他的书还没写完
<3-14,ESPOSITO>Maybe he's still working on his book.

50
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,970
<3-14,ESPOSITO>是的
<3-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

51
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,780
<4-1,RYAN>刚才还说到哼菩堤-蹬菩堤来着
<4-1,RYAN>Ooh. Speaking of humpty dumpty.

52
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,810
<4-2,BECKETT>也许有人也想把她大头朝下倒立起来
<4-2,BECKETT>Maybe somebody tried to stand her up on her head.

53
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,290
<4-2,BECKETT>毕竟今天是秋分嘛
<4-2,BECKETT>After all, it is the autumnal equinox.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,080
<4-3,LANIE>她不是坠落致死的[fall亦有"秋天"之意]
<4-3,LANIE>It wasn't the fall that killed her.

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,740
<4-3,LANIE>她从上面那扇窗纵身跳下之前
<4-3,LANIE>More like multiple gunshot wounds to the torso

56
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,340
<4-3,LANIE>身体已经有多处中了枪
<4-3,LANIE>before doing a Greg Louganis out that window up there.

57
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,250
<4-3,LANIE>死者名叫克洛伊·惠特曼
<4-3,LANIE>Victim's name is Chloe Whitman.

58
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,450
<4-4,ESPOSITO>几个行人听到枪声
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Couple of pedestrians heard shots

59
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,770
<4-4,ESPOSITO>然后看到尸体从窗口坠下
<4-4,ESPOSITO>and saw the body fall out the window,

60
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,000
<4-4,ESPOSITO>但是当警员赶到时
<4-4,ESPOSITO>But when uniforms got here,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,740
<4-4,ESPOSITO>公寓空无一人
<4-4,ESPOSITO>the apartment was empty.

62
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,260
<4-4,ESPOSITO>也没有门卫当值
<4-4,ESPOSITO>There's no doorman on duty,

63
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,070
<4-4,ESPOSITO>所以目前为止  没人能回忆起
<4-4,ESPOSITO>so, so far, no one recalls

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
<4-4,ESPOSITO>见到任何人从现场逃走
<4-4,ESPOSITO>seeing anyone flee the scene.

65
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,690
<4-5,BECKETT>好的  让警员开始挨家挨户敲门询问
<4-5,BECKETT>All right, have uniforms start knocking on doors.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,690
<4-5,BECKETT>看看还有什么是邻居们没有看见的
<4-5,BECKETT>Find out what else our neighbors didn't see.

67
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,310
<4-6,RYAN>看  是卡塞尔耶
<4-6,RYAN>Hey, it's Castle.

69
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,720
<4-7,RYAN>看来他确实写完书了
<4-7,RYAN>Guess he did finish that book.

70
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,840
<4-8,LANIE>他寄本样书给我们会死啊
<4-8,LANIE>Nice of him to send us a copy.

71
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,730
<4-9,RYAN>看来他已经回到城里了
<4-9,RYAN>It looks like he's back in town.

72
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,320
<4-10,ESPOSITO>他打个电话给我们会死啊
<4-10,ESPOSITO>Nice of him to call.

73
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,530
<4-11,BECKETT>行了吧你们俩
<4-11,BECKETT>All right, guys.

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,580
<4-11,BECKETT>别念念不忘你们的爱人了
<4-11,BECKETT>You can stop pining for your girlfriend.

75
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,990
<4-11,BECKETT>别忘了咱们面前还有具满身弹孔的尸体呢
<4-11,BECKETT>After all, we got a body full of holes.

76
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,250
<4-11,BECKETT>死者还有什么其他信息吗
<4-11,BECKETT>So what else do we know about our victim?

77
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,770
<4-12,ESPOSITO>她有个男友  名叫伊万·墨菲  他正在赶来
<4-12,ESPOSITO>She's got a boyfriend. Evan Murphy. He's on his way.

78
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,340
<4-13,BECKETT>好的  咱们上楼看看还有什么发现
<4-13,BECKETT>Okay, let's go upstairs and see what else we can find.

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,420
<4-14,RYAN>他还真是全身散发着粗旷美
<4-14,RYAN>He really is ruggedly handsome.

80
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,060
<4-14,RYAN>唉
<4-14,RYAN>Mm.

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,800
<5-1,ESPOSITO>从血的喷溅形状来看
<5-1,ESPOSITO>From the spatter pattern,

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,700
<5-1,ESPOSITO>她当时是背朝着门口的
<5-1,ESPOSITO>she was backing away from the door.

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,180
<5-1,ESPOSITO>中了第一枪以后  她试图逃开
<5-1,ESPOSITO>After the first bullet hits her, she tries to get away.

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,990
<5-1,ESPOSITO>但是除了跳窗以外无处可逃
<5-1,ESPOSITO>Got nowhere to go but out the window.

85
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,800
<5-2,BECKETT>大口径手枪
<5-2,BECKETT>So large caliber gun.

86
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,120
<5-2,BECKETT>子弹击穿了她的身体  然后打碎了玻璃
<5-2,BECKETT>Round goes through her and breaks the glass.

87
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,170
<5-3,ESPOSITO>接着她就从窗口跳了出去
<5-3,ESPOSITO>She goes diving out.

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
<5-4,BECKETT>看起来她正打算出城
<5-4,BECKETT>Looks like she was leaving town.

89
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,060
<5-5,BECKETT>这不是抢劫
<5-5,BECKETT>Well, it wasn't a robbery.

90
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,660
<5-5,BECKETT>麻烦你检查一下这些东西上面的纤维和指纹
<5-5,BECKETT>Would you check these items for fibers and prints?

91
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,770
<5-5,BECKETT>运气好的话  挣扎时会留下痕迹
<5-5,BECKETT>If we're lucky, there was a struggle.

92
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,070
<5-5,BECKETT>当然  包在我们身上
<5-5,BECKETT>Sure. We'll take care of it.

93
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,840
<5-6,RYAN>贝克特  克洛伊的男友伊万来了
<5-6,RYAN>Beckett, Chloe's boyfriend Evan is here.

94
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,910
<6-1,EVAN MURPHY>也就是说有人毫无缘由地
<6-1,EVAN MURPHY>So someone just came here

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,030
<6-1,EVAN MURPHY>来这儿朝她开了几枪
<6-1,EVAN MURPHY>and shot her for no reason?

96
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,990
<6-2,BECKETT>通常来说  这类案件总是会有原因可寻的
<6-2,BECKETT>Well, usually, in cases like these, there is a reason.

97
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,270
<6-2,BECKETT>你和惠特曼女士在一起多久了
<6-2,BECKETT>How long had you and Ms. Whitman been dating?

<6-4,BECKETT>那她身边有没有什么人有暴力倾向
<6-4,BECKETT>And was there anyone in her life with violent tendencies,

100
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,220
<6-4,BECKETT>也许是某个和她发生过口角的人
<6-4,BECKETT>maybe anyone that she had disputes with?

101
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,510
<6-5,EVAN>没有  她...
<6-5,EVAN>No. No, she...

102
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,810
<6-5,EVAN>我见她做过最坏的事就是乱穿马路而已
<6-5,EVAN>The worst thing I ever saw her do was jaywalk.

103
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,050
<6-6,BECKETT>-她是做什么工作的  -她是个老师
<6-6,BECKETT>- What did she do for a living? - She's a teacher.

<6-8,BECKETT>Were you expecting her over tonight?

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,140
<6-10,BECKETT>-没有  怎么了  -她整理了一包过夜的行李
<6-10,BECKETT>- No. Why? - Well, she packed an overnight bag.

108
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,030
<6-11,EVAN>这...这没理由啊
<6-11,EVAN>That-- that doesn't make sense.

109
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,040
<6-11,EVAN>她明天上午还要上课
<6-11,EVAN>She--she has class tomorrow.

110
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,980

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,630
<6-11,EVAN>失陪一下
<6-11,EVAN>Excuse me.

<7-17,BECKETT>It never is. Turn around.

134
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,120
<7-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  转过身去
<7-17,BECKETT>Castle, turn around.

135
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,440
<7-17,BECKETT>理查德·卡塞尔  你因为涉嫌谋杀被捕了
<7-17,BECKETT>Richard castle, you're under arrest for murder.

136
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,520
<8-1,CASTLE>感觉有点不一样了
<8-1,CASTLE>Something's different.

137
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,510
<8-1,CASTLE>你们重新装潢过了么
<8-1,CASTLE>Did you remodel?

138
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,610
<8-2,BECKETT>你知道你自己的权利了吧  卡塞尔先生
<8-2,BECKETT>You've been informed of your rights, Mr. Castle?

139
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,570
<8-2,BECKETT>你来真的啊
<8-2,BECKETT>Really?

140
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,880
<8-3,CASTLE>你都不打算问问我暑假过的怎样么
<8-3,CASTLE>You're not even gonna ask me how my summer was?

141
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,150
<8-4,BECKETT>你意识到你现在因为谋杀被捕了吧
<8-4,BECKETT>You are aware that you're under arrest for murder?

142
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,780
<8-5,CASTLE>我还以为你把我铐得那么狠是因为好玩儿呢
<8-5,CASTLE>I thought you were being rough with the cuffs just for fun.

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,450
<8-6,CASTLE>你气色不错
<8-6,CASTLE>You look good.

<8-10,CASTLE>- For murder. - Why are you so mad at me?

147
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,810
<8-11,BECKETT>也许是因为我抓到你站在一具尸体旁边
<8-11,BECKETT>Maybe because you were found standing over a dead body

148
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,200
<8-11,BECKETT>手上还拿着一把枪吧
<8-11,BECKETT>with a gun in your hand.

<8-13,BECKETT>你为什么不打电话给我
<8-13,BECKETT>Why didn't you call?

152
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
<8-14,CASTLE>我正准备打电话给你
<8-14,CASTLE>I was going to call you.

<8-17,BECKETT>Oh, so you and Ms. Santori were in a relationship.

159
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,200
<8-18,CASTLE>那可谈不上是什么关系
<8-18,CASTLE>Well, I wouldn't say it was a relationship.

160
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,510
<8-18,CASTLE>我从她那儿买了几尊雕塑而已
<8-18,CASTLE>I bought a couple of sculptures from her.

161

180
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,940
<8-34,BECKETT>这个打电话给你的死者  电话里怎么说
<8-34,BECKETT>This victim that called you, what was it about?

181
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,630
<8-34,BECKETT>她说她遇到了麻烦
<8-34,BECKETT>She said she was in trouble

182
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,100
<8-35,CASTLE>但她不能去报警
<8-35,CASTLE>and she couldn't go to the police.

183
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,690
<8-36,BECKETT>那她为什么打电话给你
<8-36,BECKETT>So why did she call you?

184
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,240
<8-37,CASTLE>因为玛雅知道我和你有关系  噢
<8-37,CASTLE>Because Maya knew I had a relationship with you--ooh.

185
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,760
<8-37,CASTLE>是和纽约警局有关系
<8-37,CASTLE>With the NYPD.

186
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,760
<8-37,CASTLE>-她以为我能帮上忙  -怎么帮
<8-37,CASTLE>- She thought I could help. - Help how?

187
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,940
<8-39,CASTLE>这个她没说  她只是叫我过去
<8-39,CASTLE>Well, she didn't say. She just told me to come over.

188
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,150
<8-39,CASTLE>我到那儿的时候  门开着
<8-39,CASTLE>When I got the, the door was open.

189
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,260
<8-39,CASTLE>那地方一片狼藉
<8-39,CASTLE>The place was trashed.

190
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,600
<8-39,CASTLE>她被杀死在床上
<8-39,CASTLE>She was dead on the bed,

191
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,630
<8-39,CASTLE>地板上放着一把枪
<8-39,CASTLE>and there was a gun on the floor.

192
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,320
<8-40,BECKETT>你作为一个经常出入犯罪现场
<8-40,BECKETT>So you, being the expert veteran of

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,340
<8-40,BECKETT>经验丰富的老手
<8-40,BECKETT>dozens of crime scenes,

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,410
<8-40,BECKETT>竟然就这么捡起地上的凶器
<8-40,BECKETT>decided to pick up the murder weapon to,

195
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,700
<8-40,BECKETT>怎么  你是要确保我们有你的指纹么
<8-40,BECKETT>what, ensure that we had your prints?

196
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,670
<8-41,CASTLE>也许是你听漏了我刚才说的
<8-41,CASTLE>Maybe you missed the part where

197
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,670
<8-41,CASTLE>她被人开枪打死了
<8-41,CASTLE>I said she was shot dead.

198
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,450
<8-41,CASTLE>当我听到隔壁房间传来的动静
<8-41,CASTLE>When I heard the noises coming from the next room,

199
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,440
<8-41,CASTLE>我以为是杀死她的人又回来了
<8-41,CASTLE>I thought whoever killed her was coming back.

200
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,120
<8-41,CASTLE>于是我捡起枪用来自卫
<8-41,CASTLE>So I picked up the gun to defend myself.

201
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,190
<8-41,CASTLE>这个想法在当时的情境下无可厚非
<8-41,CASTLE>It seemed like a very good idea at the time.

202
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,610
<8-41,CASTLE>就在这时 你  埃斯波西多
<8-41,CASTLE>That's when you, esposito and

203
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,810
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>还有安妮·欧克丽就撞门进来了
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>Annie Oakley come bursting through the door.

204
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,720
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>安妮·欧克丽
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>十九世纪闻名美国西部的女神枪手

205
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,410
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>安妮·欧克丽
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>Annie Oakley?

206
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,870
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>埃斯波西多警探的反应是出于...
<9-1,CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY>Detective Esposito was responding--

207
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,530
<9-2,RYAN>我又不会威胁到你们
<9-2,RYAN>I am not a threat...

208
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
<9-2,RYAN>我差点就击中了卡塞尔
<9-2,RYAN>I kinda almost shot Castle.

209
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,470
<9-2,RYAN>谁让他手上有枪啊
<9-2,RYAN>What? He had a gun.

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,880
<9-3,ESPOSITO>真该让你一枪毙了他
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Shoulda let you shoot him.

211
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,020
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这就是不打电话给我们的下场
<9-3,ESPOSITO>It would've served him right for not calling.

212
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,290
<9-3,ESPOSITO>我们现在应该在犯罪现场找线索才对
<9-3,ESPOSITO>We should be at the crime scene looking for clues.

213
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,210
<10-1,BECKETT>你说说看  我凭什么相信你
<10-1,BECKETT>So tell me, why should I believe you,

214
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,770
<10-1,BECKETT>别忘了
<10-1,BECKETT>Considering that

215
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,740
<10-1,BECKETT>你基本是靠编故事谋生的
<10-1,BECKETT>you pretty much make up stories for a living?

216
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,540
<10-2,CASTLE>因为你了解我啊
<10-2,CASTLE>Because you know me.

217
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,340
<10-3,BECKETT>你认识她吗  克洛伊·惠特曼
<10-3,BECKETT>Do you know her? Chloe Whitman.

218
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,930
<10-3,BECKETT>她被人开枪打死了
<10-3,BECKETT>She was shot to death.

219
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,920
<10-3,BECKETT>在她死后  我们在她的手心里发现了
<10-3,BECKETT>Your friend's address was found in her hands

220
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,190
<10-3,BECKETT>你朋友的地址
<10-3,BECKETT>after she was killed.

221
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,390
<10-4,CASTLE>又一起谋杀  她们俩有什么联系吗
<10-4,CASTLE>Another murder? What's their connection?

222
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,590
<10-5,BECKETT>我怎么知道  拿枪站在尸体边上的是你
<10-5,BECKETT>I don't know. You were the one with the gun.

223
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,320
<10-5,BECKETT>应该你告诉我才对
<10-5,BECKETT>You tell me.

224
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,820
<10-6,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  过来说句话
<10-6,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, a word.

225
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,520
<10-7,CASTLE>嗨队长  最近如何呀
<10-7,CASTLE>Hey, captain. How's it going?

226
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,400
<10-8,CASTLE>不是吧  你也这样
<10-8,CASTLE>What? You, too?

227
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,760
<10-8,CASTLE>搞什么...
<10-8,CASTLE>Real--

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,040
<10-8,CASTLE>别这样啊各位
<10-8,CASTLE>Come on, guys.

229
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,880
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>鉴证小组复原了玛雅·桑托丽
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>C.S.U. Recovered the slugs

230
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,740
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>和克洛伊·惠特曼家里的弹壳
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>from Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman's place.

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,030
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>那枪是点45口径的
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>The gun was a .45.

232
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,070
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔的枪是点38口径
<10-9,MONTGOMERY>Castle was holding a .38.

233
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,550
<10-10,BECKETT>也就说那枪确实是受害者用来自卫的
<10-10,BECKETT>So it must have belonged to the victim for self-defense,

234
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,510
<10-10,BECKETT>也就意味着卡塞尔说的是实话
<10-10,BECKETT>which means that Castle was telling the truth.

235
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,860
<10-11,MONTGOMERY>但如果你想的话  我很乐意继续关着他
<10-11,MONTGOMERY>But I'd be happy to hold him if you like.

236
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,950
<10-12,BECKETT>你可以走了
<10-12,BECKETT>You're free to go.

237
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,680
<10-13,CASTLE>这就没了
<10-13,CASTLE>Well, that's it?

238
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,750
<10-14,BECKETT>子弹和你的枪不吻合  你洗脱嫌疑了
<10-14,BECKETT>Bullets don't match your gun. You're off the hook.

239

241
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,180
<10-17,BECKETT>没有下一步  有也没你份
<10-17,BECKETT>There isn't one, at least not for you.

<10-18,CASTLE>Two victims, one of 'em an acquaintance of mine,

244
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,350
<10-18,CASTLE>你竟然要我回家
<10-18,CASTLE>and you're sending me home?

245
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,040
<10-19,BECKETT>你是证人  卡塞尔  我不能让你参与
<10-19,BECKETT>You're a witness, Castle. I can't have you involved.

246
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,920
<10-20,CASTLE>-我已经参与了  -回家  卡塞尔
<10-20,CASTLE>- I'm already involved. - Castle, go home.

<10-21,BECKETT>我还有工作要做
<10-21,BECKETT>Okay? I've got work to do.

250
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,210
<10-22,CASTLE>我到底做错了什么
<10-22,CASTLE>What did I do?

251
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,800
<11-1,MARTHA>亲爱的

<11-1,MARTHA>非常的...欠扁
<11-1,MARTHA>It's absolutely... charming.

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,960
<11-2,ALEXIS>一个企鹅把另一只企鹅打到冰窟窿里去了
<11-2,ALEXIS>A penguin smacks another penguin into an ice hole.

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,800
<11-4,MARTHA>看起来你像是被人打进了冰窟窿
<11-4,MARTHA>Oh, you look as if someone smacked you into an ice hole.

<11-6,ALEXIS>I thought you weren't going back till after the book tour.

260
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,940
<11-7,CASTLE>是啊  计划赶不上变化
<11-7,CASTLE>Yeah, well, fate intervened.

<11-9,ALEXIS>Dad, that's awful. Who?

263
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,450
<11-10,CASTLE>玛雅  给我做那个雕像的女人
<11-10,CASTLE>Maya. The woman who made that sculpture for me.

<11-12,CASTLE>-有线索吗  -目前没有
<11-12,CASTLE>- Any leads? - No, not yet.

268
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,220
<11-15,MARTHA>我可不信
<11-15,MARTHA>Now why don't I believe you?

269
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,160
<11-16,CASTLE>你周二不是会去切特那里吗
<11-16,CASTLE>Aren't you with Chet on Tuesdays?

270
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,720
<11-17,MARTHA>事情可不是一成不变的
<11-17,MARTHA>Oh! That was never set in stone.

271
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,430
<11-17,MARTHA>再说  阿丽克西斯有苦恼
<11-17,MARTHA>Besides, Alexis is in crisis.

272
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,440
<11-17,MARTHA>暑期培训认识的男孩
<11-17,MARTHA>The young man from the summer program

273
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,980
<11-17,MARTHA>还没有给她打电话
<11-17,MARTHA>still hasn't called her.

274
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,240
<11-18,ALEXIS>尽管他说过他
<11-18,ALEXIS>Despite the fact he said we'd talk

275
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,050
<11-18,ALEXIS>从欧洲回来就会给我打电话  可他没有
<11-18,ALEXIS>when he got back from Europe, which he already did.

276
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,600
<11-19,CASTLE>既然你知道他回来了
<11-19,CASTLE>Well, if you knew he was back,

277
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,830
<11-19,CASTLE>为什么你不打给他
<11-19,CASTLE>why don't you just call him?

278
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,940
<11-20,ALEXIS>走的是他又不是我
<11-20,ALEXIS>He's the one who went away.

279
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,310
<11-20,ALEXIS>他要是在乎我  就会打电话了
<11-20,ALEXIS>I mean, if he still cared, he would've called.

280
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,510
<11-21,CASTLE>也许他想打电话  但是
<11-21,CASTLE>Maybe he was going to, but he didn't know

281
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,640
<11-21,CASTLE>他不知道你的想法  也许他担心
<11-21,CASTLE>how you'd feel about it. Maybe he was worried

282
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,470
<11-21,CASTLE>在他走的这段时间事情有所变化
<11-21,CASTLE>that something had changed while he was away.

283
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,510
<11-22,MARTHA>理查德·卡塞尔
<11-22,MARTHA>Oh, Richard Castle,

284
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,290
<11-22,MARTHA>这是我听过最蠢的话了
<11-22,MARTHA>that is the stupidest thg I ever heard.

285
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,570
<11-22,MARTHA>关于感情这个问题我难道没教过你吗
<11-22,MARTHA>Have I taught you nothing about relationships?

286
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,380
<11-23,CASTLE>您老是个活生生的榜样
<11-23,CASTLE>You're a shining example.

287
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,300
<11-23,CASTLE>到底这个问题有多严重
<11-23,CASTLE>Just how big a deal is this anyway?

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
<11-24,ALEXIS>我感觉我再也不想见到他了
<11-24,ALEXIS>I don't know if I even want to see him anymore.

289
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,880
<11-25,CASTLE>拜托  你都没给他一次机会
<11-25,CASTLE>Oh, come on. You're not even giving him a chance.

290
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,210
<11-26,ALEXIS>你为什么替他说话
<11-26,ALEXIS>Why are you siding with him?

291
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,390
<11-27,CASTLE>我没有  我只是...也许他会
<11-27,CASTLE>I'm not. I ju-- maybe he'll do something

292
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,480
<11-27,CASTLE>想办法弥补的
<11-27,CASTLE>that will make it right.

293
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,740
<11-27,CASTLE>也许他会给你来个惊喜
<11-27,CASTLE>Maybe he'll just-- maybe he'll surprise you.

294
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,450
<11-28,ALEXIS>也许他没这个机会了
<11-28,ALEXIS>Maybe he missed his chance.

295
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,230
<12-1,ESPOSITO>要我说
<12-1,ESPOSITO>If you ask me,

296
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,340
<12-1,ESPOSITO>你应该把他关起来  出出这口恶气
<12-1,ESPOSITO>you shoulda locked him up just outta spite.

297
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,770
<12-2,BECKETT>不行  那样太缺德了
<12-2,BECKETT>No, that'd be unethical...

298
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,040
<12-2,BECKETT>不能放他去祸害那些拘留所的同事们
<12-2,BECKETT>Making the people down in holding deal with him.

299
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,460

<12-5,BECKETT>证人排查有线索吗
<12-5,BECKETT>Anything on the canvass?

<12-6,RYAN>to Maya's friends and neighbors.

307
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,320
<12-6,RYAN>他们不认识她
<12-6,RYAN>They don't recognize her.

310
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,130
<12-7,ESPOSITO>则根本不认识玛雅
<12-7,ESPOSITO>They don't know Maya either.

<12-8,BECKETT>根据大家的说法  生活完全没有交集
<12-8,BECKETT>and by all accounts, run in completely different circles.

316

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,810
<12-8,BECKETT>凶手又是同一个人
<12-8,BECKETT>and by the same person.

318
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,540
<12-8,BECKETT>她们的生活一定还是有交集的
<12-8,BECKETT>The lives must intersect somehow.

319

347
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,790
<14-10,LANIE>看上去是同一个人给她们纹上去的
<14-10,LANIE>Looking at the work, it could be the same tattoo artist.

348
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,160
<14-11,BECKETT>还有其他线索吗
<14-11,BECKETT>Anything else?

349
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,060
<14-12,LANIE>也许不是线索
<14-12,LANIE>It may be nothing,

350
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,420
<14-12,LANIE>但是我在惠特曼的手上发现了这个

<14-14,LANIE>Could be an apartment number,

353
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,440
<14-14,LANIE>健身房储物柜子号码  从褪色程度来看

<14-14,LANIE>-这是一周前写在手上的  -好的
<14-14,LANIE>- I'd say she wrote it about a week ago. - Okay.

<14-19,BECKETT>我给出租车公司打电话
<14-19,BECKETT>Okay, I'll call up the cab company,

359
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,290
<14-19,BECKETT>看看能不能追查到她的去处
<14-19,BECKETT>see if we can retrace her whereabouts.

360
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,410
<14-20,LANIE>你真不想和我谈谈
<14-20,LANIE>Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?

361

<14-21,BECKETT>不想
<14-21,BECKETT>Positive!

363
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,980
<14-22,ESPOSITO>我们拿到了被害人的电话记录
<14-22,ESPOSITO>We just got the phone records back on our vics.

364
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,650
<14-22,ESPOSITO>原来她们有交集
<14-22,ESPOSITO>Turns out they did have a connection.

365
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,650
<14-22,ESPOSITO>她们死前不久都接到了同一个号码
<14-22,ESPOSITO>They both received phone calls from the same number

366
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,640
<14-22,ESPOSITO>打来的电话
<14-22,ESPOSITO>within hours of their deaths.

367
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,580
<14-23,BECKETT>能查到来源吗
<14-23,BECKETT>Were you able to run it down?

368
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,520
<14-24,ESPOSITO>找到了  这个人叫托德·麦卡奇
<14-24,ESPOSITO>Yeah, it traced back to a Todd McCutchin.

<14-24,ESPOSITO>他有抢劫和家庭暴力等前科
<14-24,ESPOSITO>He's got priors including robbery and domestic assault.

<15-1,ESPOSITO>我说把手举...
<15-1,ESPOSITO>I said let me see your h--

374
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,730
<16-1,CASTLE>我能解释的
<16-1,CASTLE>I can explain.

375
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,890
<16-2,BECKETT>转过身去
<16-2,BECKETT>Turn around.

376
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,390
<16-3,CASTLE>你就不能先听我解释一下嘛
<16-3,CASTLE>Oh, would you just listen to me, please?

377
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,390
<16-4,BECKETT>有什么可听的  你先不听话的
<16-4,BECKETT>Why? Youu don't listen to me.

378
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,210
<16-5,CASTLE>我只不过是自己在调查
<16-5,CASTLE>Look, I was doing some digging around on my own.

379
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,630
<16-5,CASTLE>-这又不算犯法  -没错
<16-5,CASTLE>- That's not a crime, is it? - No,

380
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,750
<16-6,BECKETT>但是非法闯入犯法  谋杀更犯法
<16-6,BECKETT>but criminal trespassing is, and so is murder.

381
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,790
<16-7,CASTLE>我只不过是想帮忙
<16-7,CASTLE>I was just trying to help.

382
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,120
<16-8,BECKETT>我不用你帮忙
<16-8,BECKETT>I don't need your help.

383
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
<16-8,BECKETT>你是怎么跑到这里的
<16-8,BECKETT>How did you get here anyway?

384
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:47,300
<16-9,CASTLE>-和你一样  我在追查一条线索  -是吗
<16-9,CASTLE>- I was following up a lead, same as you. - Oh, really?

385
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,270
<16-10,BECKETT>那么说你传唤了死者的电话记录
<16-10,BECKETT>So you subpoenaed the victims' phone records

386
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,140
<16-11,CASTLE>-找到了她们的共同点  是吗  -不是
<16-11,CASTLE>- and looked for commonalities? - No, not exactly.

387
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,140
<16-12,BECKETT>到底是怎么回事
<16-12,BECKETT>Then what?

388
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,420
<16-13,CASTLE>疼  好吧  告诉你  我反向查了电话号码
<16-13,CASTLE>Ow! Okay! I star-6-9'ed. I star-6-9'ed.

389
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,680
<16-14,BECKETT>-你反向查了电话号码  -用的玛雅的手机
<16-14,BECKETT>- You star-69'ed? - Yes, on maya's phone.

390
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,950
<16-15,CASTLE>我想反向查号码能得知最后的通话记录
<16-15,CASTLE>I figured it would give me her last call.

391
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,290
<16-15,CASTLE>电话拨到了麦卡奇这
<16-15,CASTLE>It rang up McCutchin here.

392
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,720
<16-15,CASTLE>在答录机上听到了他的姓氏
<16-15,CASTLE>I got his name from his voice mail,

393
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,170
<16-15,CASTLE>之后我就网上人肉他
<16-15,CASTLE>And then I did a web search.

394
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,460
<16-15,CASTLE>我厉害吧  崇拜我吧
<16-15,CASTLE>Tell me you're not impressed.

395
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,560
<16-16,BECKETT>未经允许你就进了正在调查的犯罪现场
<16-16,BECKETT>You went to an active crime scene without authorization.

396
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,260
<16-16,BECKETT>那个...
<16-16,BECKETT>Uh...

397
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,730
<16-17,CASTLE>是的
<16-17,CASTLE>Yeah.

398
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,200
<16-17,CASTLE>但是我戴手套了
<16-17,CASTLE>But I wore gloves.

399
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,570
<16-18,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<16-18,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

400
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
<16-18,ESPOSITO>尸体温度很低  应该死了很长时间
<16-18,ESPOSITO>His body's cold. He's been dead for hours.

401
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,290
<16-19,CASTLE>看吧  不是我杀的
<16-19,CASTLE>See? I didn't kill him.

402
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,710
<16-20,BECKETT>弹壳呢
<16-20,BECKETT>Slugs?

403
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,980
<16-21,ESPOSITO>还要查弹道
<16-21,ESPOSITO>We'll have to run ballistics,

404
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,480
<16-21,ESPOSITO>但是枪击伤口和前两位被害人身上的相同
<16-21,ESPOSITO>but the entry wounds are the same size as our other vics.

405
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
<16-22,RYAN>奇怪
<16-22,RYAN>Odd.

406
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,760
<16-23,BECKETT>-怎么了  -这小子修自动贩卖机的
<16-23,BECKETT>- What? - Well, the guy's in vending machines.

407
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,700
<16-24,RYAN>看起来不像是能和
<16-24,RYAN>Not an obvious choice to be running around

408
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,720
<16-24,RYAN>艺术家和高中老师混到一起的人
<16-24,RYAN>with an artist and a prep school teacher.

409
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,120
<16-24,RYAN>是啊
<16-24,RYAN>Hmm.

410
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,210
<16-25,BECKETT>让鉴证组到这里来
<16-25,BECKETT>Okay, so let's get CSU down here

411
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,580
<16-25,BECKETT>查找纤维和指纹
<16-25,BECKETT>to look for fibers and prints.

412
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,560
<16-25,BECKETT>再让他们查一查三个凶案现场的
<16-25,BECKETT>And have them start looking for commonalities

413
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,150
<16-25,BECKETT>共同之处
<16-25,BECKETT>between the three crimscenes.

414
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,700
<16-25,BECKETT>仔细查查他们的生活
<16-25,BECKETT>Let's start digging into their lives.

415
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,060
<16-25,BECKETT>哪怕用同一家约会网站
<16-25,BECKETT>If they were on the same dating site,

416
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,730
<16-25,BECKETT>也要让我知道
<16-25,BECKETT>I want to know.

417
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,680
<16-25,BECKETT>哪怕是他们一起参加自助培训
<16-25,BECKETT>If they were in the same 12-step program,

418
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,450
<16-25,BECKETT>也要让我知道
<16-25,BECKETT>I want to know.

419
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,540
<16-26,CASTLE>我能做什么
<16-26,CASTLE>How can I help?

420
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,720
<16-27,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔  对于你朋友的死我很抱歉
<16-27,BECKETT>Look, Castle, I'm sorry about your friend. I really am,

421
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,550
<16-27,BECKETT>但是你不能像这样突然出现
<16-27,BECKETT>but that doesn't mean that you can just show up

422
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,710
<16-27,BECKETT>就好像什么都没发生一样
<16-27,BECKETT>and act like nothing has happened.

423
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,480
<16-27,BECKETT>事实上  如果你想回来
<16-27,BECKETT>The truth is, if you wanted to come back,

424
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,450
<16-27,BECKETT>早就回来了  但是你没有
<16-27,BECKETT>you would've already, but you didn't.

425
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,110
<16-27,BECKETT>我们面对事实吧
<16-27,BECKETT>So let's just face it.

426
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,450
<16-27,BECKETT>你之所以会在这里
<16-27,BECKETT>The only reason that you're here right now

427
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,290
<16-27,BECKETT>不过是因为
<16-27,BECKETT>is because you were

428
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,560
<16-27,BECKETT>你在错误的时间出现在了错误的地方
<16-27,BECKETT>at the wrong place at the wrong time.

429
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,010
<16-28,CASTLE>你有没有想过
<16-28,CASTLE>You ever stop and think,

430
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,430
<16-28,CASTLE>我也在等你的电话
<16-28,CASTLE>maybe I was waiting to hear from you?

431
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,990
<16-29,CASTLE>你知道这些命案意味着什么吗
<16-29,CASTLE>Do you know what these bodies are?

432
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,120
<16-30,BECKETT>-一个信号  -一个信号
<16-30,BECKETT>- A sign. - A sign?

433
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,910
<16-31,CASTLE>是的  是冥冥之中
<16-31,CASTLE>A sign. A sign from the universe

434
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,930
<16-31,CASTLE>命运告诉我们  我们应该一起办这个案子
<16-31,CASTLE>telling us we need to solve this case together.

435
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,700
<16-31,CASTLE>你不是想要和命运对着干吧
<16-31,CASTLE>You don't want to let the universe down, do you?

436
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,540
<16-32,BECKETT>不管我做什么你都不会走开  是不是
<16-32,BECKETT>You're not gonna go away no matter what I do, are you?

437
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,110
<16-33,CASTLE>人家看到信号了
<16-33,CASTLE>I respect the universe.

438
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,310
<16-34,BECKETT>好吧  算你狠
<16-34,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

439
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,020
<16-34,BECKETT>我同意让你加入这个案子
<16-34,BECKETT>I will let you join me on this one case

440
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,920
<16-34,BECKETT>前提是你答应我  一切都听我的
<16-34,BECKETT>as long as you promise to do what I say when I say it

441
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,310
<16-34,BECKETT>不许再擅自调查了
<16-34,BECKETT>and not to do any investigating on your own.

442
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,990
<16-35,CASTLE>我保证  你不会后悔的
<16-35,CASTLE>I promise. You won't regret this.

443
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,730
<16-36,BECKETT>-已经后悔了  -现在开始吧
<16-36,BECKETT>- I already do. - Starting now.

444
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,450
<17-1,CASTLE>冰箱很吸引你吗
<17-1,CASTLE>What is it about the refrigerator?

445
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,560
<17-1,CASTLE>是因为它制冷  有光还是因为二者兼有
<17-1,CASTLE>Is it the cold, the light or the combination of the two?

446
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,440
<17-3,CASTLE>-睡不着  -因为那个男孩
<17-3,CASTLE>- I can't sleep. - Ah, the boy.

447
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,140
<17-4,ALEXIS>-他终于来电话了  -很好
<17-4,ALEXIS>- He finally called. - Great.

448
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,780
<17-7,CASTLE>-我没接  -为什么
<17-7,CASTLE>- I didn't answer. - Why not?

449
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,710
<17-8,ALEXIS>我生气嘛  我以为他会留言的
<17-8,ALEXIS>I was mad. I thought he'd leave a message,

450
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,560
<17-8,ALEXIS>可他没留  我该怎么办
<17-8,ALEXIS>But he didn't. So now what do I do?

451
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,110
<17-8,ALEXIS>他知道我知道他打电话了
<17-8,ALEXIS>He knows I know he called.

452
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,280
<17-8,ALEXIS>但是如果马上我打回去
<17-8,ALEXIS>But if call back right away,

453
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,950
<17-8,ALEXIS>那就会显得我是在等他的电话
<17-8,ALEXIS>Then clearly I'm admitting I was waiting for his call.

454
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,090
<17-8,ALEXIS>我要等多长时间才能回电话
<17-8,ALEXIS>How long do I need to wait to call him back,

455
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,080
<17-8,ALEXIS>一天吗  半天还是两天
<17-8,ALEXIS>A day, at least a day, maybe two?

456
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:29,060
<17-9,CASTLE>也许你应该换个新男友  重新开始
<17-9,CASTLE>Maybe you should get a new boyfriend and start over.

457
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,050
<17-10,ALEXIS>碰着这种问题你也没辙了  是吧
<17-10,ALEXIS>You're not very good at this, are you?

458
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,440
<17-11,CASTLE>明显没辙
<17-11,CASTLE>Apparently not.

459
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,720
<18-1,CASTLE>查到什么吗
<18-1,CASTLE>Anything?

460
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,680
<18-2,BECKETT>我们找到了托德·麦卡奇的未婚妻
<18-2,BECKETT>Uh, we tracked down Todd Mccutchin's fiance.

461
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,090
<18-2,BECKETT>她正赶过来
<18-2,BECKETT>She's on her way.

462
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,890
<18-3,CASTLE>有没有搜索到什么可疑的背景资料
<18-3,CASTLE>You find anything in their background checks?

463
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,290
<18-4,BECKETT>我们一直查到了小学
<18-4,BECKETT>Well, we went as far back as grade school,

464
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,650
<18-4,BECKETT>但没发现任何可疑的地方
<18-4,BECKETT>and nothing has popped yet.

465
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,030
<18-5,CASTLE>嗯  也许他们是中央情报局的高级特工
<18-5,CASTLE>Hmm. Maybe they're top CIA agents

466
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,030
<18-5,CASTLE>鸟尽弓藏兔死狗烹了
<18-5,CASTLE>targeted for termination, huh?

467
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,440
<18-6,BECKETT>你还真是三句不离中情局啊
<18-6,BECKETT>CIA's a popular theory with you.

468
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,400
<18-7,CASTLE>是啊  照常理来讲
<18-7,CASTLE>Yes, well, law of averages demands

469
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,840
<18-7,CASTLE>我一般最终都是是对的
<18-7,CASTLE>that I'll eventually be right.

470
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,210
<18-8,BECKETT>我都忘了您的高见是有多重要了
<18-8,BECKETT>I've forgotten how helpful your insights can be.

471
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,790
<18-9,CASTLE>哦  是吗
<18-9,CASTLE>Oh, yeah?

472
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,000
<18-9,CASTLE>打赌我比你先解决疑团
<18-9,CASTLE>I bet I figure out how they're connected before you do.

473
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,580
<18-9,CASTLE>行  我就跟你赌
<18-9,CASTLE>All right. You're on.

474
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,200
<18-10,BECKETT>但如果我赢了  你得保证走的远远的
<18-10,BECKETT>But if I win, you have to promise to go away

475
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,060
<18-10,BECKETT>从此不再插手我的案子
<18-10,BECKETT>and never interfere with any of my cases again.

476
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,610
<18-11,CASTLE>没问题  若我赢了
<18-11,CASTLE>Fine. And if I win...

477
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,280
<18-11,CASTLE>-就让我重新做你的搭档  -成交
<18-11,CASTLE>- You have to take me back as your partner.  - Deal.

478
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
<18-13,CASTLE>万一被他们先发现呢
<18-13,CASTLE>What if they figure it out first?

479
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,880
<18-14,BECKETT_CASTLE>-不可能  -不可能
<18-14,BECKETT_CASTLE>- Nah.  - Nah.

480
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,940
<18-15,RYAN>你们两个在嘀咕什么呢
<18-15,RYAN>What are you two talking about?

481
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,300
<18-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔在为没打电话过来而道歉
<18-16,BECKETT>Castle was just apologizing for not calling.

482
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,780
<18-17,BECKETT>你们有什么发现没有
<18-17,BECKETT>So what'd you guys find?

483
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,040
<18-18,ESPOSITO>从卡塞尔在玛雅的公寓
<18-18,ESPOSITO>Forensics on that blood smear

484
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:08,060
<18-18,ESPOSITO>发现的血液涂片的取证看来
<18-18,ESPOSITO>that castle found in Maya's apartment--

485
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,720
<18-18,ESPOSITO>和托德·麦卡奇的血型吻合
<18-18,ESPOSITO>It's a match to Todd Mccutchin's.

486
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,780
<18-19,RYAN>鉴证组在玛雅的鞋上
<18-19,RYAN>And C.S.U. Found some of

487
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,090
<18-19,RYAN>找到了几滴麦卡奇的血迹
<18-19,RYAN>Mccutchin's Blood on Maya's shoes.

488
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,460
<18-20,BECKETT>也就是说你朋友在他被杀之时或事发后
<18-20,BECKETT>Which means that your friend was at his place

489
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,040
<18-20,BECKETT>去过他家
<18-20,BECKETT>either during or after the murder.

490
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,900
<18-21,RYAN>我查了一下她口袋里的的士票据
<18-21,RYAN>Ran down those cab receipts from her pocket.

491
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,830
<18-21,RYAN>根据出租车公司的记录  她昨天早上
<18-21,RYAN>According to the taxi company, they picked her up

492
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,400
<18-21,RYAN>在麦卡奇的公寓外面上了车
<18-21,RYAN>outside Mccutchin's apartment yesterday morning,

493
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,860
<18-21,RYAN>然后去了包厘街的某处
<18-21,RYAN>took her somewhere in the bowery.

494
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,300
<18-21,RYAN>包厘街
<18-21,RYAN>The bowery?

495
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,270
<18-21,RYAN>没错  20分钟后
<18-21,RYAN>Yeah. Then 20 minutes later,

496
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,070
<18-21,RYAN>她又坐车回家去了
<18-21,RYAN>they picked her up and they dropped her off at home.

497
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,430
<18-23,CASTLE>就是在那之后她给我打的电话
<18-23,CASTLE>It was just after that that she called me.

498
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,380
<18-24,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  麦卡奇的未婚妻到了
<18-24,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, Mccutchin's fiance is here.

499
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,060
<19-1,ANA>抱歉  我从未见过她们
<19-1,ANA>I'm sorry. I've never seen them before.

500
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,070
<19-2,BECKETT>-你确定吗  - 你未婚夫有过作案记录
<19-2,BECKETT>- Are you sure?  - Your fiance had a record.

501
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,210
<19-3,CASTLE>有没有可能他在干一些
<19-3,CASTLE>Is it possible he was involved in...

502
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,510
<19-3,CASTLE>违法的事呢
<19-3,CASTLE>uh, anything illegal?

503
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,020
<19-4,ANA>托德是个好人
<19-4,ANA>Todd was a good man.

504
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,430
<19-4,ANA>我知道他以前做过一些坏事  但
<19-4,ANA>I know he did some bad things in the past, but...

505
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,560
<19-4,ANA>他有了自己的事业
<19-4,ANA>He got himself his own business.

506
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,300
<19-4,ANA>现在绝对是个合法商人
<19-4,ANA>He was totally legit now.

507
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,630
<19-5,BECKETT>不过
<19-5,BECKETT>Only...

508
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,370
<19-5,BECKETT>不过什么
<19-5,BECKETT>Only what?

509
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,490
<19-6,ANA>几个月前
<19-6,ANA>A couple months ago,

510
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,040
<19-6,ANA>托德弄伤了后背  不能做事了
<19-6,ANA>Todd hurt his back and couldn't work.

511
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,540
<19-6,ANA>银行要没收他的机器  所以
<19-6,ANA>The bank wanted to take away his business, so...

512
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,270
<19-6,ANA>他去找一个邻居
<19-6,ANA>He borrowed some money

513
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,480
<19-6,ANA>借了一笔钱
<19-6,ANA>from a guy in the neighborhood.

514
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,810
<19-6,ANA>那个人
<19-6,ANA>This guy...

515
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,480
<19-6,ANA>不是什么好人
<19-6,ANA>He's no good.

516
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,920
<19-7,BECKETT>他有威胁托德吗
<19-7,BECKETT>Did he threaten Todd?

517
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,790
<19-8,ANA>托德在努力还钱  但没有按期还清
<19-8,ANA>Todd was making payments, but he fell behind.

518
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,050
<19-8,ANA>几个星期前
<19-8,ANA>A couple weeks back,

519
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,170
<19-8,ANA>那个人拿着把枪到我们家来
<19-8,ANA>the man came to the house with a gun.

520
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,150
<19-8,ANA>他说若托德不还回欠款的话
<19-8,ANA>He said he was gonna kill Todd

521
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,680
<19-8,ANA>就要杀了他
<19-8,ANA>if he didn't pay back what he owed.

522
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,630
<20-1,DEAN>我是借钱给他了  15000美元  有问题吗
<20-1,DEAN>I loaned him money. 15 g's. So what?

523
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,570
<20-2,BECKETT>卡宾诺先生  有目击者说
<20-2,BECKETT>Mr. Carbino, we have a witness

524
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,200
<20-2,BECKETT>-你曾威胁要杀了他  -又怎样呢
<20-2,BECKETT>- who says that you threatened to kill him.  - So?

525
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,840
<20-4,CASTLE>结果他现在死了
<20-4,CASTLE>So now he's dead.

526
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,490
<20-4,CASTLE>不用你说  我自己看得到
<20-4,CASTLE>Yeah, I could see that.

527
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,310
<20-5,DEAN>听着警探小姐  首先
<20-5,DEAN>Look, detective, first off,

528
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,710
<20-5,DEAN>15000美元不值得我去杀人
<20-5,DEAN>15 g's is not an amount of money worth killing for.

529
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,550
<20-5,DEAN>除非是到了穷途末路的时候
<20-5,DEAN>Not unless you've exhausted other avenues,

530
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,080
<20-5,DEAN>但我没有
<20-5,DEAN>to which I had not.

531
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
<20-5,DEAN>其次  更重要的是
<20-5,DEAN>And secondly, and more to the point,

532
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,340
<20-5,DEAN>你们的死者
<20-5,DEAN>your boy here,

533
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,990
<20-5,DEAN>已经连本带利的把钱还给我了
<20-5,DEAN>he paid me back the entire sum plus interest.

534
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,620
<20-6,BECKETT>你以为我会信吗
<20-6,BECKETT>Do you really expect me to believe that?

535
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,560
<20-7,DEAN>我知道你不会  宝贝
<20-7,DEAN>No, I don't, sweetheart.

536
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,700
<20-7,DEAN>但事实就是如此
<20-7,DEAN>But that don't mean it ain't true.

537
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,320
<21-1,ESPOSITO>他的不在场证明已经核实了
<21-1,ESPOSITO>His alibi checks.

538
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,560
<21-1,ESPOSITO>他昨天一天都在新泽西州
<21-1,ESPOSITO>He was in Jersey all day yesterday,

539
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,440
<21-1,ESPOSITO>和情人在短山市购物
<21-1,ESPOSITO>shopping at Short Hills with the missus.

540
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,220
<21-2,BECKETT>哇  多幸运的女孩啊
<21-2,BECKETT>Wow, lucky girl.

541
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,770
<21-3,RYAN>那也不代表不是他干的啊
<21-3,RYAN>Doesn't mean he didn't do it.

542
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,610
<21-3,RYAN>他可以雇个杀手
<21-3,RYAN>He coulda hired someone.

543
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,020
<21-4,BECKETT>是可以雇杀手干掉麦卡奇
<21-4,BECKETT>Yeah, to kill Mccutchin,

544
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,410
<21-4,BECKETT>但为什么连玛雅和克洛伊也要杀呢
<21-4,BECKETT>but why Maya and Chloe?

545
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,170
<21-5,RYAN>也许他们目睹了杀人现场
<21-5,RYAN>Maybe they witnessed the hit.

546
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,230
<21-6,ESPOSITO>或者是他们联合贷的款
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Maybe they cosigned the loan.

547
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,090
<21-7,CASTLE>有麦卡奇的财务报表吗
<21-7,CASTLE>Do we have Mccutchin's financials?

548
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,390
<21-8,ESPOSITO>很快就可以找到  要那个干嘛
<21-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they should all be up shortly. Why?

549
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,090
<21-9,CASTLE>因为卡宾诺说
<21-9,CASTLE>Uh, well, Carbino said that, uh,

550
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,660
<21-9,CASTLE>麦卡奇已经把钱连本带利全还给了他
<21-9,CASTLE>Mccutchin paid off his debt in full plus interest.

551
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,870
<21-9,CASTLE>我在想  对于经营自动贩卖生意的人来说
<21-9,CASTLE>I was just thinking, that's a lot of money...

552
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,080
<21-9,CASTLE>那可是一个不小的数目
<21-9,CASTLE>for a guy in the vending machine business.

553
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,910
<21-9,CASTLE>我就怀疑
<21-9,CASTLE>And I thought,

554
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,940
<21-9,CASTLE>他从哪儿弄的钱呢
<21-9,CASTLE>maybe, where did that money come from?

555
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,630
<21-9,CASTLE>知道吗
<21-9,CASTLE>You know,

556
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,220
<22-1,BECKETT>麦卡奇的所有帐户都透支了
<22-1,BECKETT>all of Mccutchin's accounts were overdrawn,

557
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,620
<22-1,BECKETT>但两周前
<22-1,BECKETT>and then suddenly, 2 weeks ago,

558
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,600
<22-1,BECKETT>突然有了9500美元的存款进账
<22-1,BECKETT>$9,500 appears in his savings.

559
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:53,870
<22-2,ESPOSITO>两周前
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Two weeks ago?

560
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,100
<22-3,BECKETT>对  是  7号
<22-3,BECKETT>Yeah. On the, uh, the 7th.

561
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,840
<22-4,ESPOSITO>在同一天
<22-4,ESPOSITO>There was a deposit

562
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,090
<22-4,ESPOSITO>玛雅·桑托丽的帐户上
<22-4,ESPOSITO>made in Maya Santori's account

563
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,400
<22-4,ESPOSITO>也有同样多的钱进账
<22-4,ESPOSITO>on the 7th for the same amount.

564
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,150
<22-5,BECKETT>克洛伊·惠特曼呢
<22-5,BECKETT>What about Chloe Whitman?

565
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,970
<22-6,RYAN>7号存款9500美元
<22-6,RYAN>$9,500 deposited on the 7th.

566
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,850
<22-7,BECKETT>也就是说
<22-7,BECKETT>Which means they were

567
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,570
<22-7,BECKETT>他们有相同的资金来源
<22-7,BECKETT>all receiving money from the same source.

568
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,240
<22-8,CASTLE>而且花在同一个地方
<22-8,CASTLE>And spending it in the same place.

569
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,930
<22-8,CASTLE>玛雅·桑托丽和克洛伊·惠特曼
<22-8,CASTLE>Both Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman

570
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,060
<22-8,CASTLE>都曾在一个名叫
<22-8,CASTLE>had charges on their credit card

571
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,930
<22-8,CASTLE>K.C.B.C.的地方用信用卡消费过
<22-8,CASTLE>for a place called K.C.B.C.

572

<22-8,CASTLE>都是9号和16号去的
<22-8,CASTLE>Both of them on the 9th and the 16th,

573
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,730
<22-8,CASTLE>而且都只有少量消费  不到20美元
<22-8,CASTLE>Both of them small amounts, less than 20 bucks.

574
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,080
<22-9,BECKETT>麦卡奇也是
<22-9,BECKETT>Same thing with Mccutchin.

575
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,000
<22-10,ESPOSITO>那是他们碰面的某个餐厅吗
<22-10,ESPOSITO>The restaurant where they met?

576
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,180
<22-11,BECKETT>好了  给银行打个电话
<22-11,BECKETT>All right, call up the bank.

577
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,580
<22-11,BECKETT>看能不能帮忙查到
<22-11,BECKETT>Let's see if they can help us track

578
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,950
<22-11,BECKETT>是谁给他们存的钱
<22-11,BECKETT>who made those deposits.

579
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,590
<22-11,BECKETT>还要去联系一下信用卡公司
<22-11,BECKETT>And I'd like to contact the credit card company

580
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,770
<22-12,RYAN>查一下这个 K.C.B.C.到底是什么地方
<22-12,RYAN>to find out what this K.C.B.C. Is.

581
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,140
<22-12,RYAN>马上去办
<22-12,RYAN>On it.

582
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,310
<22-13,BECKETT>别以为这样就算你赢了
<22-13,BECKETT>Don't think that this means that you won the bet.

583
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,500
<22-13,BECKETT>我们只知道他们之间有关联
<22-13,BECKETT>All we know is that they are connected.

584
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,350
<22-13,BECKETT>但还不知道是何种关联
<22-13,BECKETT>We still don't know how.

585
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:50,800
<22-14,CASTLE>人家也很想你
<22-14,CASTLE>I missed you, too.

586
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,940
<22-14,CASTLE>嘿
<22-14,CASTLE>Hey.

587
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,550
<23-1,RYAN>坏消息  根据银行记录
<23-1,RYAN>Bad news. According to the banks,

588
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,050
<23-1,RYAN>被害者是用现金进行存款的
<23-1,RYAN>our victims' deposits were made in cash.

589
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,440
<23-1,RYAN>不可能查到支付信息
<23-1,RYAN>There's no way to trace the payments.

590
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,720
<23-1,RYAN>而且由于存款不足10000美元
<23-1,RYAN>And since the deposits were less than $10,000,

591
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,320
<23-1,RYAN>所以也没有上报国税局
<23-1,RYAN>there was no report made to the I.R.S.

592
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,470
<23-2,BECKETT>也就是说被害者们
<23-2,BECKETT>Which means that our victims

593
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,170
<23-2,BECKETT>很有可能在进行某种非法活动
<23-2,BECKETT>were most likely involved in something iegal.

594
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,970
<23-3,CASTLE>正如你所说的  从"被枪杀"的事实中也可看出
<23-3,CASTLE>Just so you know, I got that from "Shot to death."

595
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,490
<23-3,CASTLE>然后呢
<23-3,CASTLE>So?

596
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,040
<23-4,RYAN>然后
<23-4,RYAN>So...

597
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,060
<23-4,RYAN>哪些不法活动要用到自动贩卖机
<23-4,RYAN>What illegal activity involves vending machines,

598
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,530
<23-4,RYAN>-艺术家和高中老师呢  -谁知道呢
<23-4,RYAN>- an artist and a high school teacher?  - I know.

599
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
<23-5,CASTLE>就连我脑袋里
<23-5,CASTLE>Even the stuff I'm making up

600
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,950
<23-5,CASTLE>编的那些理论都讲不通了
<23-5,CASTLE>in my head doesn't make sense.

601
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,480
<23-6,ESPOSITO>我和信用卡公司谈过了
<23-6,ESPOSITO>I talked to the credit card companies.

602
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,370
<23-6,ESPOSITO>K.C.B.C.通过
<23-6,ESPOSITO>K.C.B.C. Bills through

603
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,340
<23-6,ESPOSITO>网上付款的方式受理账单
<23-6,ESPOSITO>an internet card processing service.

604
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,880
<23-6,ESPOSITO>没有文档记录
<23-6,ESPOSITO>There's no address on file.

605
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,180
<23-7,BECKETT>不能追踪网址吗
<23-7,BECKETT>We can't even track it down?

606
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,160
<23-5,CASTLE>我可没那样说
<23-5,CASTLE>I didn't say that.

607
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,070
<23-6,ESPOSITO>虽然没有文档记录
<23-6,ESPOSITO>There's no address on file,

608
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,390
<23-8,ESPOSITO>但每次刷卡交易
<23-8,ESPOSITO>but they do register the I.S.P.

609
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,300
<23-8,ESPOSITO>都有进行网上注册
<23-8,ESPOSITO>of every swiped card transaction that goes through.

610
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,230
<23-8,ESPOSITO>所以我让技术员进行了追踪
<23-8,ESPOSITO>So I had tech track it down.

611
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,700
<23-8,ESPOSITO>收款人是在这里进行操作的
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Whoever ran those charges did it from this address.

612
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:55,850
<23-8,ESPOSITO>我来就行了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>I got this.

613
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,910
<23-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  上路
<23-9,BECKETT>Castle, road trip.

614
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,040
<23-9,BECKETT>谢你了
<23-9,BECKETT>Uh, thank you.

615
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,050
<24-1,CASTLE>你确定是这里吗
<24-1,CASTLE>You sure this is the place?

616
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,560
<24-2,BECKETT>你问我我问谁去
<24-2,BECKETT>As sure as you are.

617
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,050
<24-3,CASTLE>这里可不像是刷卡消费的地方
<24-3,CASTLE>This doesn't look like a credit card kind of place.

618
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,550
<24-3,CASTLE>而更像是
<24-3,CASTLE>This looks more like

619
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,550
<24-3,CASTLE>劫匪犯案的好据点
<24-3,CASTLE>a "Get shot and robbed" kind of place.

<24-3,CASTLE>有这个
<24-3,CASTLE>There's...

<24-5,BECKETT>克洛伊的手上有这个数字
<24-5,BECKETT>That was the number on Chloe's hand.

<24-6,BECKETT>她来过这里
<24-6,BECKETT>She was here.

624
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,780
<25-1,CASTLE>这里  简直就是供应酒水的马戏团啊
<25-1,CASTLE>This place--it's like the circus with alcohol.

625
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,300
<25-1,CASTLE>我怎么以前从没来过呢
<25-1,CASTLE>How have I never been here before?

626
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,190
<25-2,BECKETT>这就让你兴奋了吗
<25-2,BECKETT>You think this is crazy,

627
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,770
<25-2,BECKETT>你该见识一下我曾经去过的俱乐部
<25-2,BECKETT>You should see some of the clubs I've been to.

628
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,450
<25-3,BARTENDER>需要点什么
<25-3,BARTENDER>What can I get you?

<26-5,KITTY>她算得上是老顾客
<26-5,KITTY>She was more of a patron.

642
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,910
<26-5,KITTY>是来寻找灵感的
<26-5,KITTY>She came for inspiration.

<26-9,BECKETT>我们只知道他们都来过这里
<26-9,BECKETT>the only connection that we can find is this club.

649
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,000
<26-10,KITTY>你不会认为是这里的人
<26-10,KITTY>Well, you don't think someone

<26-12,KITTY>to get tattoos.

656
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,300
<26-12,KITTY>那是我白天的工作
<26-12,KITTY>My day job.

657
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,120
<26-13,BECKETT>他们三个经常在一起吗
<26-13,BECKETT>Did the three of them spend a lot of time together?

658
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,850
<26-14,EARL>没有经常在一起  和其他人差不多
<26-14,EARL>No more so than anybody else.

659
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,430
<26-15,CASTLE>这里有谁和他们来往比较密切的吗
<26-15,CASTLE>Did they spend a lot of time with anyone else here?

660
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,690
<26-16,KITTY>我没看到
<26-16,KITTY>Not that I noticed.

661
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,810
<26-17,BECKETT>你们有常客的电子名单吗
<26-17,BECKETT>Do you have a mailing list of your regulars?

662
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,700
<26-18,EARL>-有  我可以给你一份  -谢谢
<26-18,EARL>- Yes. I can get a copy if you want.  - Yes,

663
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,870
<26-19,BECKETT>我还需要一份这里所有员工
<26-19,BECKETT>and I'll also neea list of all of your employees

664
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,260
<26-19,BECKETT>以及剧团其他人员的名单
<26-19,BECKETT>and any other members of your troupe.

665
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,820
<26-21,BECKETT>-没问题  -你能想到他们三个之间
<26-21,BECKETT>-Of course.  -Can you think of any other connection

666
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,680
<26-21,BECKETT>除此之外的其他关联吗
<26-21,BECKETT>between the three of them?

667
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,620
<26-22,KITTY>曾经 曾经发生过一件事
<26-22,KITTY>Well, there w-- there was the incident.

668
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,420
<26-23,EARL>几个星期前
<26-23,EARL>A couple of weeks ago,

669
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,560
<26-23,EARL>克洛伊的男朋友来过
<26-23,EARL>Chloe's boyfriend came around.

670
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,980
<26-23,EARL>很显然  他不喜欢她在这里跳舞
<26-23,EARL>Apparently, he didn't like her dancing here.

671
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,580
<26-23,EARL>他的反应有点激烈
<26-23,EARL>He got a little rough.

672
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,190
<26-23,EARL>玛雅和托德都插手了
<26-23,EARL>Both Maya and Todd intervened.

673
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:12,910
<26-24,KITTY>伊万喝醉了
<26-24,KITTY>Evan was drunk,

674
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,810
<26-24,KITTY>说了很多疯话
<26-24,KITTY>Yeiling all kinds of crazy stuff.

675
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,570
<26-25,BECKETT>什么话
<26-25,BECKETT>What kind of stuff?

676
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,450
<26-26,KITTY>我知道你在做什么  我清楚得很
<26-26,KITTY>"I know what you're doing. I know all about it."

677
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,060
<26-26,KITTY>我猜他是以为她在和别人乱搞
<26-26,KITTY>I guess he thought she was screwing someone else.

678
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,290
<27-1,EVAN>好吧  那天晚上我是跟踪克洛伊到俱乐部去了
<27-1,EVAN>Okay, so I followed Chloe to the club that night,

679
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,300
<27-1,EVAN>那是因为她那时候行为怪异  很神秘
<27-1,EVAN>But only because she was acting weird, secretive,

680
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,360
<27-1,EVAN>我以为她在和别人约会
<27-1,EVAN>And I thought she was seeing another guy.

681
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,480
<27-2,BECKETT>墨菲先生  为什么之前你没说呢
<27-2,BECKETT>Mr. Murphy, why didn't you tell us this before?

682
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,840
<27-3,EVAN>说我和女朋友吵过架
<27-3,EVAN>That I'd been fighting with my girlfriend,

683
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,970
<27-3,EVAN>还威胁过她  我很清楚警察是怎么办案的
<27-3,EVAN>that I'd threatened her? I know how cops work.

684
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,820
<27-4,CASTLE>当你发现其他死者
<27-4,CASTLE>And when you found out about the other victims,

685
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,450
<27-4,CASTLE>也都是俱乐部成员时呢
<27-4,CASTLE>that they were all there at the club?

686
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,180
<27-5,EVAN>我没有杀她
<27-5,EVAN>I didn't kill her.

687
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,320
<27-5,EVAN>我没有杀害任何人
<27-5,EVAN>I didn't kill any of them.

688
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,810
<27-5,EVAN>要是你会怎么做
<27-5,EVAN>What would you have done?

689
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,680
<27-6,BECKETT>我会找出杀人凶手
<27-6,BECKETT>I would try to help find her killer.

690
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,620
<27-7,EVAN>若我那时告诉你们这件事
<27-7,EVAN>But if I had told you then what you know now,

691
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,720
<27-7,EVAN>你们还会怀疑其他人吗
<27-7,EVAN>would you have looked any further than me?

692
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,650
<27-8,BECKETT>墨菲先生  克洛伊账上的钱
<27-8,BECKETT>Mr. Murphy, the money in Chloe's account,

693
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,620
<27-8,BECKETT>是从哪儿来的
<27-8,BECKETT>where did it come from?

694
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,290
<27-9,EVAN>什么钱
<27-9,EVAN>What money?

695
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,030
<28-1,CASTLE>他承认有过争吵和威胁
<28-1,CASTLE>So he admits to the fights and the threats,

696
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,160
<28-1,CASTLE>但却坚持对钱的事一无所知
<28-1,CASTLE>but he claims not to know anything about the money...

697
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,430
<28-2,BECKETT>也否认知道死者除了那天晚上的事之外
<28-2,BECKETT>Or how our victims are connected

698
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,400
<28-2,BECKETT>还有什么别的关联
<28-2,BECKETT>other than the events of that night.

699
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,570
<28-3,CASTLE>你相信他吗
<28-3,CASTLE>Do you believe him?

700
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,700
<28-3,CASTLE>我怎么想不重要
<28-3,CASTLE>It doesn't matter what I believe.

701
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,470
<28-4,BECKETT>他是嫌疑犯  嘿  莱恩
<28-4,BECKETT>He's a viable suspect. Hey, ryan.

702
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,140
<28-4,BECKETT>我要你去申请一张
<28-4,BECKETT>I need you to get a search warrant

703
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,210
<28-4,BECKETT>伊万·墨菲家的搜查令
<28-4,BECKETT>for Evan Murphy's place.

704
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,050
<28-4,BECKETT>还有  埃斯波西托  你那边怎么样
<28-4,BECKETT>And, Esposito, how are things going over there?

705
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,780
<28-5,ESPOSITO>我查了一下俱乐部名单里有前科的人
<28-5,ESPOSITO>We ran the club's mailing list for people with priors.

706
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,160
<28-5,ESPOSITO>暂时只查到这几个
<28-5,ESPOSITO>These are the ones that have popped so far.

707
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,190
<28-6,BECKETT>好  查一下他们和受害人有什么关系
<28-6,BECKETT>All right, run 'em for any connections with our vics.

708
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,980
<28-7,ESPOSITO>马上去办
<28-7,ESPOSITO>Right on.

709
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,660
<28-8,BECKETT>什么
<28-8,BECKETT>What?

710
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,280
<28-9,CASTLE>这张脸很眼熟
<28-9,CASTLE>I've seen this guy's face.

711
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,630
<28-10,CASTLE>是同一个人
<28-10,CASTLE>That's the same guy.

712
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,140
<28-11,BECKETT>玛雅认识他
<28-11,BECKETT>Maya knew him.

713
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,610
<28-11,BECKETT>兰德·道约尔
<28-11,BECKETT>"Xander Doyle."

714
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,840
<28-11,BECKETT>非法持枪罪  意图散布武器
<28-11,BECKETT>Weapons charges, conspiracy to distribute,

715
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,710
<28-11,BECKETT>而且很明显  他住在包厘街
<28-11,BECKETT>And apparently, he lives in the bowery.

716
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,430
<28-12,CASTLE>我敢打赌
<28-12,CASTLE>How much you want to bet

717
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,450
<28-12,CASTLE>玛雅在麦卡奇被杀后
<28-12,CASTLE>Maya was on her way to see him

718
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
<28-12,CASTLE>正要去见道约尔
<28-12,CASTLE>after Mccutchin's murder?

719
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,860
<29-1,XANDER>对  当然  我认识玛雅
<29-1,XANDER>Yeah, sure. I knew Maya.

720
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,160
<29-1,XANDER>我们几个月前在俱乐部认识
<29-1,XANDER>I met her at the club a few months back.

721
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,660
<29-2,BECKETT>你们是什么关系
<29-2,BECKETT>and what was the nature of your relationship?

722
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,010
<29-3,XANDER>她说她喜欢我的样子
<29-3,XANDER>She said she liked the way I looked.

723
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,460
<29-3,XANDER>接下来你也猜得到
<29-3,XANDER>You know how it goes.

724
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,560
<29-4,CASTLE>你最后一次见到她是什么时候
<29-4,CASTLE>When was the last time you saw her?

725
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,270
<29-5,BECKETT>道约尔先生  我们有证据显示
<29-5,BECKETT>Mr. Doyle, we have evidence that indicates

726
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,720
<29-5,BECKETT>玛雅死的那天曾和你见过面
<29-5,BECKETT>That Maya came to see you the day she died.

727
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,240
<29-6,XANDER>她说她有麻烦了
<29-6,XANDER>Look, she said she was in trouble.

728
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,040
<29-7,BECKETT>-她需要我的帮助  -什么样的麻烦
<29-7,BECKETT>- She needed my help. - What kind of trouble?

729
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,010
<29-8,XANDER>她不肯说
<29-8,XANDER>She wouldn't say.

730
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,990
<29-8,XANDER>一定是有人在找她麻烦
<29-8,XANDER>Someone must have been after her.

731
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,960
<29-9,BECKETT>为什么这样说
<29-9,BECKETT>And why would you say that?

732
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,950
<29-10,XANDER>因为她来找我的原因
<29-10,XANDER>'cause the reason she came to see me is,

733
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,250
<29-10,XANDER>是因为她要借枪
<29-10,XANDER>she wanted to borrow a gun.

734
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,180
<29-11,CASTLE>这能解释为什么她有武器
<29-11,CASTLE>that's why she was armed.

735
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,070
<29-11,CASTLE>她看见麦卡奇的下场
<29-11,CASTLE>She saw what happened to Mccutchin.

736
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,230
<29-11,CASTLE>认为下一个就到自己
<29-11,CASTLE>She figured she'd be next.

737
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,190
<29-12,BECKETT>道约尔先生  有任何迹象表明
<29-12,BECKETT>Mr. Doyle, did Maya give you any indication

738
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,090
<29-12,BECKETT>玛雅可能卷入什么事情吗
<29-12,BECKETT>As to what she might have been involved in?

739
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,380
<29-13,XANDER>没有  如果让我猜的话
<29-13,XANDER>No. If I was a betting man...

740
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,150
<29-13,XANDER>几周前我在街上遇见玛雅
<29-13,XANDER>I ran into Maya a few weeks ago on the street.

741
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,330
<29-13,XANDER>她给了我一个拥抱  我闻到了
<29-13,XANDER>She gave me a hug. I could smell it.

742
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,850
<29-14,BECKETT>你闻到什么
<29-14,BECKETT>You could smell what?

743
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,660
<29-15,XANDER>恶心的气味  涂料稀释剂  丙酮
<29-15,XANDER>That sick smell--paint thinner, acetone,

744
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,230
<29-15,XANDER>漂白剂  我有个兄弟闻起来跟她一样
<29-15,XANDER>bleach. I got a buddy who smells like that.

745
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,110
<29-15,XANDER>你知道他干什么的吗
<29-15,XANDER>You know what he does?

746
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,670
<29-15,XANDER>他制造冰毒
<29-15,XANDER>He makes meth.

747
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,810
<30-1,CASTLE>这太明显了
<30-1,CASTLE>it's so obvious.

748
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,370
<30-1,CASTLE>我不敢相信我没早点想到
<30-1,CASTLE>I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner.

749
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,850
<30-2,BECKETT>你真的觉得是冰毒吗
<30-2,BECKETT>Do you really think it was meth?

750
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,670
<30-3,CASTLE>这是唯一合理的解释了
<30-3,CASTLE>It's the only thing that makes any sense.

751
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,590
<30-3,CASTLE>受害者全都有财政上的困难
<30-3,CASTLE>All of our victims were struggling financially.

752
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,930
<30-3,CASTLE>某天晚上  俱乐部关门后
<30-3,CASTLE>One night after the club closes, they're all together

753
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,250
<30-3,CASTLE>他们一起谈论缺钱的问题
<30-3,CASTLE>Talking about their money woes

754
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,290
<30-3,CASTLE>直到我们的高中化学老师开玩笑
<30-3,CASTLE>Until our high school chemistry teacher cracks a smile

755
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,390
<30-3,CASTLE>说  咱们随时可以自制冰毒嘛
<30-3,CASTLE>And says, "Well, we could always make meth."

756
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,000
<30-3,CASTLE>但其他人没有笑
<30-3,CASTLE>But the others don't laugh.

757
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,800
<30-3,CASTLE>他们说  对  我们可以做冰毒
<30-3,CASTLE>They say, "Yeah, we could make meth."

758
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,060
<30-3,CASTLE>就像那部电视剧一样[详见《Weeds单身毒妈》]
<30-3,CASTLE>Just like that cable show.

759
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,770
<31-1,LANIE>听我的吧  就是毒品
<31-1,LANIE>I'm telling you, it's drugs.

760
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,340
<31-2,BECKETT>-不是毒品  -你确定吗
<31-2,BECKETT>- It's not drugs. - Are you sure?

761
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,710
<31-3,LANIE>是  那家伙说的化学物品是对的
<31-3,LANIE>Yes, and your guy was right about the chemicals.

762
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,640
<31-3,LANIE>我在三具尸体上都找到漂白剂
<31-3,LANIE>I found trace amounts of bleach, acetone,

763
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,650
<31-3,LANIE>丙酮  氯化钠还有氨的痕迹
<31-3,LANIE>Sodium chloride and ammonia on all three bodies.

764
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,510
<31-4,CASTLE>你怎么知道这不是毒品
<31-4,CASTLE>So how can you tell it's not drugs?

765
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,650
<31-5,LANIE>因为少了些东西
<31-5,LANIE>Because of what's missing.

766
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,590
<31-5,LANIE>如果死者想要在家烹制冰毒
<31-5,LANIE>If your guys had been cooking up meth

767
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,190
<31-5,LANIE>或者任何自制毒品
<31-5,LANIE>Or any other street-lab drugs,

768
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,120
<31-5,LANIE>一定会有其他的化学成分
<31-5,LANIE>There would be other substances present,

769
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,630
<31-5,LANIE>更别说会有一部分毒品成品的残余了
<31-5,LANIE>Not to mention the trace amounts of the finished product.

770
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,060
<31-5,LANIE>这说明  他们肯定在筹划什么
<31-5,LANIE>That being said, they finitely were up to something.

771
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,560
<31-5,LANIE>嗯
<31-5,LANIE>Hmm.

772
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,210
<31-6,BECKETT>-贝克特  -嘿  我是莱恩
<31-6,BECKETT>- Beckett. - Hey, it's Ryan.

773
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,270
<31-7,RYAN>伊万·墨菲家的搜查证
<31-7,RYAN>That search warrant on Evan Murphy's place?

774
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,730
<31-7,RYAN>没白申请
<31-7,RYAN>It paid off.

775
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,040
<31-7,RYAN>我们找到了凶器
<31-7,RYAN>We found the murder weapon.

776
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:04,540
<32-1,EVAN>我对天发誓  我从来没看见过这东西
<32-1,EVAN>I swear to god, I've never seen that before in my life.

777
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,910
<32-2,BECKETT>那它为什么会在你家
<32-2,BECKETT>Then what was it doing in your place?

778
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,430
<32-4,BECKETT>-我不知道  -你跟踪克洛伊到俱乐部
<32-4,BECKETT>- I don't know! - What really happened the night

779
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,640
<32-4,BECKETT>那天晚上到底发生什么事了
<32-4,BECKETT>that you followed Chloe To the club?

780
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,350
<32-5,EVAN>我告诉过你  我们吵架了
<32-5,EVAN>I told you, we fought.

781
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,910
<32-6,BECKETT>为了什么  别说是因为外遇
<32-6,BECKETT>About what? And do not say the affair.

782
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,020
<32-6,BECKETT>你们四个到底在盘算什么
<32-6,BECKETT>What were the four of you into?

783
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,740
<32-6,BECKETT>伊万  你们是什么关系
<32-6,BECKETT>Evan, what's the connection?

784
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,690
<32-6,BECKETT>你为什么要杀他们
<32-6,BECKETT>Why did you kill them?

785
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,770
<32-7,EVAN>我要律师
<32-7,EVAN>I want a lawyer.

786
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,890
<32-7,EVAN>律师来之前我什么都不会说
<32-7,EVAN>I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer.

787
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,050
<33-1,RYAN>律师办公室接到通知
<33-1,RYAN>P.D.'s office has been notified.

788
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,840
<33-1,RYAN>他们正派人过来
<33-1,RYAN>They're sending someone over.

789
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,130
<33-2,BECKETT>通知地方检察官看能否帮我们和律师谈谈
<33-2,BECKETT>Okay, notify the D.A. Maybe they can cut us a deal

790
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,110
<33-2,BECKETT>让我们弄清楚到底发生什么事
<33-2,BECKETT>and help us figure out what was really going on.

791
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,370
<33-3,CASTLE>我知道这个表情
<33-3,CASTLE>I know that look.

792
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,840
<33-4,BECKETT>什么表情
<33-4,BECKETT>What look?

793
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,410
<33-5,CASTLE>"有点儿东西不对劲" 的表情
<33-5,CASTLE>That "Something doesn't add up" Look.

794
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,420
<33-6,BECKETT>凶器的实验室报告有点不对劲
<33-6,BECKETT>It's just the lab report on the murder weapon.

795
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,450
<33-7,CASTLE>怎么了
<33-7,CASTLE>What about it?

796
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,300
<33-8,BECKETT>他们找不到任何指纹
<33-8,BECKETT>They didn't find any fingerprints.

797
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,520
<33-9,CASTLE>他大概已经擦掉了
<33-9,CASTLE>He probably wiped it down.

798
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,910
<33-10,BECKETT>他既然把指纹擦了
<33-10,BECKETT>Why would he wipe it down

799
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,990
<33-10,BECKETT>那干嘛还要留着枪
<33-10,BECKETT>if he was gonna hang on to it?

800
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,670
<33-11,CASTLE>也许他想丢的
<33-11,CASTLE>Maybe he was going to ditch it

801
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,120
<33-11,CASTLE>只不过没找到合适的机会
<33-11,CASTLE>but didn't get around to it.

802
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,120
<33-12,BECKETT>他会做的第一件事就是把凶器丢掉
<33-12,BECKETT>Ditching it would be the first thing that he would do.

803
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,260
<33-13,CASTLE>或者他觉得还有用处
<33-13,CASTLE>Maybe he thought he still needed it.

804
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,500
<33-14,BECKETT>-再去杀人  -或者保护自己
<33-14,BECKETT>- To kill someone else? - Or protect himself.

805
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,670
<33-15,CASTLE>嘿  贝克特
<33-15,CASTLE>hey, yo, Beckett.

806
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,240
<33-16,ESPOSITO>伊万的财政报告出来了
<33-16,ESPOSITO>Financials came back on your boy Evan.

<33-16,ESPOSITO>沒什么异常账目
<33-16,ESPOSITO>There's no unusual activity.

808
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,480
<33-17,CASTLE>或者这就是动机
<33-17,CASTLE>Maybe that was his motive.

809
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,950
<33-17,CASTLE>不管他们在干什么
<33-17,CASTLE>Whatever it was they were up to,

810
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,680
<33-17,CASTLE>他没拿到钱
<33-17,CASTLE>he didn't get his cut.

811
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,460
<33-18,BECKETT>那些钱去哪里了
<33-18,BECKETT>But what was his cut?

812
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,340
<33-18,BECKETT>我是说  他们到底在干些什么
<33-18,BECKETT>I mean, what the hell were they into?

813
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,230
<33-18,BECKETT>这简直就是个冷笑话  雕刻家
<33-18,BECKETT>It's like a bad joke-- a sculptor,

814
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,220
<33-18,BECKETT>自动售卖机推销员和化学老师
<33-18,BECKETT>A vending machine salesman and a chemistry teacher

815
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
<33-18,BECKETT>走进一间滑稽剧酒吧
<33-18,BECKETT>walk into a burlesque bar.

816
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,160
<33-19,CASTLE>对  虽然这个笑话完全没有笑点
<33-19,CASTLE>Yeah, only we don't have a punch line.

817
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,050
<33-20,BECKETT>唯一的笑点就是
<33-20,BECKETT>Other than they made

818
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,090
<33-20,BECKETT>他们大赚一笔之后却有钱没命花了
<33-20,BECKETT>a bunch of money and got themselves killed.

819
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,140
<33-21,CASTLE>大赚一笔
<33-21,CASTLE>"Made a bunch of money."

820
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,260
<33-22,BECKETT>什么
<33-22,BECKETT>What?

821
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,770
<33-23,CASTLE>一个金属雕刻家  一个化学家
<33-23,CASTLE>A sculptor who works with metal, a chemist...

822
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,270
<33-23,CASTLE>还有自动售卖机技工
<33-23,CASTLE>And a vending machine operator...

823
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,340
<33-23,CASTLE>我想我知道受害者在干什么了
<33-23,CASTLE>I think I know what our victims were up to.

824
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,600
<33-23,CASTLE>克洛伊的钱包还在吗
<33-23,CASTLE>Do we still have chloe's purse?

825
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,670
<33-23,CASTLE>哇
<33-23,CASTLE>Whoa.

826
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,880
<33-24,BECKETT>你找什么呢
<33-24,BECKETT>What are you looking for?

827
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,030
<33-25,CASTLE>啊哈
<33-25,CASTLE>Aha!

828
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,920
<33-25,CASTLE>看一下这些钞票上的序号
<33-25,CASTLE>Take a look at the serial numbers on those bills.

829
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,860
<33-26,BECKETT>一模一样
<33-26,BECKETT>They're the same.

830
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,910
<33-27,CASTLE>这些钞票全是1998年之前的
<33-27,CASTLE>These bills are all pre-1998.

831
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,700
<33-28,BECKETT>就在货币被重新设计之前
<33-28,BECKETT>That's before they redesigned the currency.

832
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,990
<33-29,CASTLE>这就是笑点了
<33-29,CASTLE>That's our punch line.

833
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,220
<33-29,CASTLE>他们就是因此聚到一块儿的
<33-29,CASTLE>That's how these people are connected.

834
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,100
<33-29,CASTLE>在造假币的环节中
<33-29,CASTLE>In counterfeiting,

835
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,850
<33-29,CASTLE>最难伪造的就是纸张
<33-29,CASTLE>the hardest thing to make is the paper.

836
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
<33-29,CASTLE>但他们有足够的纸
<33-29,CASTLE>But they had all the paper they needed.

837
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,950
<33-29,CASTLE>他们有取之不竭的一块纸币
<33-29,CASTLE>They had an unlimited supply of $1 bills.

838
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,290
<33-30,BECKETT>从自动贩卖机里弄来的
<33-30,BECKETT>From the vending machines.

839
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,420
<33-31,CASTLE>那些受害者身上找到的化学物
<33-31,CASTLE>And those chemicals we found on our victims' bodies...

840
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,390
<33-32,BECKETT>是用来漂洗一元纸币
<33-32,BECKETT>Were used to whitewash the singles

841
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,430
<33-32,BECKETT>做成空白的钞票
<33-32,BECKETT>In order to make blank bank notes.

842
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,100
<33-33,CASTLE>这个步骤需要一名化学家
<33-33,CASTLE>A procedure requiring the expertise of a chemist.

843
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,300
<33-33,CASTLE>那他们用空白的钞票做什么
<33-33,CASTLE>And what do counterfeiters do with blank bank notes?

844
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,000
<33-34,BECKETT>印上更大的面额
<33-34,BECKETT>Print larger denominations,

845
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,000
<33-34,BECKETT>那他们就需要一个金属压板
<33-34,BECKETT>For which they need a metal press plate.

846
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,200
<33-35,CASTLE>没有比雕刻家更适合的了
<33-35,CASTLE>And who better to provide that than a sculptor?

847
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:54,930
<33-35,CASTLE>那么
<33-35,CASTLE>So...

<33-36,BECKETT>金属板  纸
<33-36,BECKETT>Plates, paper...

849
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,950
<33-36,BECKETT>只剩下一种原料了
<33-36,BECKETT>There's only one missing ingredient.

850

854
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,180
<34-3,BECKETT>要去哪里啊
<34-3,BECKETT>Going somewhere?

855
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,670
<34-3,BECKETT>把手举起来
<34-3,BECKETT>Let me see your hands.

856
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,810
<34-3,BECKETT>离开那些袋子  向前走
<34-3,BECKETT>Step away from the bags and walk forward.

857
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,940
<34-4,RYAN>没错了  都是假的
<34-4,RYAN>Yeah, they're fake.

858
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,570
<34-5,KITTY>你们怎么怀疑我的
<34-5,KITTY>What gave me away?

859
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,280
<34-6,CASTLE>缺少的原料
<34-6,CASTLE>The missing ingredient.

860
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,780
<34-6,CASTLE>墨水
<34-6,CASTLE>Ink.

861
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,370
<34-6,CASTLE>沒人比刺青师更适合提供墨水了
<34-6,CASTLE>And who better to provide it than a tattoo artist?

862
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,830
<34-7,BECKETT>还有伊万·墨菲
<34-7,BECKETT>that and Evan Murphy.

863
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,480
<34-7,BECKETT>你知道我们听到消息后会马上行动
<34-7,BECKETT>You knew that we'd follow up after you told us that story,

864
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,370
<34-7,BECKETT>于是你栽赃那把枪
