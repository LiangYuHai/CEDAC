12
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:16,730
<43-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<43-1,CASTLE>Beckett?

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,800
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>兄弟没事吧
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Oh, dude.

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,120
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>兄弟你看
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Dude.

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,290
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>天啊
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Dude.

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,210
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>科学实验用的小白鼠吗
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Aw. Science project?

25
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,480
<1-2,ALEXIS>不  这是只宠物鼠
<1-2,ALEXIS>No, it's a pet.

26
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,950
<1-2,ALEXIS>打个招呼吧  老爸  他是西奥多
<1-2,ALEXIS>Say hello to Theodore, dad.

27
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,630
<1-2,ALEXIS>我帮阿什利看着的
<1-2,ALEXIS>I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.

28
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,800
<1-3,CASTLE>你好哇  西奥多
<1-3,CASTLE>Hello, theodore.

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,550
<1-3,CASTLE>-您在里面跑的怎么样  -知道吗
<1-3,CASTLE>- How goes the rat race? - Did you know

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,840
<1-4,ALEXIS>一只老鼠的寿命平均只有两到三年
<1-4,ALEXIS>the average life span of a rat is two to three years?

31
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,820
<1-4,ALEXIS>但阿什利都养了它五年了
<1-4,ALEXIS>Ashley's had theodore for five.

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,020
<1-4,ALEXIS>而且这是他第一次把他交给别人照顾
<1-4,ALEXIS>And this is the first time he's left him with anyone.

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,190
<1-5,CASTLE>这么放心把心爱的宠物交给你
<1-5,CASTLE>Trusting you with a treasured pet...

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,010
<1-5,CASTLE>感情又加深了嘛
<1-5,CASTLE>That's a big step in a relationship.

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,710
<1-6,ALEXIS>是啊  我也这么觉得
<1-6,ALEXIS>Yeah, I guess it kind of is.

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,230
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>我得说  这小瘟疫传播者
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>I must say, the little plague pusher

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,230
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>好像不怎么爱锻炼啊
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>is not very diligent about his exercise.

38
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,300
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>不知道为什么
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>I don't know.

39
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>可能是因为它贼溜溜的眼睛吧
<1-7,MARTHA RODGERS>I-I think it's just those beady little eyes.

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,480
<1-8,CASTLE>老妈  它是只老鼠
<1-8,CASTLE>It's a rat, mother.

41
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,730
<1-8,CASTLE>老鼠眼睛都这么贼溜溜的
<1-8,CASTLE>They all have beady eyes.

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,500
<1-8,CASTLE>贼眉鼠眼就这么来的
<1-8,CASTLE>That's where the phrase comes from.

43
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,120
<1-9,ALEXIS>爸  那是给西奥多吃的
<1-9,ALEXIS>Dad, those are for Theodore.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,010
<1-9,ALEXIS>它有一套很详细的餐谱
<1-9,ALEXIS>He has a very specific diet

45
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,550
<1-9,ALEXIS>我得按照餐谱喂它
<1-9,ALEXIS>I'm supposed to follow.

46
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,160
<1-10,CASTLE>除非他是本
<1-10,CASTLE>Well, unless he's Ben,

48
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,280
<1-10,CASTLE>我想他不会有什么异议的
<1-10,CASTLE>I'm sure he won't hold it against me.

49
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:38,950
<1-10,CASTLE>有事找我的话
<1-10,CASTLE>If anyone needs me,

50
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,480
<1-10,CASTLE>我去公园了  那有一宗命案
<1-10,CASTLE>I'll be in the park with a dead body.

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,880
<1-11,ALEXIS>本是谁
<1-11,ALEXIS>Who's Ben?

52
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,690
<1-12,MARTHA>一个电影里面的杀人鼠
<1-12,MARTHA>Killer rat movie.

53
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,400
<1-12,MARTHA>我们那个年代的
<1-12,MARTHA>Before your time.

54
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,560
<2-1,CASTLE>知道吗  我可以理解把雪貂做宠物养
<2-1,CASTLE>You know, I understand ferrets as a pet--

55
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,390
<2-1,CASTLE>养蛇  养蜘蛛  甚至养光溜溜的鼹鼠
<2-1,CASTLE>snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.

56
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,900
<2-1,CASTLE>但是养老鼠
<2-1,CASTLE>But a rat?

57
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,400
<2-2,BECKETT>城里的孩子没准还把蟑螂当宠物养呢
<2-2,BECKETT>Probably kids in this city who keep cockroaches as pets.

58
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,550
<2-3,CASTLE>很可能
<2-3,CASTLE>You're probably right.

59
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,790
<2-3,CASTLE>你养过最奇怪的宠物是什么
<2-3,CASTLE>What's the strangest pet you've ever had?

60
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,810
<2-4,BECKETT>你喽  嘿  蕾妮
<2-4,BECKETT>You. Hey, Lanie.

61
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,390
<2-5,CASTLE>怎么回事  被人撞了又碾过去了
<2-5,CASTLE>What's this, a hit-and-run?

62
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,860
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>也可以这么说
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>In a manner of speaking.

63
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,790
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>两个自行车越野赛骑手轧过尸体
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>Two BMX bikers rode over the body,

64
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,690
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>然后报的警
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>then called it in.

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,350
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>但是死亡原因是枪伤
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds--

66
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,530
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>胸部中一枪
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>One to the chest,

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,990
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>背后两枪
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>and two more in the back.

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,010
<2-7,BECKETT>胸前背后都有枪伤
<2-7,BECKETT>So he's wounded on both sides?

69
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,450
<2-8,CASTLE>可能有两个人开火  被他赶上了
<2-8,CASTLE>Maybe there were two shooters, he was caught in the cross fire?

70
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,280
<2-9,LANIE>要回到实验室检验才能知道确切原因
<2-9,LANIE>Won't know till I get him back to the lab.

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,980
<2-10,BECKETT>死者身份呢
<2-10,BECKETT>You got an I.D.?

72
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,190
<2-11,LANIE>雷纳德·莱维特  住在皇后区臭氧公园
<2-11,LANIE>Leonard Levitt, Ozone park, Queens.

73
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,890
<2-11,LANIE>钱包  现金  钥匙都在
<2-11,LANIE>Wallet, cash, keys-- everything still here.

74
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,980
<2-12,BECKETT>-也就是说这不是一场抢劫案  -说的对
<2-12,BECKETT>- Which means it wasn't theft. - No.

75
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,850
<2-13,CASTLE>这有个更邪恶的东西
<2-13,CASTLE>Something much more nefarious.

76
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,630
<2-13,CASTLE>一翎羽毛
<2-13,CASTLE>A feather.

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,950
<2-13,CASTLE>交替式纹路  色泽均匀
<2-13,CASTLE>Alternating stripes, uniform color...

78
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,550
<2-13,CASTLE>这不是普通的鸽子羽毛
<2-13,CASTLE>This is no ordinary pigeon feather.

79
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,500
<2-13,CASTLE>这  这是一只猛禽的羽毛
<2-13,CASTLE>This... This is from a bird of prey.

80
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,880
<2-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你是想说
<2-14,BECKETT>So what are you suggesting, Castle,

81
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,280
<2-14,BECKETT>一只鸟开枪打中他三次吗
<2-14,BECKETT>that a bird shot him three times?

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,790
<2-15,CASTLE>这可不是普通的鸟
<2-15,CASTLE>Not just any bird.

83
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,910
<2-15,CASTLE>这正是凶手杀人留下的特殊标志
<2-15,CASTLE>This is the calling card of a murderer

84
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,860
<2-15,CASTLE>而这个凶手  就是"猎鹰杀手"
<2-15,CASTLE>known only as... The Falcon Killer.

85
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,680
<2-16,BECKETT>也有可能是没中枪之前
<2-16,BECKETT>Or maybe before getting shot,

86
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,530
<2-16,BECKETT>他正弯腰去捡这只羽毛呢
<2-16,BECKETT>he just bent down and picked up the feather.

87
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,930
<2-17,CASTLE>看吧  所以你们当不了畅销小说家
<2-17,CASTLE>See, that's why you'll never be a best-selling novelist.

88
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,370
<2-17,CASTLE>一点情节构造感都没有
<2-17,CASTLE>No sense of drama.

89
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,520
<2-18,BECKETT>对我来说有死尸就已经够了
<2-18,BECKETT>I find that dead bodies are usually enough.

90
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,390
<2-18,BECKETT>多谢  蕾妮
<2-18,BECKETT>Thanks, Lanie.

91
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,040
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我们查了死者的相关背景  收获很少
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo. So we ran background on your vic. It's pretty thin.

92
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,170
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他是个纽约市运输部门的工人
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>He was a New York city transit employee.

93
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,380
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>在第一一六大街地铁站工作
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Worked in the subway out of the 116th street station.

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,620
<3-2,BECKETT>他在市中心上班  住在皇后区
<3-2,BECKETT>He worked uptown and he lived in queens?

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,180
<3-2,BECKETT>那他去公园做什么
<3-2,BECKETT>Then what was he doing in the park?

96
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,090
<3-2,BECKETT>这太不通情理了
<3-2,BECKETT>That's pretty out of the way.

97
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,900
<3-3,ESPOSITO>我们以为他是去找地方
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Well, we thought that he was looking to buy

98
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,590
<3-3,ESPOSITO>吸毒或者嫖娼  但是这家伙没有吸毒史
<3-3,ESPOSITO>some weed or some love, but he has no drug history,

99
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,220
<3-3,ESPOSITO>没犯过教唆罪  白的像纸一样
<3-3,ESPOSITO>no convictions of solicitations, no nothing.

100
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,040
<3-4,BECKETT>那他的家人呢
<3-4,BECKETT>And what about his family?

101
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,210
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>父母双亡  没结过婚
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>Both parents are deceased. Guy never married,

102
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,940
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>没有孩子  就好像他从来没存在过一样
<3-5,KEVIN RYAN>has no children. It's like he barely existed.

103
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,690
<3-6,CASTLE>真是完美的被害人
<3-6,CASTLE>Making him the perfect victim.

104
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,370
<3-6,CASTLE>一个城市职员  性格温和
<3-6,CASTLE>Mild-mannered city employee

105
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,000
<3-6,CASTLE>被引诱到树木丛生的地方
<3-6,CASTLE>lured into a conveniently wooded area,

106
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,010
<3-6,CASTLE>被猎鹰般的凶手
<3-6,CASTLE>struck down by a murderer

107
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,980
<3-6,CASTLE>以迅雷不及掩耳之势击毙
<3-6,CASTLE>with the speed and cunning of a bird of prey.

108
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,190
<3-7,BECKETT>别理他  你们去他的住处
<3-7,BECKETT>Don't ask. You guys go to his apartment.

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,990
<3-7,BECKETT>查查他是怎样一个人
<3-7,BECKETT>Find out who he is

110
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,090
<3-7,BECKETT>-看他去公园做什么  -好的
<3-7,BECKETT>- and what he was doing in the park.  - Right.

111
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,780
<4-1,LANIE>尸斑和体温显示死亡时间是
<4-1,LANIE>Lividity and temperature puts time of death

112
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,220
<4-1,LANIE>晚上五点到七点
<4-1,LANIE>between 5:00 and 7:00 pm.

113
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,710
<4-1,LANIE>死者手腕断裂
<4-1,LANIE>The victim also has a broken wrist.

114
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,180
<4-1,LANIE>可能是死后被越野自行车骑手碾压
<4-1,LANIE>Could be postmortem from those bmxers

115
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,900
<4-1,LANIE>玩花样动作时造成的
<4-1,LANIE>playing x games on his corpse.

116
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,640
<4-2,BECKETT>-枪伤呢  -三处伤口
<4-2,BECKETT>- What about the gunshot wounds? - All three entry wounds

117
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,770
<4-3,LANIE>都是由同一把45口径手枪造成
<4-3,LANIE>were made by the same weapon-- a .45.

118
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,370
<4-3,LANIE>凶手只有一个
<4-3,LANIE>There was only one shooter.

119
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,460
<4-4,BECKETT>同一个人打中他胸口
<4-4,BECKETT>So the same person shot him in the front,

120
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,830
<4-4,BECKETT>又在他背后放了两枪
<4-4,BECKETT>and then shot him in the back?

121
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,330
<4-5,LANIE>我也想不通
<4-5,LANIE>Didn't make any sense to me either,

122
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,250
<4-5,LANIE>所以我做了几项检测
<4-5,LANIE>so I decided to take some measurements.

123
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,370
<4-5,LANIE>结果证明  三处伤口深度各不相同
<4-5,LANIE>Turns out, the wounds are of different depths.

124
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,220
<4-6,LANIE>胸部枪伤十分浅
<4-6,LANIE>The one on his chest is very shallow,

125
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,170
<4-6,LANIE>证明凶手是在一定距离以外开枪的
<4-6,LANIE>indicating the shot came from a distance.

126
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,960
<4-7,CASTLE>-多远  -150英尺左右[约45米]
<4-7,CASTLE>- How far? - About 150 feet.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,390
<4-9,CASTLE>凶手枪法很准嘛
<4-9,CASTLE>That's quite an accurate shot with a handgun.

128
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,350
<4-10,LANIE>我判断凶手有射击经验
<4-10,LANIE>Yeah, I'd say your killer had some shooting experience.

129
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,520
<4-10,LANIE>但是背后的两处伤口  射程很近
<4-10,LANIE>But the next two shots in the back were close range,

130
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,740
<4-10,LANIE>大概在6英尺以内[1米8左右]
<4-10,LANIE>inside 6 feet, maybe.

131
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,260
<4-11,BECKETT>也就是说  死者在远距离胸部中枪后
<4-11,BECKETT>So he got shot in the chest at long range,

132
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,960
<4-11,BECKETT>-转身想逃跑  -但是他受伤了
<4-11,BECKETT>- turned around to run... - But he's wounded.

133
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,370
<4-12,CASTLE>凶手穷追不舍要干掉他
<4-12,CASTLE>The killer goes after him to finish what he started

134
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,270
<4-12,CASTLE>在背后又开了两枪
<4-12,CASTLE>with a double tap to the back.

135
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,710
<4-13,BECKETT>他不只是被枪杀了
<4-13,BECKETT>He wasn't just shot.

136
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,550
<4-13,BECKETT>他是被穷追猛打击杀的
<4-13,BECKETT>He was hunted down and killed.

137
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,350
<4-14,CASTLE>但是为什么呢
<4-14,CASTLE>But why?

138
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:11,650
<4-14,CASTLE>哇
<4-14,CASTLE>Whoa.

139
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,140
<5-1,RYAN>这家伙在干什么
<5-1,RYAN>What was this guy up to?

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,960
<5-2,ESPOSITO>不知道
<5-2,ESPOSITO>No idea.

141
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,240
<5-4,RYAN>-那是什么  -好像是什么计数的东西
<5-4,RYAN>- What about that? - Looks like some sort of counter.

142
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,720
<5-5,ESPOSITO>你觉得他在计算什么
<5-5,ESPOSITO>What do you think he was counting?

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,390
<5-6,RYAN>不是什么好事
<5-6,RYAN>Nothing good.

144
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,780
<5-6,RYAN>夜视镜  射弹观测镜
<5-6,RYAN>Night vision, spotting scope,

<5-6,RYAN>parabolic microphone--

146
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,100
<5-6,RYAN>都是高级设备啊
<5-6,RYAN>Top quality, too.

147
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,480
<5-6,RYAN>一个地铁职员用这些做什么
<5-6,RYAN>What's a subway worker doing with all this?

148
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,060
<5-6,RYAN>搞不懂
<5-6,RYAN>I don't know.

149
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,940
<5-7,ESPOSITO>不管他在做什么
<5-7,ESPOSITO>But whatever he was into,

150
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,880
<5-7,ESPOSITO>都和这个公园脱不了干系  看
<5-7,ESPOSITO>it had something to do with the park. Look.

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,440
<5-7,ESPOSITO>这正是发现他尸体的地方
<5-7,ESPOSITO>This is right where his body was found.

152
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,690
<5-8,RYAN>5:26  和死亡时间差不多
<5-8,RYAN>5:26--that's around our time of death.

153
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,430
<5-9,ESPOSITO>看起来他在追踪缩写为BHS的
<5-9,ESPOSITO>Looks like he was tracking something or someone

154
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,500
<5-9,ESPOSITO>什么东西或者什么人
<5-9,ESPOSITO>with the initials b.H.S.

155
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,180
<5-10,RYAN>而且看起来他是被那人找上了
<5-10,RYAN>And it looks like that someone found him.

156
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,940
<6-1,CASTLE>监视工具  秘密接头
<6-1,CASTLE>Surveillance equipment, clandestine meetings,

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
<6-1,CASTLE>职业杀手
<6-1,CASTLE>a professional hit--

158
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,630
<6-1,CASTLE>结合地铁元素  像是在看电影
<6-1,CASTLE>mix in the subway, and we're looking at

159
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
<6-1,CASTLE>《骑劫地下铁》[惊悚犯罪电影]
<6-1,CASTLE>"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3,"

160
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,570
<6-1,CASTLE>或者更好一点的
<6-1,CASTLE>or better yet,

161
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,590
<6-1,CASTLE>《金钱列车》[惊悚犯罪电影]
<6-1,CASTLE>"Money train."

162
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,500
<6-1,CASTLE>这里每一个人都有可能是帮凶
<6-1,CASTLE>Any one of these people could be a secret accomplice.

163
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,530
<6-1,CASTLE>这正是地铁有爱的地方
<6-1,CASTLE>That's what I love about the subway.

164
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,390
<6-1,CASTLE>在这里  每一个人都有一个故事
<6-1,CASTLE>Down here, everyone's got a story.

165
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,220
<6-2,BECKETT>看  这就是我们两个不同的地方
<6-2,BECKETT>See, that's the difference between you and me, Castle.

166
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,810
<6-2,BECKETT>你把地铁看成是构造你小说对白的地方
<6-2,BECKETT>You see the subway as a place to pick up dialogue for your novels.

167
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,790
<6-3,CASTLE>有时也是"投资银行家"
<6-3,CASTLE>Or the occasional investment banker

168
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,860
<6-3,CASTLE>前往健身房的必经之路[卡塞尔泡妞手段]
<6-3,CASTLE>on her way to the gym.

169
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,590
<6-4,BECKETT>而我  把这里看作是
<6-4,BECKETT>I, on the other hand, see it as a way of getting

170
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,130
<6-4,BECKETT>从A点到B点交通手段
<6-4,BECKETT>from point "A" to point "B."

171
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,210
<7-1,MARIO>看来是灯泡雷恩死了啊
<7-1,MARIO>So lightbulb Len's dead, huh?

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,620
<7-2,CASTLE>-灯泡雷恩  -对  他负责更换整个纽约的
<7-2,CASTLE>- Lightbulb Len?  - Yeah, it was his job to change the lightbulbs

173
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,590
<7-3,MARIO>地铁和隧道的灯泡
<7-3,MARIO>in the stations and tunnels all over New York.

174
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,110
<7-3,MARIO>我就知道出事了
<7-3,MARIO>I figured something was wrong.

175
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,230
<7-3,MARIO>22年了  这是他第一次上班缺勤
<7-3,MARIO>It's the first time he's missed work in 22 years.

176
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,570
<7-4,BECKETT>里维拉先生  雷恩被人发现在公园中枪而死
<7-4,BECKETT>Mr. Rivera, Len was found shot to death in the park.

177
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,960
<7-4,BECKETT>知道他为什么会去公园吗
<7-4,BECKETT>Any idea what he was doing there?

178
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,340
<7-5,MARIO>他以换灯泡为生
<7-5,MARIO>The guy changed lightbulbs for a living.

179
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,980
<7-5,MARIO>你也知道  那样的工作  是不合群的
<7-5,MARIO>You know, a job like that, it's not for the social.

180
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,960
<7-5,MARIO>我当他的上司都12年了
<7-5,MARIO>I mean, in the 12 years I was his supervisor,

181
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,580
<7-5,MARIO>我想我们甚至没有私下聊过天
<7-5,MARIO>I don't think we ever had one personal conversation.

182
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,390
<7-6,MARIO>-不过有个人你们该去问问  -谁
<7-6,MARIO>- But you know who you should talk to?  - Who?

183
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,670
<8-1,BECKETT>桑瑟先生
<8-1,BECKETT>Mr. Sansone?

184
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,880
<8-1,BECKETT>亚瑟
<8-1,BECKETT>Arthur!

185
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,880
<8-1,BECKETT>抱歉   只是
<8-1,BECKETT>I'm sorry. It's just...

186
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,790
<8-1,BECKETT>怎么会有人要枪杀他呢
<8-1,BECKETT>Why would anybody want to shoot him?

187
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,280
<9-1,ARTHUR>我们正希望您能帮我们解答这个问题呢
<9-1,ARTHUR>Well, we were hoping that you could tell us that.

188
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,680
<9-2,BECKETT>他是这座城市的无名英雄
<9-2,BECKETT>Well, the guy was one of the unsung heroes of this city.

189
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,240
<9-3,ARTHUR>他挽救了无数条生命
<9-3,ARTHUR>He saved a lot of lives.

190
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,220
<9-4,CASTLE>抱歉  我...我还以为他是换灯泡的
<9-4,CASTLE>I'm sorry. I thought-- I thought he changed lightbulbs.

191
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,360
<9-5,ARTHUR>坏事总是发生在黑暗里的  卡塞尔先生
<9-5,ARTHUR>Bad things happen in darkness, Mr. Castle,

192
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,500
<9-5,ARTHUR>比如昏暗的隧道
<9-5,ARTHUR>Dimly lit tunnels,

193
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,490
<9-5,ARTHUR>黑暗的楼梯井
<9-5,ARTHUR>Darkened stairwells.

194
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,890
<9-5,ARTHUR>如果雷恩在下班前听到有灯泡爆炸了
<9-5,ARTHUR>If Len heard about a blown bulb before shift end,

195
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,780
<9-5,ARTHUR>他会主动留下  利用自己的时间把它修好
<9-5,ARTHUR>He would stay late, on his own time, to fix it.

196
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,920
<9-5,ARTHUR>当然  还有他对阿布·里普施茨的悲剧
<9-5,ARTHUR>And of course, there was his response

197
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,630
<9-5,ARTHUR>所做出的回应
<9-5,ARTHUR>to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.

198
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,900
<9-5,ARTHUR>1989年
<9-5,ARTHUR>1989...

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,700
<9-5,ARTHUR>一个灯泡更换工
<9-5,ARTHUR>An electrocution of a bulb changer

200
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,920
<9-5,ARTHUR>被电死在布莱顿海滩站
<9-5,ARTHUR>at the Brighton Beach station.

201
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,650
<9-6,ARTHUR>这是个断路器开关
<9-6,ARTHUR>This is a circuit interrupter switch.

202
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,200
<9-6,ARTHUR>能切断隧道里的所有电源
<9-6,ARTHUR>Shuts down all of the power inside a tunnel

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,130
<9-6,ARTHUR>这样维修电路就很安全了
<9-6,ARTHUR>So that electrical maintenance could be performed safely.

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,870
<9-6,ARTHUR>这个东西
<9-6,ARTHUR>Down here...

205
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,270
<10-1,ESPOSITO>被称为雷恩之盒
<10-1,ESPOSITO>It's called the Lenny box...

206
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,290
<9-6,ARTHUR>因为就是雷恩·莱维特这样的梦想家设计了它
<9-6,ARTHUR>Because it took a visionary like Len Levitt to design it

207
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,140
<9-6,ARTHUR>并迫使高速运输管理局
<9-6,ARTHUR>and force the transit authority

208
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,880
<9-6,ARTHUR>在这个城市的每个站点都安装了一个
<9-6,ARTHUR>to install one in every station in this city.

209
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,880
<9-7,BECKETT>高科技的工具呢
<9-7,BECKETT>What about high-tech gear?

210
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,050
<9-7,BECKETT>雷恩在工作中是否使用过夜视镜
<9-7,BECKETT>Did Lenny ever use any night vision

211
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,420
<9-7,BECKETT>或者麦克风之类的东西
<9-7,BECKETT>or microphones for his work?

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,790
<9-8,ARTHUR>没有  怎么了
<9-8,ARTHUR>No. Why?

213
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,540
<9-9,CASTLE>BHS这几个字母  能让你想到什么吗
<9-9,CASTLE>How about the initials B.H.S.? Does that mean anything to you?

214
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,130
<9-9,CASTLE>可能是雷恩密切关注的某个人或某种东西
<9-9,CASTLE>Maybe someone or something that Len was keeping tabs on.

215
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,840
<9-10,ARTHUR>雷恩·莱维特唯一关注的
<9-10,ARTHUR>The only thing Len Levitt ever kept tabs on

216
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,700
<9-10,ARTHUR>就是他换过的每一个灯泡
<9-10,ARTHUR>was every single bulb he ever changed.

217
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,280
<9-11,BECKETT>据你所知  他是否有任何敌人
<9-11,BECKETT>Did he have any enemies that you know of?

218
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,100
<9-12,ARTHUR>想办大事  不结下几个仇人是不可能的
<9-12,ARTHUR>You don't make waves without making a few enemies.

219
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,210
<9-12,ARTHUR>由于雷恩的努力
<9-12,ARTHUR>Because of Len,

220
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,110
<9-12,ARTHUR>现在整个系统正在更新装置
<9-12,ARTHUR>we're in the middle  of a systemwide changeover

221
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,600
<9-12,ARTHUR>要将白炽灯换成节能灯
<9-12,ARTHUR>from incandescent to compact fluorescents.

222
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,140
<9-12,ARTHUR>新技术逐渐入主这里
<9-12,ARTHUR>New technology comes in,

223
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,270
<9-12,ARTHUR>这城市最终会像仓库一样堆满老式灯泡
<9-12,ARTHUR>the city ends up with a warehouse full of old bulbs.

224
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,440
<9-12,ARTHUR>这就让一些生产老式灯泡的人
<9-12,ARTHUR>That makes some guy in a suit at the old bulb factory

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,350
<9-12,ARTHUR>非常不爽
<9-12,ARTHUR>very unhappy.

226
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:49,990
<9-12,ARTHUR>在我看来
<9-12,ARTHUR>You ask me,

227
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,690
<9-12,ARTHUR>是某个公司密谋除掉雷恩的
<9-12,ARTHUR>corporations conspired to take Lenny out.

228
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,440
<10-1,ESPOSITO>雷恩之盒
<10-1,ESPOSITO>"'Lenny box.'"

229
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,880
<10-1,ESPOSITO>这家伙还是个发明家啊
<10-1,ESPOSITO>So the guy's an inventor?

230
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,770
<10-2,CASTLE>很明显  他是个多才多艺的地下工作者
<10-2,CASTLE>Apparently he was an underground renaissance man.

231
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,920
<10-3,ESPOSITO>这就解释了那些电子设备
<10-3,ESPOSITO>Guess that explains all the electronics.

232
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,290
<10-4,CASTLE>还有他公寓里记下的数字
<10-4,CASTLE>And the counter in his apartment--

233
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,890
<10-4,CASTLE>是他更换过的所有灯泡的数量
<10-4,CASTLE>All the lightbulbs he changed.

234
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,410
<10-5,ESPOSITO>真的吗  这家伙换过一百多万只灯泡
<10-5,ESPOSITO>Seriously, this guy changed over a million lightbulbs?

235
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,540
<10-6,CASTLE>他是个无名英雄   明白吗
<10-6,CASTLE>The man was an unsung hero, all right?

236
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,900
<10-6,CASTLE>-被一些大灯泡干掉了  -大灯泡
<10-6,CASTLE>- Cut down by the forces of big bulb.  - Big bulb?

00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,570
<10-7,ESPOSITO>灯丝工业中心
<10-7,ESPOSITO>The filament-industrial complex.

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,070
<10-8,CASTLE>如果雷恩那个朋友真认为他是被灯泡企业
<10-8,CASTLE>Lenny's buddy is delusional if he actually thinks

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,410
<10-9,BECKETT>密谋干掉的  那他一定有妄想症
<10-9,BECKETT>that Lenny was killed by a lightbulb conspiracy.

240
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,980
<10-10,RYAN>还不能排除那位地下工作者的说法
<10-10,RYAN>Well, I wouldn't dismiss our subterranean friend just yet.

241
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,120
<10-10,RYAN>我查看了雷恩的通话记录
<10-10,RYAN>I was running through len's phone records,

242
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,690
<10-10,RYAN>发现了这通电话
<10-10,RYAN>and one jumped out.

243
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,540
<10-11,BECKETT>他打给纽约市员工举报热线的
<10-11,BECKETT>The outgoing call to the New York city employee tip line?

244
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,270
<10-12,RYAN>如果你要举报同事  就可以打这个热线
<10-12,RYAN>It's where you call to rat out your coworkers.

245
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,130
<10-13,CASTLE>"老鼠"非得用成贬义词么
<10-13,CASTLE>Must "Rat" always be used in the pejorative?

247
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,710
<10-13,CASTLE>在中国的生肖里  老鼠是
<10-13,CASTLE>In the chinese zodiac, the rat is ac--

248
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,710
<10-14,BECKETT>他举报了什么
<10-14,BECKETT>What was the tip?

249
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,760
<10-15,RYAN>他们换下来的那些白炽灯泡
<10-15,RYAN>Well, all those incandescent bulbs they were replacing?

250
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,440
<10-15,RYAN>莱维特声称自己有证据证明
<10-15,RYAN>Levitt claims that he had evidence his supervisor was

251
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,580
<10-15,RYAN>他的上司将它们偷去  并转手在黑市上变卖
<10-15,RYAN>stealing them and then reselling them on the black market.

252
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,820
<10-16,BECKETT>你是说马里奥·里维拉吗
<10-16,BECKETT>You mean Mario Rivera?

253
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,420
<10-17,RYAN>就是他  如果指控成立
<10-17,RYAN>The same. The charges pan out,

254
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,120
<10-17,RYAN>这人的工作和退休金就都没了
<10-17,RYAN>the guy could lose his job and his pension.

255
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,970
<10-17,RYAN>还有  在他去高速运输管理局之前
<10-17,RYAN>Oh, and get this, before he was in the transit authority,

<11-1,BECKETT>昨晚五点至七点你人在何处
<11-1,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 5:00 and 7:00 pm?

263
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,250
<11-3,BECKETT>-在上班  -我们查过  你4:34就打卡下班了
<11-3,BECKETT>- Working.  - We checked. You clocked out at 4:34.

264
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,370
<11-4,CASTLE>你去了59街的B区或D区
<11-4,CASTLE>You, uh, hop the B or the D down to 59th street.

265
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,990
<11-4,CASTLE>搭捷运的话只要  多久  十分钟吗
<11-4,CASTLE>The express only takes, what, ten minutes?

266
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,700
<11-4,CASTLE>有足够的时间去公园杀死雷恩
<11-4,CASTLE>Plenty of time to get to the park, kill Len.

267
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,640
<11-5,MARIO>我为什么要杀他
<11-5,MARIO>Why would I kill len?

268
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,480
<11-6,CASTLE>因为当他发现了哥斯达黎加的事后
<11-6,CASTLE>Because he filed a report against you

269
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,980
<11-6,CASTLE>曾向高运管理局提交了一份指控你的报告
<11-6,CASTLE>with the transit authority when he found out about Costa Rica.

270
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,780
<11-7,MARIO>你们在胡说八道些什么
<11-7,MARIO>What the hell are you guys talking about?

271
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,880
<11-8,BECKETT>这些是你发出去的电子邮件
<11-8,BECKETT>These are e-mails that were sent from you

272
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,370
<11-8,BECKETT>发给你在哥斯达黎加的联系人的
<11-8,BECKETT>to your contact in Costa Rica.

273
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,800
<11-9,MARIO>这些是我的私人邮件
<11-9,MARIO>These are my private e-mails.

274
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,600
<11-10,BECKETT>可你是用工作间的电脑发送的
<11-10,BECKETT>Sent from a workplace computer,

275
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,530
<11-10,BECKETT>所以我们有权查看
<11-10,BECKETT>which means we can look.

276
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,040
<11-11,MARIO>我只是在考虑去那里度假
<11-11,MARIO>So I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.

277
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,380
<11-12,CASTLE>是啊  喝几杯啤酒
<11-12,CASTLE>Yeah, drink a few cervezas,

278
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,840
<11-12,CASTLE>没准儿还在海滩跳跳伞
<11-12,CASTLE>maybe go parasailing on the beach,

279
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,980
<11-12,CASTLE>顺便卖几个灯泡给当地人
<11-12,CASTLE>sell some lightbulbs to some locals.

280
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,130
<11-13,BECKETT>这个城市就像个大仓库
<11-13,BECKETT>The city has a warehouse

281
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,980
<11-13,BECKETT>堆满了老式的白炽灯泡
<11-13,BECKETT>full of old, incandescent lightbulbs

282
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,160
<11-13,BECKETT>你认为反正没人注意
<11-13,BECKETT>that you figured no one would miss,

283
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,990
<11-13,BECKETT>于是就以20美分一只的价格卖给了
<11-13,BECKETT>so you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica

284
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,990
<11-13,BECKETT>你在哥斯达黎加的批发商  加起来就是十万
<11-13,BECKETT>for 20 cents a pop. That's 100 grand.

285
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,720
<11-14,CASTLE>可惜有人留意到了
<11-14,CASTLE>Only someone did miss them.

286
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,520
<11-14,CASTLE>一个叫做灯泡啥啥的人
<11-14,CASTLE>Someone with the word "Lightbulb" in his name.

287
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,800
<11-14,CASTLE>当你发现雷恩知道了你的意图
<11-14,CASTLE>When you found out Len was on to you,

288
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,500
<11-14,CASTLE>你意识到自己会同时失去工作和退休金
<11-14,CASTLE>you realized you could lose your job and your pension.

289
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,540
<11-14,CASTLE>所以你不能让他带着掌握的证据
<11-14,CASTLE>You couldn't afford to let him go to the transit authority

290
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,510
<11-14,CASTLE>去高运管理局举报你
<11-14,CASTLE>with what he knew.

291
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,710
<11-15,MARIO>我没杀人
<11-15,MARIO>I didn't kill nobody.

292
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,970
<11-16,BECKETT>那就解释一下
<11-16,BECKETT>Well, then why don't you just come clean

293
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,870
<11-16,BECKETT>昨晚五点至七点你做了些什么吧
<11-16,BECKETT>with what you did last night between 5:00 and 7:00?

294
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,510
<11-16,BECKETT>马里奥  杀人犯
<11-16,BECKETT>The thing about murderers, Mario,

295
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,950
<11-16,BECKETT>一般都没有可靠的不在场证明
<11-16,BECKETT>Is they tend to not have solid alibis.

296
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,120
<11-17,CASTLE>通常是因为案发时他们正在杀人
<11-17,CASTLE>Generally because they're murdering somebody.

297
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,500
<11-17,CASTLE>听着
<11-17,CASTLE>Look...

298
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,860
<11-18,MARIO>那些老式灯泡  最终会被销毁
<11-18,MARIO>those old lightbulbs were just gonna get destroyed

299
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,290
<11-18,MARIO>然后扔到垃圾场去
<11-18,MARIO>and end up in a landfill.

300
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,970
<11-18,MARIO>我只是帮这个城市解决难题
<11-18,MARIO>I was doing the city a favor.

301
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,650
<11-18,MARIO>没错  我是赚了点外快  伤着谁了啊
<11-18,MARIO>So I make a little extra. So who gets hurt?

302
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,000
<11-19,CASTLE>我想说  伤着雷恩了
<11-19,CASTLE>Uh... I'm gonna go with Len.

303
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,820
<11-20,BECKETT>最后一次机会  马里奥
<11-20,BECKETT>Last chance, Mario.

304
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,810
<11-21,MARIO>下班后  我去了大广场街
<11-21,MARIO>After work, went up to the Grand Concourse

305
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,510
<11-21,MARIO>去把灯泡打包以便发运
<11-21,MARIO>to pack up a shipment of lightbulbs.

306
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,970
<11-21,MARIO>昨晚已经发往哥斯达黎加了
<11-21,MARIO>They went out to Costa Rica last night.

307
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,060
<11-21,MARIO>你们可以去查
<11-21,MARIO>You can check.

308
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,480
<11-21,MARIO>我在那里
<11-21,MARIO>I was there.

309
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,280
<11-21,MARIO>谢谢
<11-21,MARIO>Thanks.

310
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,050
<12-1,ESPOSITO>他说的是实话  雷恩打的那通举报电话
<12-1,ESPOSITO>He's telling the truth. Len's call to the tip line?

311
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,640
<12-2,BECKETT>原来运输局那边
<12-2,BECKETT>Turns out that the transit cops

312
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,260
<12-1,ESPOSITO>上周派人去监视他了
<12-1,ESPOSITO>had him under surveillance all last week.

313
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,450
<12-1,ESPOSITO>负责跟踪他的人证明他昨晚
<12-1,ESPOSITO>His tail has him in the Bronx

314
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,620
<12-1,ESPOSITO>在布朗克斯区  跟他说的一样
<12-1,ESPOSITO>last night just like he said.

315
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,270
<12-2,BECKETT>打电话告诉运输局的
<12-2,BECKETT>Call the transit cops and tell them

316
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,880
<12-2,BECKETT>-我们刚帮他们结案了  -好
<12-2,BECKETT>- that we just closed their case for them. - Right.

317
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,400
<12-4,CASTLE>如果不是灯泡害死了雷恩  那是什么呢
<12-4,CASTLE>So if lightbulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?

318
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,470
<12-5,BECKETT>他被杀的时间跟他写下的时间恰好一致
<12-5,BECKETT>You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed

319
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,420
<12-5,BECKETT>这不可能是巧合
<12-5,BECKETT>right there at about the same time that he has written down.

320
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,970
<12-6,CASTLE>还有BHS又代表了什么呢  布朗克斯高中
<12-6,CASTLE>And what does "B.H.S." Stand for? Bronx high school?

321
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,640
<12-9,CASTLE>大型立体声音箱
<12-9,CASTLE>Big honkin' stereo?

322
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,910
<12-10,CASTLE>-有鞋的男孩  -试试拜伦· H· 辛格
<12-10,CASTLE>- Boys have shoes?  - Try Byron H. Singer.

323
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,400
<12-11,RYAN>我在他公寓里找到的抛物面传声器上
<12-11,RYAN>I found a small vendor decal on the side

324
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,540
<12-11,RYAN>找到了一小张卖家的贴纸
<12-11,RYAN>of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment,

325
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,450
<12-11,RYAN>于是我打电话去问对方是否知道
<12-11,RYAN>So I called the vendor to find out if he knew

326
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,960
<12-11,RYAN>雷恩为什么要买那仪器
<12-11,RYAN>why Len bought the equipment.

327
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,590
<12-11,RYAN>结果发现  雷恩根本没买过
<12-11,RYAN>Turns out, Len didn't buy it at all.

328
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,700
<12-11,RYAN>是两个月前  一个保险公司理赔员买下的
<12-11,RYAN>It was purchased two months ago by an insurance actuary

329
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,910
<12-11,RYAN>-那人名叫拜伦·H·辛格  -BHS
<12-11,RYAN>- named Byron H. Singer.  - B.H.S.!

330
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,760
<12-12,BECKETT>不好意思
<12-12,BECKETT>Sorry.

331
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,690
<13-1,BECKETT>辛格先生  谢谢赶你过来
<13-1,BECKETT>Mr. Singer, thank you for coming down.

332
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,010
<13-2,BYRON>他们说有重要事情
<13-2,BYRON>They said it was important.

333
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,190
<13-3,BECKETT>你认识一个叫雷恩·莱维特的人吗
<13-3,BECKETT>Do you know a man named Len Levitt?

334
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,530
<13-4,BYRON>-那混蛋跟你们说什么了  -他什么也没说
<13-4,BYRON>- What did that bastard tell you?  - He didn't tell us anything.

335
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,860
<13-5,BECKETT>那就好  因为他满口胡言
<13-5,BECKETT>Good, because he's a liar.

336
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,340
<13-6,BYRON>他以为他比我更了解
<13-6,BYRON>He thought he knew better than me.

337
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,400
<13-6,BYRON>-他一副自大狂的样子  -辛格先生
<13-6,BYRON>- He thought he knew better than everybody. - Mr. Singer--

338
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,520
<13-8,BYRON>我不在乎他相信与否
<13-8,BYRON>I don't care if he didn't believe me.

339
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,440
<13-8,BYRON>我不在乎这会很伤他自尊
<13-8,BYRON>I don't care how much it hurt him.

340
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,160
<13-8,BYRON>我知道自己看到了什么
<13-8,BYRON>I know what I saw.

341
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,330
<13-9,BECKETT>你看到了什么
<13-9,BECKETT>And what did you see?

342
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,360
<13-10,BYRON>它们两个  一起
<13-10,BYRON>The two of them, together,

343
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,880
<13-10,BYRON>在公园里  像一对情侣鹦鹉
<13-10,BYRON>in the park, like a pair of lovebirds.

344
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,720
<13-10,BYRON>但他控告我捏造了这事
<13-10,BYRON>But he accused me of making the whole thing up.

345
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,080
<13-10,BYRON>我说  我为什么要捏造呢
<13-10,BYRON>I mean, why would I make something like that up?

346
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,970
<13-10,BYRON>任何人都不会
<13-10,BYRON>Why would anybody?

347
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,540
<13-11,BECKETT>辛格先生  你究竟在公园里看见了什么
<13-11,BECKETT>Mr. Singer, what exactly did you see in the park?

348
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,690
<13-12,BRYON>我看得很仔细
<13-12,BRYON>I saw enough.

349
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,990
<13-12,BRYON>相信我  看到它们时  我都惊呆了
<13-12,BRYON>And believe me, I was pretty shocked to see them together.

350
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,120
<13-12,BRYON>我必须抢先告诉雷恩
<13-12,BRYON>I knew I had to tell Len before somebody else did.

351
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,140
<13-13,CASTLE>当你告诉雷恩时  他肯定很生气
<13-13,CASTLE>Len must have been very angry when you told him.

352
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,880
<13-14,BRYON>既生气又嫉妒  但我跟踪它们
<13-14,BRYON>Very angry and jealous, but I had followed them

353
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,410
<13-14,BRYON>并且发现它们秘密巢穴
<13-14,BRYON>and found their secret spot.

354
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,070
<13-14,BRYON>然后我告诉他在何时何地找到它们
<13-14,BRYON>And I told him where and when to find them.

355
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,910
<13-14,BRYON>我还借给他一些设备
<13-14,BRYON>I even lent him some of my equipment

356
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,510
<13-14,BRYON>这样他可以自己监视它们
<13-14,BRYON>so he could spy on them himself.

357
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,850
<13-15,CASTLE>那么雷恩去到公园  他亲眼所见
<13-15,CASTLE>So Len goes to the park, and he sees for himself.

358
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,970
<13-16,BECKETT>接着对着他们醋意大发
<13-16,BECKETT>And then he confronts them in a jealous rage,

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,060
<13-16,BECKETT>然后他们杀了他
<13-16,BECKETT>and they kill him.

360
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,970
<13-17,BYRON>他们干了什么
<13-17,BYRON>They do what now?

361
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,100
<13-17,BYRON>他们杀了他
<13-17,BYRON>They killed him.

362
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,010
<13-18,CASTLE>红杏出墙的女友和她的情人
<13-18,CASTLE>The cheating grilfriend and her lover.

363
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,580
<13-19,BYRON>你们在说什么
<13-19,BYRON>What are you talking about?

364
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,820
<13-19,BYRON>你在说什么
<13-19,BYRON>What are you talking about?

365
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,910
<13-21,BECKETT>你那天晚上在公园里看见了谁
<13-21,BECKETT>Uh... Who did you see in the park that night?

366
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,230
<13-22,BYRON>红尾鹰
<13-22,BYRON>The red-tailed hawks.

367
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,660
<13-23,BYRON>40年来公园里都没有出现过一对
<13-23,BYRON>There haven't been a nesting pair in the park for 40 years.

368
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,810
<13-24,BECKETT>你是在说鸟
<13-24,BECKETT>You mean, this is about birds?

369
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,370
<13-24,BECKETT>不只是鸟  而是红尾鹰
<13-24,BECKETT>Not just birds. The red-tailed hawks.

370
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,400
<13-25,BYRON>雷恩监督中心公园船库的日志
<13-25,BYRON>Len oversees the log in the central park boathouse,

371
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,520
<13-25,BYRON>所有的观测都被正式记录下来
<13-25,BYRON>where all the sightings are officially recorded.

372
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,480
<13-25,BYRON>但他拒绝认可我的观测
<13-25,BYRON>But he refused to acknowledge my sighting.

373
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,840
<13-25,BYRON>所以我告诉他  如果他不相信
<13-25,BYRON>So I told him, if he didn't believe me,

374
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,000
<13-25,BYRON>他可以自己去公园亲眼看看
<13-25,BYRON>he should go out to the park and see for himself.

375
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,090
<13-25,BYRON>他们黄昏时分筑巢
<13-25,BYRON>They nest at dusk.

376
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,380
<13-26,BECKETT>辛格先生  你昨晚5点至7点
<13-26,BECKETT>Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday

377
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,020
<13-26,BECKETT>是否在公园里
<13-26,BECKETT>between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.?

378
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,200
<13-27,BYRON>通常都在  但昨天我在办公室里工作
<13-27,BYRON>Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.

379
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,650
<13-28,BECKETT>你的同事可以证实吗
<13-28,BECKETT>And can any of your colleagues verify that?

380
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,560
<13-29,BYRON>我确信可以  但关于红尾鹰
<13-29,BYRON>I'm sure they can, but about the hawks--

381
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,170
<13-29,BYRON>我希望这正式记录下来
<13-29,BYRON>and I want this on the official record--

382
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,440
<13-29,BYRON>我绝不会夸大或捏造鸟类观测
<13-29,BYRON>I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.

383
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,590
<13-29,BYRON>真难以置信
<13-29,BYRON>It's unthinkable.

384
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,750
<13-29,BYRON>它们就在那里
<13-29,BYRON>They're there,

385
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,890
<13-30,BYRON>是我先看到的
<13-30,BYRON>and I saw them first.

386
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,770
<13-31,CASTLE>我会记在官方记录里
<13-31,CASTLE>I'm putting that in the official record.

388
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,940
<14-1,BECKETT>似乎解释了一切
<14-1,BECKETT>It looks like we've explained everything.

389
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,930
<14-2,CASTLE>是的  除了他被杀的原因
<14-2,CASTLE>Yes, except why he was killed.

390
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,390
<15-1,CASTLE>早上好  老妈

<15-3,CASTLE>So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?

395
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,410
<15-6,ALEXIS>我喂他藜麦沙拉和小麦粒时
<15-6,ALEXIS>When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,

396
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,000
<15-6,ALEXIS>肯定没有关好笼子
<15-6,ALEXIS>I must not have closed the cage door all the way,

397
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,930
<15-6,ALEXIS>现在它不见了  阿什利会恨死我的
<15-6,ALEXIS>and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.

398
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,270
<15-7,CASTLE>他不会恨你的  他会理解的
<15-7,CASTLE>Oh, he's not gonna hate you. He'll understand.

<15-8,ALEXIS>不  他不会  他信任我

400
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,120
<15-8,ALEXIS>而我让他失望了
<15-8,ALEXIS>and I let him down.

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,170
<16-6,BECKETT>好吧  是的  我记得这故事
<16-6,BECKETT>Okay. Yes, I remember the story.

440
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,930
<16-7,CASTLE>那么最困难的侦查
<16-7,CASTLE>Then you know that the hardest form of detection

441
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,110
<16-7,CASTLE>就是寻找非现场证物
<16-7,CASTLE>is looking for the thing that isn't there.

442
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,380
<16-7,CASTLE>拜伦说雷恩要去证实红尾鹰的真假
<16-7,CASTLE>Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.

443
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,810
<16-7,CASTLE>证实就是提供证据  也就是说
<16-7,CASTLE>Verify, as in "Provide proof," which means...

444
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
<16-8,BECKETT>他应该有一个相机  但我们没找到
<16-8,BECKETT>He would've had a camera... which we didn't find.

445
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,770
<16-9,CASTLE>如果他当时在拍摄照片
<16-9,CASTLE>And if he was taking pictures...

446
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,340
<16-10,BECKETT>我们应该可以知道他干了些什么
<16-10,BECKETT>We should be able to figure out what he was up to.

447
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,900
<17-1,CASTLE>我们在这里发现尸体
<17-1,CASTLE>We found the body here,

448
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,780
<17-1,CASTLE>他被最后两枚子弹打中
<17-1,CASTLE>where he took the last two bullets...

449
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,290
<17-2,BECKETT>逃离凶手追击
<17-2,BECKETT>Running away from his killer.

450
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,000
<17-3,CASTLE>他的手腕断了
<17-3,CASTLE>He had a broken wrist.

451
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,060
<17-4,BECKETT>被越野自行车手碾过所致
<17-4,BECKETT>From the bmx guys riding over his body.

452
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,620
<17-5,CASTLE>或是从树上摔下导致的
<17-5,CASTLE>Or he fell from a tree.

453
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,840
<17-6,CASTLE>这棵树
<17-6,CASTLE>This tree.

454
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,500
<17-6,CASTLE>这个坑还很新
<17-6,CASTLE>There's a fresh divot.

455
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,580
<18-1,BECKETT>全是鸟类
<18-1,BECKETT>It's all birds.

456
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,490
<18-1,BECKETT>红尾鹰
<18-1,BECKETT>Red-tailed hawks.

457
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,980
<18-2,CASTLE>看来拜伦·辛格说的是真的
<18-2,CASTLE>Looks like Byron Singer was telling the truth after all.

458
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,060
<18-3,BECKETT>没错  提醒我通知"鸟类警察"
<18-3,BECKETT>Yeah, remind me to notify the bird police.

459
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,490
<18-4,BECKETT>但我可不认为是鹰杀了他
<18-4,BECKETT>But I doubt it was the hawks that killed him.

460
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,460
<18-4,BECKETT>哇哦
<18-4,BECKETT>Whoa.

461
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,340
<18-6,BECKETT>灯泡雷恩目击了一宗儿童诱拐案
<18-6,BECKETT>Lightbulb Len witnessed a child abduction.

462
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,500
<18-7,CASTLE>他最后看到的是凶手
<18-7,CASTLE>And the last thing he saw was his killer.

463
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,770
<18-7,CASTLE>我们不知道他的姓名和年龄
<18-7,CASTLE>We don't know his name or age,

464
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,660
<19-1,BECKETT>但我们估计是10至12岁
<19-1,BECKETT>but we're estimating between 10 and 12 years old.

465
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,900
<19-1,BECKETT>他棕色头发和淡褐色眼睛  最后看见时
<19-1,BECKETT>He has brown hair, hazel eyes, and was last seen

466
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,750
<19-1,BECKETT>身穿短裤  运动鞋和灰白夹克
<19-1,BECKETT>wearing shorts, sneakers, and a gray and white jacket.

467
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,080
<19-1,BECKETT>我们的绑匪是名男性  棕色头发
<19-1,BECKETT>Now our kidnapper is male, brown hair,

468
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,500
<19-1,BECKETT>身高175至180
<19-1,BECKETT>between 5'10" and 6".

469
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,360
<19-1,BECKETT>他携带一支格洛克45口径手枪
<19-1,BECKETT>He was carrying a Glock .45,

470
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,350
<19-1,BECKETT>和我们在被害人身上发现的
<19-1,BECKETT>which matches the size of the slugs

471
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
<19-1,BECKETT>子弹口径相吻合
<19-1,BECKETT>that we found in our victim's body.

472
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,550
<19-1,BECKETT>两张照片上都有时间显示
<19-1,BECKETT>Now both photos have time stamps on them,

473
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,030
<19-1,BECKETT>因此诱拐案发生在周二晚上12点
<19-1,BECKETT>so we know that the abduction took place 12 pm on Tuesday.

474
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,470
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>48小时后  被绑儿童生还的机会
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>After 48 hours, the chances of finding a child abduction

475
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,470
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>很小很小
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>victim alive go way down.

476
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,680
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>最重要的是找到那个孩子
<19-2,MONTGOMERY>The only thing that matters is finding that kid.

477
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,730
<19-3,CASTLE>如果他失踪了36小时
<19-3,CASTLE>If he's been missing for 36 hours,

478
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,950
<19-3,CASTLE>为什么他的父母还不来报案
<19-3,CASTLE>how come his parents haven't reported it?

479
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,950
<19-4,BECKETT>他们可能不知道
<19-4,BECKETT>They might not know.

480
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,930
<19-4,BECKETT>也许他们在别人挟持下
<19-4,BECKETT>Or they might be under duress.

481
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,400
<19-5,CASTLE>他身穿短裤
<19-5,CASTLE>He was wearing shorts,

482
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,220
<19-5,CASTLE>很可能意味着他知道自已要去公园
<19-5,CASTLE>which probably means he knew he was going to the park.

483
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,160
<19-6,BECKETT>如果他不是被诱骗的
<19-6,BECKETT>Well, if he wasn't lured there,

484
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,460
<19-6,BECKETT>也许他认识绑匪
<19-6,BECKETT>maybe he knew his kidnapper.

485
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,030
<19-7,CASTLE>但为什么绑匪需要枪呢
<19-7,CASTLE>But then why would the kidnapper need a gun?

486
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,260
<19-8,RYAN>我给纽约州警察和假释部门电邮了照片
<19-8,RYAN>I e-mailed the photo to the New York state police

487
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,740
<19-8,RYAN>他们正在调查
<19-8,RYAN>and the parole division. They're looking into

488
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,740
<19-8,RYAN>与这起绑架案手法相似的绑匪资料
<19-8,RYAN>any kidnappers with this abduction M.O.

489
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,500
<19-8,RYAN>埃斯波西托正在公园里
<19-8,RYAN>And Esposito is canvassing that part of the park

490
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,770
<19-8,RYAN>寻找目击证人
<19-8,RYAN>looking for any witnesses.

491
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,430
<19-9,CASTLE>学校那边有什么消息
<19-9,CASTLE>Well, what about schools?

492
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,920
<19-9,CASTLE>如果这孩子上的是当地学校
<19-9,CASTLE>If the boy goes to a local school,

493
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,920
<19-9,CASTLE>他们会知道他缺席了
<19-9,CASTLE>they'd know he was absent.

494
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,910
<19-10,BECKETT>让警员把他的照片
<19-10,BECKETT>Have uniforms fax his photo to

495
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,940
<19-10,BECKETT>-传真给5个区内所有的学校  -收到
<19-10,BECKETT>- all schools in the five boroughs. - Done.

496
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,040
<19-12,CASTLE>那辆车看起来像小型或超小型汽车
<19-12,CASTLE>That car looks to be, like, a compact or a subcompact.

497
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,270
<19-12,CASTLE>我们能判断出厂牌或是车型吗
<19-12,CASTLE>Can we get the make or model?

498
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,750
<19-13,BECKETT>实验室已经在调查了
<19-13,BECKETT>Lab's already looking into it.

499
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,980
<19-14,RYAN>我们把周二晚上进出公园
<19-14,RYAN>We're pulling video from all traffic cameras on the streets

500
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,760
<19-14,RYAN>所有街边的交通录像都调出来
<19-14,RYAN>leading in and out of the park on Tuesday evening.

501
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,740
<19-14,RYAN>-也许有拍到车牌  -或司机的样子
<19-14,RYAN>- Maybe we'll catch a license plate. - Or the driver's face.

502
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,410
<19-16,CASTLE>要是我们放大相片的这一小块怎样
<19-16,CASTLE>What if we were to enlarge this part of the photo--

503
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,970
<19-16,CASTLE>不包括人脸  仅是车窗这块
<19-16,CASTLE>not the face, just this part of the window?

504
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,670
<19-17,BECKETT>你觉得玻璃映出了司机的样子
<19-17,BECKETT>Are you thinking of the reflection?

505
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,670
<19-18,CASTLE>我在想  也许我们能通过后视镜看到
<19-18,CASTLE>I'm wondering if maybe we can see the kidnapper's face

506
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,560
<19-18,CASTLE>-绑匪的样子  -值得一试
<19-18,CASTLE>- in that side view mirror. - It's worth a shot.

507
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,620
<19-20,BECKETT>请马上派鉴证组图像处理技术员过来
<19-20,BECKETT>I need a C.S.U. photo tech up here now.

508
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,860
<20-1,ESPOSITO>你确定你没见过他
<20-1,ESPOSITO>You sure you haven't seen him?

509
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,130
<20-2,VENDOR>老兄  我每天都能看到一堆小孩
<20-2,VENDOR>Man, I see so many kids every day,

510
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,000
<20-2,VENDOR>但根本分不清谁跟谁
<20-2,VENDOR>I couldn't tell one from the next.

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,050
<20-3,ESPOSITO>那在同一时间
<20-3,ESPOSITO>What about a blue car

512
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
<20-3,ESPOSITO>你有在这附近见过一部蓝色小车吗
<20-3,ESPOSITO>around the same time, somewhere in this area?

513
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,210
<20-4,VENDOR>-周二下午5点吗  -对
<20-4,VENDOR>- Tuesday about 5:00? - Yeah.

514
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,860
<20-5,ESPOSITO>-有啊  那是一辆蓝色的土星车  -确定吗
<20-5,ESPOSITO>- Yeah, as a matter of fact, a blue saturn. - You sure?

515
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,800
<20-7,ESPOSITO>当然  人我记不住
<20-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah. People I forget.

516
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,890
<20-8,VENDOR>但妨碍我做生意的车我可记忆犹新
<20-8,VENDOR>Things that get in my way, I remember.

517
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,440
<20-8,VENDOR>它就停在我地盘的前面
<20-8,VENDOR>It was parked right in front of my regular spot.

518
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,670
<20-8,VENDOR>结果我只好把摊摆在马路旁
<20-8,VENDOR>Instead, I gotta set up at the edge of the roadway.

519
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,270
<20-8,VENDOR>-害我差点被的士撞倒  -车里有人吗
<20-8,VENDOR>- I almost get clipped by a cab. - Anybody inside?

520
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,760
<20-10,VENDOR>没有  不然我肯定会骂他祖宗
<20-10,VENDOR>No, because I woulda yelled at the driver if there was.

521
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,650
<20-10,VENDOR>我真搞不懂这城市的人有啥毛病
<20-10,VENDOR>I don't know what's wrong with people in this city.

522
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,970
<20-11,ESPOSITO>-谢了  -不用
<20-11,ESPOSITO>- Yeah, thanks. - Yeah.

523
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,790
<21-1,BECKETT>咸酥饼小贩认出了绑匪的车
<21-1,BECKETT>Our pretzel vendor I.D.'ed the kidnapper's car

524
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,410
<21-1,BECKETT>是一辆蓝色土星轿车  年份是97年到02年
<21-1,BECKETT>as a blue saturn sedan, anywhere from '97 to '02.

525
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,590
<21-1,BECKETT>问题是
<21-1,BECKETT>The problem is,

526
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,790
<21-1,BECKETT>单是一个三州区就登记了
<21-1,BECKETT>there are 6,000 blue saturns registered

528
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,400
<21-1,BECKETT>6千辆蓝色土星车
<21-1,BECKETT>in the tristate area alone.

529
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,020
<21-1,BECKETT>莱恩  交通监控摄像查得怎样了
<21-1,BECKETT>Ryan, where are we on the traffic cams?

530
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,950
<21-2,RYAN>要是有厂牌和型号就能缩小范围
<21-2,RYAN>The make and model will help narrow it down,

531
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,320
<21-2,RYAN>但现在录像还是很多
<21-2,RYAN>but there's a lot of footage.

532
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,610
<21-2,RYAN>另外  学校没有对缺勤建立中心数据库
<21-2,RYAN>There's also no central database for school absences.

533
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,640
<21-2,RYAN>我们无法按年级或性别检索
<21-2,RYAN>We can't sort by grade or gender,

534
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,130
<21-2,RYAN>而且最近在流行重感冒
<21-2,RYAN>and there's a bad cold making the rounds,

535
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,090
<21-2,RYAN>学校比平常多了学生缺席
<21-2,RYAN>so more kids are out than usual.

536
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,380
<21-3,CASTLE>那州警那边有消息吗
<21-3,CASTLE>What about state police?

537
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,240
<21-4,RYAN>没有  也没有查到
<21-4,RYAN>Whole lot of nada, and nothing popped

538
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,840
<21-4,RYAN>绑架手法相似的假释犯
<21-4,RYAN>on parolees with the same kidnapping MO.

539
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,850
<21-4,RYAN>好的  我会继续等着
<21-4,RYAN>Yes, I'll continue to hold.

540
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,430
<21-5,CSU TECH>-警探  相片放大过了  -谢谢
<21-5,CSU TECH>- Detective, enhanced and enlarged. - Thank you.

541

00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,140
<26-3,CASTLE>真不敢想象泰勒母亲的心情
<26-3,CASTLE>I can't imagine how Tyler's mother feels.

643
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,100
<26-4,BECKETT>对啊  我也是
<26-4,BECKETT>Yeah, me neither.

644
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,450
<26-5,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯四岁时  我们一起去白原市的
<26-5,CASTLE>When Alexis was 4, we went christmas shopping

645
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,540
<26-5,CASTLE>商场做圣诞采购
<26-5,CASTLE>at some mall in--in white plains.

646
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:42,410
<26-5,CASTLE>我正在试戴深灰色的软毡帽
<26-5,CASTLE>I was trying on some charcoal fedora.

647
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,640
<26-5,CASTLE>一回头  发现她人不见了
<26-5,CASTLE>I turn around, she is gone, vanished.

648
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,630
<26-5,CASTLE>我四处寻找  跟商场保安
<26-5,CASTLE>I looked everywhere, so did mall security,

649
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,370
<26-5,CASTLE>和警察一块
<26-5,CASTLE>so did the police.

650
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,950
<26-5,CASTLE>我们足足找了一个小时
<26-5,CASTLE>We searched for an hour.

651
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,070
<26-5,CASTLE>用不着当小说家
<26-5,CASTLE>You don't have to be a novelist

652
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,680
<26-5,CASTLE>也能想象出所有最坏的情况
<26-5,CASTLE>to think of all the worst-case scenarios.

653
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,630
<26-6,BECKETT>后来你在哪里找到她呢
<26-6,BECKETT>Where'd you find her?

654
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,190
<26-7,CASTLE>一架子冬季外套后面  她觉得无聊
<26-7,CASTLE>Behind a rack of winter coats. She got bored.

655
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,640
<26-7,CASTLE>就爬进那底下睡觉去了
<26-7,CASTLE>She crawled underneath there and went to sleep.

656
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,060
<26-8,CASTLE>直到今天  我还会梦到这事
<26-8,CASTLE>To this day, I still dream about that.

657
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,860
<26-9,MONTGOMERY>刚跟埃斯波西托聊完  看来迪恩跑路了
<26-9,MONTGOMERY>Just got off with Esposito. Looks like Dean's on the move.

658
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,370
<26-10,BECKETT>他们找到了什么
<26-10,BECKETT>What did they find?

659
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,610
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>他们就是什么都没找到
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>It's what they didn't find--

660
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,820
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>浴室没牙刷  没除臭剂
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>no toothbrush, no deodorant,

661
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,290
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>也没沐浴液
<26-11,MONTGOMERY>no shampoo in the shower.

662
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,020
<26-12,BECKETT>我这就查他的信用卡
<26-12,BECKETT>I'll run his credit card

663
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,570
<26-12,BECKETT>看看他是否真的出游了
<26-12,BECKETT>for anything that indicates he's traveling.

664
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,450
<27-1,RYAN>这就是迪恩的办公桌吗
<27-1,RYAN>Dean's desk?

665
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,000
<27-2,TERESA DE LA TORRE>很难忽略对吧  贴满了照片
<27-2,TERESA DE LA TORRE>You can't miss it, right? Pictures everywhere.

666
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,810
<27-2,TERESA DE LA TORRE>他称之为泰勒嘉年华
<27-2,TERESA DE LA TORRE>He calls it Tyler-palooza.

667
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,260
<27-3,RYAN>他只在这里工作吗
<27-3,RYAN>Is this his only work area?

668
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,200
<27-4,TERESA>是的  没错
<27-4,TERESA>Yeah. Uh-huh.

669
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,520
<27-5,RYAN>他请病假的时候听起来怎么样
<27-5,RYAN>How'd he sound when he called in sick?

670
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,850
<27-5,RYAN>他听上去  紧张吗
<27-5,RYAN>Did he sound... Stressed?

671
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,440
<27-6,TERESA>说实话  警探  迪恩没有打来请假
<27-6,TERESA>Tell you the truth, detective, Dean didn't call in sick.

672
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,530
<27-6,TERESA>-我替他找了个借口  -为什么
<27-6,TERESA>- I covered for him. - Why?

673
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,650
<27-8,TERESA>他的前妻在正式离婚后五分钟
<27-8,TERESA>His ex-wife got remarried to some rich doctor

674
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,720
<27-8,TERESA>就跑去跟有钱的医生结婚了
<27-8,TERESA>like five minutes after the divorce was final.

675
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,660
<27-8,TERESA>他欠了一屁股债
<27-8,TERESA>He had legal bills up the ass.

676
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,870
<27-8,TERESA>我想他只是想多陪伴自己的儿子
<27-8,TERESA>I figured, he just needed to spend a little time with his son.

677
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,040
<27-8,TERESA>所以即使他没打电话
<27-8,TERESA>So what if he didn't call in sick?

678
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,550
<27-8,TERESA>我也会挺他  这是我们这里的做法
<27-8,TERESA>I had his back. That's how we do it down here.

683
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,230
<28-1,CASTLE>或许他有家人在印第安纳波利斯
<28-1,CASTLE>Maybe he's got family in Indianapolis,

684
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,930
<28-1,CASTLE>可以信任的朋友让他匿藏起来

<28-5,CASTLE>That's not far from the airport.

693
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,310
<28-5,CASTLE>他可能还在企图带走泰勒
<28-5,CASTLE>He might still be trying to get Tyler out of town.

694
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,030

838
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,170
<36-6,BECKETT>也许是没信号  或是信号不足
<36-6,BECKETT>Well, maybe there wasn't a signal or not enough bars.

839
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,110
<36-7,CASTLE>也许他们得走到很远的地方才有信号

00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,590
<36-7,CASTLE>艾斯不是人名
<36-7,CASTLE>It's not "Ace".

844
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,300
<36-9,CASTLE>而是字母a  c和e
<36-9,CASTLE>It's a-c-e --

845
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,880
<36-7,CASTLE>是指a  c  e号地铁线
<36-7,CASTLE>The a, c, and e subway lines.

846
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,960
<36-8,BECKETT>他们把Tyler囚禁在地铁站里
<36-8,BECKETT>They're holding Tyler in the subway.

847
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,620
<36-8,BECKETT>他肯定是看到了路标
<36-8,BECKETT>He must have spotted a sign.

848
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,130
<36-9,CASTLE>a  c  e号线上有太多地铁站了
<36-9,CASTLE>There's half a dozen stations where the a, c, and e stop.

849
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:16,820
<36-9,CASTLE>我们搜不过来的
<36-9,CASTLE>That's too many to search.

850
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,590
<36-10,BECKETT>没错  但是三条线的终点站
<36-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but the last stop for all three lines

851
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,700
<36-10,BECKETT>都在运河街和西百老汇街的交界处
<36-10,BECKETT>is on Canal Street and West Broadway.

852
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,930
<36-11,CASTLE>-那就在  -迪恩工作那栋楼的楼下
<36-11,CASTLE>- That's --  - Right under Dean's building.

853
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,150
<36-11,CASTLE>-他们把他藏在大家的眼皮底下  -我们走
<36-11,CASTLE>- They've been holding him under everyone's nose. - Let's go.

854
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,260
<37-1,BECKETT>搜查站台东面的每个房间
<37-1,BECKETT>Check every room on the east end of the station.

855
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,600
<37-1,BECKETT>你们几个去搜站台两边的售票厅  快去
<37-1,BECKETT>You guys, check ticket booths on both ends. Go.

856
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,560
<37-1,BECKETT>-好的  -收到
<37-1,BECKETT>- Right.  - Got it.

857
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,740
<37-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在想什么
<37-2,BECKETT>Castle, what are you thinking?

858
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,950
<37-3,CASTLE>把他关在这的唯一原因就是为了逃跑方便
<37-3,CASTLE>The only reason to keep him here is for a quick getaway,

859
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,840
<37-3,CASTLE>这里的便利条件就在于运河街680号
<37-3,CASTLE>which is helped by the fact that 680 Canal Street

860
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,150
<37-3,CASTLE>有独立的地铁入口
<37-3,CASTLE>has its own entrance to the subway.

861
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,750
<37-3,CASTLE>要是我的话  我就会选在一个
<37-3,CASTLE>If it were me...I'd keep close enough

862
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,690
<37-3,CASTLE>可以跟我的同伙保持联系
<37-3,CASTLE>to hook up with my partners

863
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,340
<37-3,CASTLE>却又不会碍事的地方
<37-3,CASTLE>but far enough that I would be out of the way.

864
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,320
<37-4,BECKETT>也就是说他把泰勒关在
<37-4,BECKETT>Which means he's holding Tyler

865
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,140
<37-4,BECKETT>隧道的西端
<37-4,BECKETT>on the west end of the tunnel.

866
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,900
<37-5,CASTLE>隧道西端吗  这个房间
<37-5,CASTLE>West end of the tunnel? This room.

868
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,770
<37-6,BECKETT>-好的  你在这等着  -没门儿
<37-6,BECKETT>- All right. You should stay back.  - No chance.

869
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,410
<38-1,RYAN>现在去三十七楼
<38-1,RYAN>"Go to the 37th floor now".

870
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
<38-2,DEAN>他们之前说三十分钟的
<38-2,DEAN>They said 30 minutes.

871
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
<38-2,DEAN>现在还没到三十分钟呢
<38-2,DEAN>It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.

872
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,110
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>他们在更改时间
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>They're changing the timetable

873
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,970
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>防止你去报警
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>in case you went to the cops.

874
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,210
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>三十七楼上有什么
<38-3,MONTGOMERY>What's on the 37th floor?

875
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,100
<38-4,DEAN>什么都没有  那层楼是空置的
<38-4,DEAN>Nothing. It's vacant.

876
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,730
<38-4,DEAN>连保安的没有
<38-4,DEAN>It's not even secure.

877
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,780
<38-5,MONTGOMERY>打给贝克特
<38-5,MONTGOMERY>Try Beckett.

878
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:36,910
<39-1,BECKETT>没人
<39-1,BECKETT>Nothing.

879
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,200
<39-1,BECKETT>直接转到留言信箱了
<39-1,BECKETT>It's going straight to voice mail.

880
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,190
<40-1,ESPOSITO>-她肯定已经下地铁站了  -我得走了
<40-1,ESPOSITO>- She must already be in the subway.  - I gotta go.

881
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,280
<40-2,DEAN>记住  我们看得见也听得见你的一切行为
<40-2,DEAN>Remember, we can see and hear everything.

882
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,190
<40-3,MONTGOMERY>一旦发生任何紧急情况
<40-3,MONTGOMERY>Anything goes south,

883
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,990
<40-3,MONTGOMERY>马上就会有一百名警察冲进去的
<40-3,MONTGOMERY>a hundred cops will be on you inside a minute.

884
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,690
<40-4,DEAN>找到我儿子之前不许有警察出现
<40-4,DEAN>Not until you find my son.

885
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,470
<40-4,DEAN>是我倒霉
<40-4,DEAN>Just my luck.

886
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,660
<41-1,DEAN>这么晚还得来加班
<41-1,DEAN>Pulled graveyard tonight.

887
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:10,710
<42-2,ESPOSITO>好的  他进去了
<42-2,ESPOSITO>All right. He's in.

888
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,970
<42-3,RYAN>他跟保安表现得挺自然的  他没事
<42-3,RYAN>Not bad with the guard. Guy's all right.

889
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,000
<42-4,RYAN>摄像头和麦克风都好用
<42-4,RYAN>Camera and mic are all good.

890
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,900
<42-5,DEAN>-带我们到三十九楼  -我要先见泰勒
<42-5,DEAN>- Take us to the 39th floor.  - I want to see Tyler first.

891
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,250
<42-6,ROBERT KINCADE>乖乖听话  你很快就会见到他的
<42-6,ROBERT KINCADE>Just follow instructions. You'll see him soon enough.

892
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,620
<42-7,MONTGOMERY>三十九楼有什么
<42-7,MONTGOMERY>What's on the 39th floor?

893
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,420
<42-8,RYAN>一间金融公司  布瑞金&怀特
<42-8,RYAN>A financial firm -- Breskin & Wright.

894
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,610
<42-9,ESPOSITO>三十七楼只是个幌子
<42-9,ESPOSITO>37 was just a staging area.

895
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,310
<42-10,MONTGOMERY>他们没有蒙面  也就是说他们一旦
<42-10,MONTGOMERY>They let him see their faces. As soon as they get

896
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,540
<42-10,MONTGOMERY>达到目的以后  就会杀了他
<42-10,MONTGOMERY>what they came for, they're gonna kill him.

897
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,560
<42-11,ESPOSITO>就像灯泡雷恩一样
<42-11,ESPOSITO>Just like Lightbulb Len.

898
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,210
<42-12,RYAN>贝克特的电话还是转到语言信箱  卡塞尔的也是
<42-12,RYAN>Beckett's still going to voice mail. Castle, too.

899
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,490
<42-13,ESPOSITO>头  下一步怎么办
<42-13,ESPOSITO>Sir...what do you want to do?

900
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,690
<42-14,MONTGOMERY>要是我们在找到那个孩子之前冲进去
<42-14,MONTGOMERY>If we go in before we find the kid,

901
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,380
<42-14,MONTGOMERY>我们可能会害死他们两个
<42-14,MONTGOMERY>we might lose 'em both.

903
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,050
<43-2,BECKETT>一名持械绑匪  还有那个孩子
<43-2,BECKETT>One armed and the kid.

904
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,450
<43-2,BECKETT>如果我冲进去的话
<43-2,BECKETT>If I go in, he'll kill him

905
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,690
<43-2,BECKETT>在我开枪之前他就会杀了那个孩子
<43-2,BECKETT>before I get a shot off.

906
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,770
<43-3,CASTLE>他拿着个手电筒
<43-3,CASTLE>He's holding a flashlight.

907
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,410
<43-3,CASTLE>如果我们把周围的灯都关了
<43-3,CASTLE>If we kill the ambient light,

908
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,300
<43-3,CASTLE>他就会成为唯一的光源
<43-3,CASTLE>he'll light up like a Christmas tree.

909
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,610
<43-3,CASTLE>我们只要
<43-3,CASTLE>We just...

910
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,920
<43-4,CASTLE>看来这是注定的了
<43-4,CASTLE>It's like it's meant to be.

911
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,810
<43-5,BECKETT>也许雷恩可以避免另一场悲剧
<43-5,BECKETT>Maybe Lenny can prevent another tragedy.

912
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,320
<43-5,BECKETT>听我数
<43-5,BECKETT>On my count.

913
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,550
<43-6,BECKETT>三  二
<43-6,BECKETT>Three, two...

914
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,670
<43-6,BECKETT>一
<43-6,BECKETT>one.

915
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,430
<43-6,BECKETT>按负一楼  下地铁站
<43-6,BECKETT>Hit p-1. The subway.

916
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,820
<44-1,DEAN>我都按你说的做了  泰勒人呢
<44-1,DEAN>I did what you asked. Now where's Tyler?

917
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,160
<44-2,ROBERT>你一会就会见到他了
<44-2,ROBERT>You'll see him in a minute.

918
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,450
<44-2,ROBERT>对不起了  迪恩
<44-2,ROBERT>Sorry, Dean.

919
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,790
<44-3,ROBERT>这是你的最后一站
<44-3,ROBERT>Last stop.

920
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:48,520
<44-3,ROBERT>大堂
<44-3,ROBERT>Lobby.

921
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,880
<44-3,ROBERT>我们应该到地铁站那层的
<44-3,ROBERT>We're supposed to go to subway level.

922
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,140
<44-3,ROBERT>为什么在大堂停了
<44-3,ROBERT>Why are we stopping at the lobby?

923
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,220
<44-4,MONTGOMERY>别看我
<44-4,MONTGOMERY>Don't look at me.

924
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,080
<44-4,MONTGOMERY>没错  看我吧
<44-4,MONTGOMERY>No, look at me.

925
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,810
<44-5,MONTGOMERY>我建议你们放下武器
<44-5,MONTGOMERY>I suggest you drop your weapons.

926
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,170
<44-5,MONTGOMERY>泰勒在哪
<44-5,MONTGOMERY>Where's Tyler?

927
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,340
<45-1,BECKETT>罪魁祸首是罗伯特·金凯德
<45-1,BECKETT>The ringleader was Robert Kincaid...

928
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,560
<45-1,BECKETT>前任的证券交易员
<45-1,BECKETT>former bond trader.

929
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,340
<45-1,BECKETT>他策划了整个行动
<45-1,BECKETT>He's the one who planned the entire operation.

930
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,360
<45-1,BECKETT>经济虽然崩盘了
<45-1,BECKETT>The economy might have collapsed,

931
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,280
<45-1,BECKETT>但他还是想要捞一笔
<45-1,BECKETT>but he was still gonna get his payday.

932
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,750
<45-1,BECKETT>他们大多数都是以前的华尔街大亨
<45-1,BECKETT>Most of them were ex wall streeters.

933
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,640
<45-1,BECKETT>他们知道要是没有开门人的话
<45-1,BECKETT>They knew that they needed a biometric clearance in order

934
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,000
<45-1,BECKETT>他们是去不了安保楼层的
<45-1,BECKETT>to get on secure floors,

935
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,230
<45-1,BECKETT>而且他们也知道迪恩不会帮他们的
<45-1,BECKETT>and they knew that Dean wasn't gonna help them,

936
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,910
<45-1,BECKETT>所以他们就抓了泰勒作为筹码
<45-1,BECKETT>so they took Tyler as leverage.

937
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,300
<45-2,ESPOSITO>但是他们偷的只是一些文件而已
<45-2,ESPOSITO>But all they took were files.

938
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,900
<45-3,CASTLE>那是财务文件  包括未公布的收益报表
<45-3,CASTLE>Financial files, containing unpublished earnings reports.

939
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,270
<45-3,CASTLE>对明智的投资者来说  这些文件值上百万
<45-3,CASTLE>To a savvy investor, they'd be worth millions.

940
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,600
<45-4,RYAN>要是灯泡雷恩没在公园里
<45-4,RYAN>Would've worked, too, if Lightbulb Len hadn't have been

941
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,860
<45-4,RYAN>拍到那些照片的话  计划本来是会成功的
<45-4,RYAN>taking pictures in the park.

942
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,000
<45-4,RYAN>他帮我们抓到了杀他自己的凶手
<45-4,RYAN>He helped catch his own killer.

943
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,820
<45-5,CASTLE>还制止了一起绑架案
<45-5,CASTLE>And foiled a kidnapping.

944
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,390
<45-5,CASTLE>这还真是有诗意
<45-5,CASTLE>It's kind of poetic...

945
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,360
<45-6,CASTLE>当然是难以形容的悲剧诗意啦
<45-6,CASTLE>in an unspeakably tragic sort of way.

946
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,290
<45-7,MONTGOMERY>你在地铁站里打伤的那个家伙
<45-7,MONTGOMERY>The guy you shot in the subway?

947
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,420
<45-7,MONTGOMERY>金凯德雇来的那个恶棍
<45-7,MONTGOMERY>The thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.

948
