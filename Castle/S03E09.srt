<2-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Feeling cocky today, are we?

<2-4,MARTHA>儿子  她听不到你说话
<2-4,MARTHA>She doesn't hear you, darling.

13
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,590
<2-4,MARTHA>她还在跟阿什利讲电话
<2-4,MARTHA>She's still talking to Ashley.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,980
<2-5,CASTLE>我真该算算这通电话的时长
<2-5,CASTLE>I should be timing that phone call.

<2-6,MARTHA>I've had relationships that didn't last this long.

17
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,310
<2-7,CASTLE>那是
<2-7,CASTLE>True.

18
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,800
<2-7,CASTLE>好的  拜拜
<2-7,CASTLE>Okay. Bye.

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,580
<2-8,ALEXIS>抱歉  我们正在聊下周六远足的事
<2-8,ALEXIS>Sorry. We were talking about the hiking trip next Saturday.

20
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,430
<2-9,CASTLE>那阿什利征得父母同意让他
<2-9,CASTLE>Oh, has Ashley got the all clear from his parents

21
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,140
<2-9,CASTLE>随我们出游吗
<2-9,CASTLE>to come with us?

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,500
<2-10,ALEXIS>他父母说想先见见你
<2-10,ALEXIS>They say they want to meet you first.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,930
<2-11,CASTLE>他们一定是想好好审视我
<2-11,CASTLE>Ah, they want to vet me to make sure

24
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,690
<2-11,CASTLE>怕我在遭遇岩崩等灾难时
<2-11,CASTLE>if there's some kind of rock slide,

25
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,630
<2-11,CASTLE>扔下他们的乖儿子受困于山腰
<2-11,CASTLE>that I won't leave their boy stranded on a mountainside,

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,580
<2-11,CASTLE>害他只能咬断手臂逃生
<2-11,CASTLE>having to gnaw off his own arm to survive.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,700
<2-12,ALEXIS>那你肯去见面咯
<2-12,ALEXIS>So you'll do it?

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,560
<2-13,CASTLE>我们会请他们过来吃晚饭
<2-13,CASTLE>We'll have them over for dinner.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,950
<2-13,CASTLE>跟他们攀关系  留个好印象
<2-13,CASTLE>We'll schmooze and impress them.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,430
<2-14,MARTHA>你们需要我来下厨吗
<2-14,MARTHA>Would you like me to cook something?

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,130
<2-15,CASTLE>不用  我们想给人家留个好印象
<2-15,CASTLE>No, we want to impress them.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,170
<2-16,MARTHA>你这话是什么意思
<2-16,MARTHA>And what is that supposed to mean?

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,490
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>终于到了"见家长"环节了  卡塞尔
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>So it's "meet the parents" time, huh, Castle?

34
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,960
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>这对你来说是很关键的一刻
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>This is a pretty critical moment for you.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,910
<3-2,CASTLE>对我  为什么是我
<3-2,CASTLE>For me? Why me?

36
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,130
<3-3,BECKETT>我是说  阿什利是阿丽克西斯的初恋  对吧
<3-3,BECKETT>Well, I mean, Ashley is Alexis' first love, right?

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,120
<3-4,CASTLE>嗯
<3-4,CASTLE>Mm-hmm.

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,310
<3-5,BECKETT>那么  要是双方父母处不好
<3-5,BECKETT>Well, what do you think will happen

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,700
<3-5,BECKETT>你觉得会发生什么事呢
<3-5,BECKETT>if you don't get on with his parents?

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,550
<3-6,CASTLE>她会对他失去兴趣
<3-6,CASTLE>She'll lose interest in him?

41
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,410
<3-7,BECKETT>不对  恰恰相反
<3-7,BECKETT>Oh, no. The exact opposite.

42
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,690
<3-7,BECKETT>那只会让他们感到恋情受阻
<3-7,BECKETT>I mean, it'll make their romance feel forbidden,

43
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,490
<3-7,BECKETT>做出一些你想不到的事
<3-7,BECKETT>and they'll be off doing god knows what.

44
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,870
<3-7,BECKETT>相信我  我是过来人
<3-7,BECKETT>Trust me. I know.

45
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,090
<3-8,CASTLE>我从没往那方面想过
<3-8,CASTLE>I never thought of it that way.

46
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,570
<3-9,BECKETT>我的建议是和她男朋友走近点
<3-9,BECKETT>My advice is keep the boyfriend close

47
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,170
<3-9,BECKETT>和他的父母走更近点
<3-9,BECKETT>but the parents closer.

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,530
<3-10,BECKETT>嘿  伙计们
<3-10,BECKETT>Hey, guys.

49
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,270
<3-10,BECKETT>-是什么案子  -有人死了
<3-10,BECKETT>- What do we got? - Something messed up.

50
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,780
<3-11,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我从没见过这种死法
<3-11,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I've never seen anything like it.

51
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,430
<3-12,ESPOSITO>死者叫玛丽·苏巴拉奥  35岁
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Victim's name is Marie Subbarao. She's 35.

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,950
<3-12,ESPOSITO>保安昨晚发现她死于车内
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Security guard found her last night.

53
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,300
<3-12,ESPOSITO>人至今还没恢复过来
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Still getting over it.

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,410
<3-13,CASTLE>哇  她看上去好像撑胀了的腊肠
<3-13,CASTLE>Wow. She looks like an overstuffed sausage.

55
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,150
<3-14,BECKETT>蕾妮  她怎么会变成这样的
<3-14,BECKETT>Lanie, what the hell happened to her?

56
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,700
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>这叫暴发性减压
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>It's called explosive decompression.

57
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,800
<3-16,BECKETT>减什么压  什么造成的
<3-16,BECKETT>From what? What would cause this?

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,410
<3-17,LANIE>这是人体暴露在真空环境下的结果
<3-17,LANIE>It's a result of exposure to a zero-atmosphere environment.

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,930
<3-18,CASTLE>真空  外太空那种真空吗
<3-18,CASTLE>Zero atmosphere? As in... Outer space?

60
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,250
<3-19,LANIE>对
<3-19,LANIE>Yep.

61
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,340
<3-20,BECKETT>又或者是...
<3-20,BECKETT>Or?

62
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,920
<3-21,LANIE>亲爱的  我暂时给不出别的可能性
<3-21,LANIE>I don't have an "Or" for you right now, sweetie.

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,630
<3-21,LANIE>我要把她的尸体运回验尸房
<3-21,LANIE>I have to get her body back to the morgue,

64
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,740
<3-21,LANIE>才有可能得出别的结论
<3-21,LANIE>and then I may have some answers.

65
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,560
<3-22,BECKETT>行  那么她的尸体在车里
<3-22,BECKETT>Okay, well, her body's in a car

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,350
<3-22,BECKETT>车子停在铁路站场中间
<3-22,BECKETT>in the middle of the rail yard,

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,610
<3-22,BECKETT>显然她不是在外太空被杀的
<3-22,BECKETT>so clearly she wasn't killed in outer space.

68
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,760
<3-22,BECKETT>势必会有别的解释的
<3-22,BECKETT>There's gotta be another explanation.

69
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,430
<3-23,CASTLE>看看这个  她在看这本
<3-23,CASTLE>Check this out-- she was reading

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,740
<3-23,CASTLE>《第四类接触》  说的是外星人绑架的事
<3-23,CASTLE>"Taken by the fourth kind," a book on alien abductions.

71
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,630
<3-24,BECKETT>那你的想法是什么  卡塞尔
<3-24,BECKETT>So what's your theory, Castle,

72
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,670
<3-24,BECKETT>难不成她是遭外星人绑架并杀害的吗
<3-24,BECKETT>that she was abducted and then killed by aliens?

73
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,170
<3-25,CASTLE>更合理的说法应该是
<3-25,CASTLE>Mm. The story that makes more sense

74
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,010
<3-25,CASTLE>外星人绑架她时出了差错
<3-25,CASTLE>is, uh, alien abduction gone wrong--

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,410
<3-25,CASTLE>结果玛丽被意外炸出了
<3-25,CASTLE>one that ends with Marie being accidentally blasted

76
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,800
<3-25,CASTLE>外星飞船的气闸
<3-25,CASTLE>out of the air lock of the alien spaceship.

77
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,520
<3-26,ESPOSITO>要凶手真是外星人  他可是尼古丁成瘾者
<3-26,ESPOSITO>Well, if it was E.T., he has a nicotine addiction.

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,640
<3-26,ESPOSITO>我们在后轮胎旁找到这根烟蒂
<3-26,ESPOSITO>We found this cigarette butt by the rear tire.

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,190
<3-26,ESPOSITO>它就掉着车痕上
<3-26,ESPOSITO>It was laying in the track,

80
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,640
<3-26,ESPOSITO>也就是说这根烟蒂是停车后才扔掉的
<3-26,ESPOSITO>which means it was dropped after the car was parked.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,850
<3-27,BECKETT>好的  让鉴证人员检查上面的DNA
<3-27,BECKETT>All right. Well, have C.S.U. check for D.N.A.

82
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,060
<3-27,BECKETT>也许能查出疑犯
<3-27,BECKETT>Maybe we'll get lucky.

83
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,160
<3-27,BECKETT>另外  能不能查一下什么会造成
<3-27,BECKETT>And can you look into explosive decompression,

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,430
<3-27,BECKETT>-暴发性减压  -没问题
<3-27,BECKETT>- see what else might cause it? - You got it.

85
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,610
<3-29,BECKETT>谢谢
<3-29,BECKETT>Thank you.

86
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,780
<3-30,CASTLE>你不得不承认
<3-30,CASTLE>You do have to admit,

87
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,560
<3-30,CASTLE>她的死状看来确实很...超凡脱俗
<3-30,CASTLE>her condition does seem... otherworldly.

88
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,000
<3-30,CASTLE>玛丽·苏巴拉奥
<3-30,CASTLE>Marie Subbarao...

89
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,390
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>生前的样子
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>the before version.

90
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,570
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>在芝加哥出生
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>Born in Chicago,

91
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,310
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>是约翰霍普金斯大学的研究生
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>did postgrad work at Johns Hopkins,

92
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,940
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>在两年前
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>then two years ago,

93
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,340
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>她在市中心的奥布里科学中心找到一份
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>she takes a job at the Aubrey Science Center in midtown

94
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,420
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>天体物理学家的工作
<4-1,KEVIN RYAN>as an astrophysicist.

95
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,190
<4-2,BECKETT>具体是做什么呢
<4-2,BECKETT>Doing what?

96
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,410
<4-3,RYAN>我也不太确定
<4-3,RYAN>I'm not really sure.

97
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,640
<4-3,RYAN>根据中心官网说
<4-3,RYAN>According to the center's web site,

98
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,000
<4-3,RYAN>她最近得到SETI学会的一笔拨款
<4-3,RYAN>she recently landed a grant from the SETI Institute.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,980
<4-4,CASTLE>是指"搜寻地外文明计划"么
<4-4,CASTLE>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence SETI?

100
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,000
<4-4,CASTLE>-那就解释了...  -解释不了
<4-4,CASTLE>- That could explain why-- - No, it couldn't.

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,450
<4-6,CASTLE>那她为SETI工作只是一个难得的巧合吗
<4-6,CASTLE>So her working for SETI is just a wild coincidence?

102
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,300
<4-7,BECKETT>听我说  这只是一个跟本案
<4-7,BECKETT>I'm saying, it's an interesting fact

103
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,280
<4-7,BECKETT>无关的有趣的事实
<4-7,BECKETT>that is unrelated to our case.

104
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,330
<4-7,BECKETT>外星人跟玛丽·苏巴拉奥的死毫无关系
<4-7,BECKETT>Aliens were not involved in Marie Subbarao's death.

105
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,990
<4-8,RYAN>这很难说
<4-8,RYAN>Uh, I don't know.

106
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,140
<4-9,CASTLE>怎么说呢  莱恩警探
<4-9,CASTLE>Why, detective Ryan,

107
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,900
<4-9,CASTLE>没想到你也相信有外星人
<4-9,CASTLE>I never figured you for a believer.

108
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,250
<4-10,RYAN>我只记得一件事  某天晚上我爸的表亲
<4-10,RYAN>All I know is, my father's cousin Raymond

109
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,740
<4-10,RYAN>雷蒙德离开在纽泽西的聚会后
<4-10,RYAN>left this party in Jersey one night.

110
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,660
<4-10,RYAN>就在开车回皇后区途中  突然间
<4-10,RYAN>He's driving back to Queens, and bam!

111
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,680
<4-10,RYAN>一团刺眼的白光从天而降
<4-10,RYAN>Blinding bright light comes down from the sky,

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
<4-10,RYAN>当他醒来时  已是早上
<4-10,RYAN>next thing he knows, it's morning,

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,390
<4-10,RYAN>自己则躺在纽泽西高速公路旁
<4-10,RYAN>he's on the side of the Jersey turnpike.

114
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,820
<4-11,CASTLE>我来猜猜  事后他什么都不记得了
<4-11,CASTLE>Let me guess. No memory of what happened.

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,060
<4-12,BECKETT>那不叫外星人绑架
<4-12,BECKETT>That is not called an alien abduction.

116
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,230
<4-12,BECKETT>那叫宿醉
<4-12,BECKETT>That is called a hangover.

117
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,240
<4-12,BECKETT>有可能
<4-12,BECKETT>Maybe.

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,780
<4-13,RYAN>因为雷蒙德一直是家里最无足轻重的人
<4-13,RYAN>Raymond always was the lightweight in the family.

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,190
<4-14,BECKETT>说到家庭
<4-14,BECKETT>Speaking of family,

120
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,170
<4-14,BECKETT>本案的死者有家人吗  结婚了吗
<4-14,BECKETT>did our victim have any, a husband maybe?

121
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,930
<4-15,RYAN>邻居说她未婚  是一个人住
<4-15,RYAN>Neighbors say she was single and lived alone.

122
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,920
<4-15,RYAN>他们很少见到她
<4-15,RYAN>They barely saw her.

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,820
<4-15,RYAN>显然她一般是
<4-15,RYAN>Apparently, she normally came home

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,620
<4-15,RYAN>晚上10点左右下班回到家
<4-15,RYAN>from work around 10:00 P.M.

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,630
<4-16,BECKETT>蕾妮说死亡时间是晚上9点左右
<4-16,BECKETT>Lanie said that the time of death was around 9:00 P.M.,

126
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,220
<4-16,BECKETT>也就是说公司也许是最后一个
<4-16,BECKETT>which means work was the last place

127
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,920
<4-16,BECKETT>有人见到她还活着的地方
<4-16,BECKETT>that she was probably seen alive.

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
<4-16,BECKETT>太难以置信了
<4-16,BECKETT>This is unbelievable.

129
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,050
<4-16,BECKETT>玛丽是公司最具天赋的研究员之一
<4-16,BECKETT>Marie was one of my most gifted researchers.

130
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,630
<5-1,BECKETT>她在这里具体从事什么工作
<5-1,BECKETT>What did she do here exactly?

131
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,320
<5-2,VAUGHN>她负责分析从新墨西哥的
<5-2,VAUGHN>Uh, she analyzed the data

132
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,600
<5-2,VAUGHN>射电望远镜接收到的数据
<5-2,VAUGHN>fed in from our radio telescope in New Mexico,

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
<5-2,VAUGHN>研究类星射电源的辐射
<5-2,VAUGHN>studying radiation from quasars.

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,050
<5-3,CASTLE>是为SETI学会做研究吗
<5-3,CASTLE>For the SETI institute?

136
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,870
<5-4,VAUGHN>不  她的大部分工作与美国太空总署相关
<5-4,VAUGHN>No. Most of her work was NASA related.

137
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,230
<5-5,BECKETT>你最后一次见到她是在什么时候
<5-5,BECKETT>And when was the last time you saw her?

138
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,570
<5-6,VAUGHN>昨晚
<5-6,VAUGHN>Uh, last night.

139
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,350
<5-6,VAUGHN>我7点下班时她还在办公室里
<5-6,VAUGHN>She was still here at her office at 7 when I left.

140
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,230
<6-1,BECKETT>那么你呢  豪德小姐
<6-1,BECKETT>And what about you, Ms. Holder?

141
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,380
<6-2,AYYANA HOLDER>噢  我们查看了下周的日程表
<6-2,AYYANA HOLDER>Oh, we went over the calendar for next week,

142
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,180
<6-2,AYYANA HOLDER>然后在7:30她就让我下班了
<6-2,AYYANA HOLDER>and then she sent me home at 7:30.

143
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,200
<6-3,BECKETT>她有没有什么生活上的问题
<6-3,BECKETT>Was she having any problems in life?

144
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,620
<6-3,BECKETT>她最近有反常的举动吗
<6-3,BECKETT>Anything unusual happening lately?

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
<6-4,VAUGHN>我没看出什么不妥
<6-4,VAUGHN>Not that I'm aware of.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,310
<6-4,VAUGHN>其实...
<6-4,VAUGHN>Actually...

147
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,280
<6-5,AYYANA>从周一开始  她就表现得十分紧张不安
<6-5,AYYANA>since Monday, she'd been acting anxious and uptight.

148
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,070
<6-5,AYYANA>我后来问她发生什么事了  她说
<6-5,AYYANA>I finally asked her what was wrong, and she said

149
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,190
<6-5,AYYANA>她正经历着命运的大转折
<6-5,AYYANA>that something life-changing had happened to her.

150
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,910
<6-6,CASTLE>-什么转折  -我不知道
<6-6,CASTLE>- What was it? - I don't know.

151
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,410
<6-7,AYYANA>然后到了周三  她在中午便早早下班
<6-7,AYYANA>Then on Wednesday, she left work in the middle of the day.

152
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,730
<6-7,AYYANA>直到周四早上才见到她人
<6-7,AYYANA>She didn't come back until Thursday morning.

153
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,400
<6-7,AYYANA>沃恩博士  玛丽的尸体
<6-7,AYYANA>Dr. Vaughn, Marie's body

154
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,630
<6-8,BECKETT>表现出暴发性减压的症候
<6-8,BECKETT>showed signs of explosive decompression.

155
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,920
<6-8,BECKETT>她有没有在进行什么
<6-8,BECKETT>Was she doing any kind of research

156
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,060
<6-8,BECKETT>与此相关的研究呢
<6-8,BECKETT>that would account for that?

157
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,180
<6-9,VAUGHN>我的天啊
<6-9,VAUGHN>Oh, my god.

158
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,510
<6-10,CASTLE>那是"有"的意思
<6-10,CASTLE>That's a yes.

159
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,980
<7-1,VAUGHN>这是一个高空模拟低压舱
<7-1,VAUGHN>It's called an altitude chamber.

160
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,930
<7-1,VAUGHN>我们用它来为美国太空总署
<7-1,VAUGHN>We use it to study

161
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,490
<7-1,VAUGHN>研究减压环境下的
<7-1,VAUGHN>thermal life support systems

162
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,050
<7-1,VAUGHN>热控生命保障系统
<7-1,VAUGHN>under reduced pressure for NASA.

163
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,730
<7-2,BECKETT>如果人跑到里面会发生什么事
<7-2,BECKETT>What would happen if a person went inside?

164
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,160
<7-3,AYYANA>没穿保护装置的话
<7-3,AYYANA>Without protective gear?

165
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,880
<7-4,BECKETT>肺部会因气体膨胀而破裂
<7-4,BECKETT>Your lungs rupture from gas expansion

166
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,690
<7-5,AYYANA>人体内所有水分都会被蒸发掉
<7-5,AYYANA>and all the liquid in your body evaporates.

167
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,840
<7-6,CASTLE>也就是除去看不到外太空  能感受到
<7-6,CASTLE>So all the horrible effects of outer space

168
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,090
<7-6,CASTLE>外太空的一切可怕效应
<7-6,CASTLE>without the view.

169
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,570
<7-7,BECKETT>谁有权进入这个区域
<7-7,BECKETT>Who else had access to this area?

170
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,530
<7-8,VAUGHN>大多数研究员及其助手都可以
<7-8,VAUGHN>Mostly our researchers and their assistants.

171
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,260
<7-8,VAUGHN>总共  大概35人
<7-8,VAUGHN>Maybe 35 people in all.

172
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,780
<7-9,BECKETT>我需要他们所有人的名单
<7-9,BECKETT>I'll need a list of all of their names.

173
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,350
<7-9,BECKETT>玛丽跟他们任何人有过节吗
<7-9,BECKETT>Did Marie have problems with any of them?

174
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,740
<7-9,BECKETT>泰德·卡特
<7-9,BECKETT>Ted Carter...

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,940
<7-10,AYYANA>他们分手后  闹得很难看
<7-10,AYYANA>After their breakup, things got ugly between them.

177
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,220
<8-1,TED>能问问找我来有何贵干吗
<8-1,TED>Can I ask what this is about?

178
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,380
<8-1,TED>卡特先生
<8-1,TED>Mr. Carter...

<8-2,RYAN>昨晚7:42  你曾刷卡
<8-2,RYAN>Your key card was swiped at the science center

180
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,000
<8-2,RYAN>进入了科技馆
<8-2,RYAN>last night at 7:42.

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,780
<8-2,RYAN>能告诉我们你为何要去那里吗
<8-2,RYAN>You mind tell us what you were doing there?

<8-3,TED>-我是去找人的  -玛丽  苏巴拉奥吗
<8-3,TED>- I went to see someone.  - Marie Subbarao?

183
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,180
<8-5,TED>这与你们有何相干
<8-5,TED>Why is this any of your business?

184
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,880
<8-6,ESPOSITO>我们在调查她的谋杀案
<8-6,ESPOSITO>We're investigating her murder.

185
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,620
<8-6,ESPOSITO>什么
<8-6,ESPOSITO>What?

186
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,700
<8-7,TED>玛丽又没死
<8-7,TED>Marie's not dead.

187
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,060
<8-7,TED>她怎么可能死了
<8-7,TED>How could she be dead?

188
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,010
<8-8,ESPOSITO>有人把她关进了低压舱
<8-8,ESPOSITO>Someone put her in an altitude chamber.

189
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,000
<8-8,ESPOSITO>天呐
<8-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, my god.

190
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,450
<8-9,TED>谁会做出这种事啊
<8-9,TED>Who could've done something like that?

191
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,760
<8-10,RYAN>她是九点左右遇害的
<8-10,RYAN>She was killed at around 9:00 p.M.,

192
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,640
<8-10,RYAN>就在你离开后不久
<8-10,RYAN>not long after you arrived at the center.

193
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,990
<8-11,TED>不是我  不是我干的
<8-11,TED>Not me. It wasn't me.

194
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,780
<8-11,TED>你们怎么能认为我会做出这种事
<8-11,TED>How could you think I would do something like that?

195
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,950
<8-12,ESPOSITO>你有动机
<8-12,ESPOSITO>You had motive.

196
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,500
<8-12,ESPOSITO>你还有进出低压舱的权限
<8-12,ESPOSITO>You had access to the chamber.

197
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,890
<8-12,ESPOSITO>不然你为什么要去见她
<8-12,ESPOSITO>Why else would you even go and se e her?

198
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,390
<8-13,TED>我是去邀请她共进晚餐的
<8-13,TED>To ask her to dinner.

199
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,780
<8-14,RYAN>她跟你分了手  还害你被开除了  我猜...
<8-14,RYAN>After Marie dumped you and had you fired. I hope--

200
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,490
<8-15,TED>不是那样的  是我主动辞职的
<8-15,TED>It wasn't like that. I quit.

201
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,900
<8-15,TED>每天跟她抬头不见低头见  实在太痛苦了
<8-15,TED>It was too painful to be around her.

202
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,240
<8-15,TED>没想到周三的时候  她突然打给了我
<8-15,TED>Then on Wednesday, out of nowhere, she called me.

203
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,280
<8-15,TED>她想去喝咖啡
<8-15,TED>She wanted to go to coffee.

204
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,750
<8-16,ESPOSITO>为什么
<8-16,ESPOSITO>Now why would she do that?

205
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,170
<8-17,TED>我猜想  是为了跟我和解
<8-17,TED>To mend fences, I-I guess.

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,610
<8-17,TED>她还了我几件旧T恤
<8-17,TED>She gave me back some old T-shirts,

207
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,400
<8-17,TED>还有我的几张CD
<8-17,TED>some CDs she had of mine,

208
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,150
<8-17,TED>她说为我俩之前的分手方式感到抱歉
<8-17,TED>said she felt bad about the way things ended.

209
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,850
<8-17,TED>我以为我们也许还有机会
<8-17,TED>I thought maybe we still had a chance, you know?

210
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,890
<8-17,TED>所以我就去馆里找她了
<8-17,TED>So I went looking for her at the center.

211
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,090
<8-18,RYAN>-你找到她之后发生了什么  -没什么
<8-18,RYAN>- What happened when you found her?  - Nothing.

212
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,770
<8-19,TED>我们就聊了一小会
<8-19,TED>We talked for a few seconds.

213
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,070
<8-19,TED>她看起来有些沮丧
<8-19,TED>She seemed upset about something.

214
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,680
<8-19,TED>我试着想弄清原因
<8-19,TED>I-I tried to find out what,

215
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,680
<8-19,TED>可她正急着要去什么地方  所以我就走了
<8-19,TED>but she was in a hurry to get somewhere, so I left.

216
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,600
<8-19,TED>我回家了
<8-19,TED>I went home.

217
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
<8-19,TED>我八点就离开那里了
<8-19,TED>I-I was there by 8:00.

218
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,840
<8-20,ESPOSITO>把这儿当家吧
<8-20,ESPOSITO>Make yourself at home.

219
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,900
<8-20,ESPOSITO>你得在这儿待上一阵子了
<8-20,ESPOSITO>You're gonna be here for a while.

220
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,860
<9-1,BECKETT>鉴证组正在检查低压舱
<9-1,BECKETT>C.S.U. is going through the altitude chamber.

221
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,400
<9-1,BECKETT>只要他们能带回举证证据
<9-1,BECKETT>Once they get back with forensics,

222
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,590
<9-1,BECKETT>我们就能起诉泰德·卡特了
<9-1,BECKETT>we should be able to charge Ted Carter.

223
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,970
<9-2,CASTLE>跟我解释下
<9-2,CASTLE>Tell me this...

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,100
<9-2,CASTLE>卡特是怎么把尸体弄去铁路站场的
<9-2,CASTLE>How did Carter get the body to the rail yard?

225
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,400
<9-2,CASTLE>那个低压舱
<9-2,CASTLE>Well, the altitude chamber

226
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,190
<9-3,BECKETT>是紧挨着停车场的
<9-3,BECKETT>is right next to the parking garage,

227
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,470
<9-3,BECKETT>所以他可能先把尸体扔到了车上
<9-3,BECKETT>so he probably dumped her body in the car,

228
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,900
<9-3,BECKETT>然后开车送去了铁路站场
<9-3,BECKETT>took it out to the rail yard,

229
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,440
<9-3,BECKETT>试图让我们追踪不到
<9-3,BECKETT>and tried to throw us off the trail.

230
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,120
<9-4,CASTLE>知道怎么解释更合理吗
<9-4,CASTLE>You know what would be a better story?

231
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,580
<9-5,BECKETT>这起神秘事件只是地球人所为
<9-5,BECKETT>We have an earthbound solution to this mystery,

232
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,870
<9-5,BECKETT>你很失望  我明白
<9-5,BECKETT>and you are disappointed. I get it.

233
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,000
<9-5,BECKETT>可这个  不是吧
<9-5,BECKETT>But that, really?

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,670
<9-6,CASTLE>拜托  玛丽说她遇到了改变人生的大事
<9-6,CASTLE>Come on. Marie said she had a life-changing event.

235
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,470
<9-6,CASTLE>还有什么比碰上这家伙
<9-6,CASTLE>What could be more life changing

236
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,510
<9-6,CASTLE>更能改变人生呢
<9-6,CASTLE>than being beamed up by this guy?

237
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,280
<9-6,CASTLE>得了吧  卡塞尔
<9-6,CASTLE>Come on, Castle.

238
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,690
<9-7,BECKETT>咱们都清楚  根本没有外星人绑架这档子事
<9-7,BECKETT>We all know that there is no such thing as alien abductions.

239
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,570
<9-8,CASTLE>可是  大部分被绑架者都叙述了同样的经历
<9-8,CASTLE>And yet, most abductees report the same experiences--

240
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,330
<9-8,CASTLE>白光  记忆闪回之类的
<9-8,CASTLE>The white light, the memory flashes.

241
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,560
<9-9,BECKETT>那是因为他们都看了同一类书
<9-9,BECKETT>That's because they all read the same books,

242
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,600
<9-9,BECKETT>所以他们当然会描述出同样的事情
<9-9,BECKETT>so of course they describe the same event--

243
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
<9-9,BECKETT>黑暗的环境  荒凉的山路
<9-9,BECKETT>The dark, lonely road,

244
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,630
<9-9,BECKETT>凭空出现的刺眼白光
<9-9,BECKETT>the bright light out of nowhere,

245
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,380
<9-9,BECKETT>记忆芯片被来回戳啊刺啊的
<9-9,BECKETT>memories of being poked and prodded.

246
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,370
<9-10,CASTLE>我相信你想说的词是"植入芯片"
<9-10,CASTLE>I believe the word you're looking for is probed.

247
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,550
<9-10,CASTLE>当然  还有外星人的植入物
<9-10,CASTLE>And then of course there's the alien implant

248
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,500
<9-10,CASTLE>用来追踪被绑架者的
<9-10,CASTLE>that's used to track the abductees.

249
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,660
<9-11,BECKETT>让我想起了
<9-11,BECKETT>That reminds me of the lego

250
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
<9-11,BECKETT>六岁时卡在我鼻子里的积木
<9-11,BECKETT>I got stuck up my nose when I was 6.

251
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,620
<9-12,CASTLE>你咋了来着
<9-12,CASTLE>You what?

252
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,240
<9-13,ESPOSITO>伙计们
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Uh, guys.

253
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,840
<9-13,ESPOSITO>鉴证组检查过那个低压舱了
<9-13,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. finished going over the altitude chamber.

254
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,680
<9-13,ESPOSITO>-一无所获  -什么
<9-13,ESPOSITO>- Nothing turned up.  - What?

255
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,980
<9-14,BECKETT>那台机器明明就是
<9-14,BECKETT>I mean, that was the exact machine

256
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,270
<9-14,BECKETT>我们要找的东西啊
<9-14,BECKETT>that we were looking for,

257
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,710
<9-14,BECKETT>就在玛丽和她男友
<9-14,BECKETT>right in the building where

258
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,370
<9-14,BECKETT>工作的地方
<9-14,BECKETT>Marie and her ex-boyfriend work.

259
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,990
<9-14,BECKETT>那肯定就是凶器啊
<9-14,BECKETT>That had to have been the murder weapon.

260
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,660
<9-15,ESPOSITO>没有血迹  没有纤维组织  非常干净
<9-15,ESPOSITO>There's no blood, no tissue-- it's clean.

261
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,840
<9-16,BECKETT>无论如何也说不通啊
<9-16,BECKETT>That makes no sense whatsoever.

262
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,440
<9-17,BECKETT>再查查其他的低压舱
<9-17,BECKETT>Check other altitude chambers.

263
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,740
<9-18,ESPOSITO>那玩意又不是随处可见的
<9-18,ESPOSITO>It's not like they grow on trees.

264
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,720
<9-19,BECKETT>附近肯定不只那一个
<9-19,BECKETT>Well, that can't be the only one around.

265
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,620
<9-19,BECKETT>再找找其他
<9-19,BECKETT>And look for any other devices

266
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,410
<9-19,BECKETT>能造成这种伤害的仪器
<9-19,BECKETT>that cause the same injuries.

267
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,710
<9-20,ESPOSITO>我尽力吧
<9-20,ESPOSITO>I'll do my best.

268
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,380
<9-21,BECKETT>如果不是低压舱
<9-21,BECKETT>If it's not an altitude chamber,

269
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,830
<9-21,BECKETT>那会是什么呢
<9-21,BECKETT>then what could it be?

270
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,410
<9-22,BECKETT>反正不是那个
<9-22,BECKETT>Other than that.

272
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,700
<10-1,BECKETT>蕾妮  有什么发现
<10-1,BECKETT>Lanie, what'd you find?

273
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,380
<10-2,LANIE>没找到我想找的答案
<10-2,LANIE>Not the answers I was looking for.

274
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,230
<10-2,LANIE>反而发现了更多的疑问
<10-2,LANIE>Instead, just more questions.

275
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,800
<10-3,CASTLE>多么迷人的神秘气息啊
<10-3,CASTLE>How deliciously cryptic.

276
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,360
<10-4,LANIE>由于玛丽身上伤口的性状非常特殊
<10-4,LANIE>Because of the unique nature of Marie's injuries,

277
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,570
<10-4,LANIE>所以我想在进行解剖前
<10-4,LANIE>I wanted to thoroughly document her condition

278
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,440
<10-4,LANIE>先仔细检查下她的内部状况
<10-4,LANIE>before conducting the autopsy.

279
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,420
<10-4,LANIE>当我用X光扫描时
<10-4,LANIE>While I was taking the x-rays,

280
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,990
<10-4,LANIE>我发现这个东西嵌在她的鼻腔里
<10-4,LANIE>I saw this embedded in her sinus cavity.

281
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,630
<10-6,LANIE>-那是什么  -不知道
<10-6,LANIE>- What is that?  - I have no idea.

282
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,440
<10-7,CASTLE>说我疯了吧
<10-7,CASTLE>Call me crazy...

283
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,160
<10-7,CASTLE>这东西跟外星人植入物  一模一样
<10-7,CASTLE>That looks just like... An alien implant.

288
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,890
<11-1,CASTLE>把东西植入到那种地方
<11-1,CASTLE>What could you possibly be looking for

289
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,490
<11-1,CASTLE>关于外星人的传说中
<11-1,CASTLE>通常外星人会用探针探测人类的肛门...

290
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,490
<11-1,CASTLE>你们到底是想找啥啊
<11-1,CASTLE>by probing up there?

291
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,240
<11-2,ALEXIS>能商量下晚饭的事吗
<11-2,ALEXIS>Can we talk about dinner?

292
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,430
<11-2,ALEXIS>明白了
<11-2,ALEXIS>Oh, no.

293
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,400
<11-3,CASTLE>你没能说服奶奶别进厨房瞎搅和
<11-3,CASTLE>You couldn't convince gram to stay out of the kitchen.

294
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,500
<11-3,CASTLE>我会多准备点抗酸剂和呕吐袋的
<11-3,CASTLE>I will stock up on antacids and garbage bags.

295
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,080
<11-4,ALEXIS>不  不是这事  是阿什利的父母
<11-4,ALEXIS>No, it isn't that. It's Ashley's parents.

296
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,910
<11-5,CASTLE>他们怎么了
<11-5,CASTLE>What about 'em?

297
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,660
<11-6,ALEXIS>他爸爸是个经济学教授
<11-6,ALEXIS>He's an economics professor.

298
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,600
<11-6,ALEXIS>他们夫妻都是很严肃的人  老爸
<11-6,ALEXIS>The two of them are serious people, dad.

299
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,500
<11-6,ALEXIS>你  你可能得矜持点
<11-6,ALEXIS>Y-you may need to be more buttoned up.

300
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,980
<11-7,CASTLE>我可以矜持啊
<11-7,CASTLE>I can be buttoned up.

301
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,950
<11-7,CASTLE>我要是我不够矜持了
<11-7,CASTLE>And if I become unbuttoned,

302
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,060
<11-7,CASTLE>你可以狠狠踹我一脚
<11-7,CASTLE>You can discreetly let me know

303
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,020
<11-7,CASTLE>私下提醒我一下
<11-7,CASTLE>with a brutal kick to the shin.

304
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,440
<11-8,ALEXIS>我不会在场的
<11-8,ALEXIS>I won't be there.

305
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,130
<11-8,ALEXIS>他们觉得  只有你和奶奶去会更合适
<11-8,ALEXIS>They thought it would be better if it was just you and gram.

306
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,760
<11-9,CASTLE>-你要撇下我一个人  -你能行的
<11-9,CASTLE>- You're gonna leave me alone?  - You'll do great.

307
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,320
<11-10,ALEXIS>我只是想确保
<11-10,ALEXIS>I just wanted to make sure

308
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,510
<11-10,ALEXIS>你会给他们留下好印象
<11-10,ALEXIS>that you'll make a good impression.

309
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,340
<11-11,CASTLE>相信我  我也想啊
<11-11,CASTLE>Trust me... So do I.

310
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,370
<12-1,CASTLE>经济低迷时期  人们的超前消费行为
<12-1,CASTLE>Where do you come down on deficit spending

311
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,320
<12-1,CASTLE>-你觉得该由谁负责  -谢谢
<12-1,CASTLE>- during an economic downturn?  - Thank you.

312
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,130
<12-2,BECKETT>我接受大多数经济学家都支持的说法
<12-2,BECKETT>I take the theory that's held by most economists--

313
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,860
<12-2,BECKETT>超前消费是可以接受的
<12-2,BECKETT>That deficit spending is acceptable

314
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,270
<12-2,BECKETT>只要消费的对象是公共投资
<12-2,BECKETT>as long as it focuses on public investments,

315
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:25,980
<12-2,BECKETT>比如基础设施  国防建设  教育研究等
<12-2,BECKETT>like infrastructure, defense, education, research.

316
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,530
<12-3,CASTLE>哇塞  这么专业  哪学来的啊
<12-3,CASTLE>Wow. Where did that answer come from?

317
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,030
<12-4,BECKETT>纽约大学一学期的经济学理论课
<12-4,BECKETT>Semester of economic theory at N.Y.U.

318
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,340
<12-4,BECKETT>这问题又是从何而来
<12-4,BECKETT>Where did that question come from?

319
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,960
<12-5,CASTLE>我只是想打开话题
<12-5,CASTLE>I'm trying out conversation starters.

320
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,020
<12-6,BECKETT>好吧  话题打开了
<12-6,BECKETT>Well, we started a conversation,

321
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,390
<12-6,BECKETT>看来你成功了  算是吧
<12-6,BECKETT>So I guess it worked... Kind of.

322
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,980
<12-7,CASTLE>其实是跟阿什利的父母吃饭的事
<12-7,CASTLE>It's for a dinner with Ashley's parents.

323
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,180
<12-7,CASTLE>他是个古板的经济学家
<12-7,CASTLE>He's this stuffy economist, you know?

324
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,220
<12-7,CASTLE>我只是想赢得他们的好感
<12-7,CASTLE>And I just want to win 'em over,

325
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,870
<12-7,CASTLE>让他们站在我这边
<12-7,CASTLE>get them on my side.

326
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,160
<12-7,CASTLE>可万一他们不喜欢我咋办
<12-7,CASTLE>But what if they don't take to me?

327
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,670
<12-8,BECKETT>-拜托  卡塞尔  他们会喜欢你的  -真的吗
<12-8,BECKETT>- Oh, come on, Castle. They'll take to you.  - Really?

328
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,560
<12-11,CASTLE>-必须的  -谢了
<12-11,CASTLE>- Yeah.  - Thanks.

329
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,040
<12-12,BECKETT>-只要你装成另一个人就行了  -算你狠
<12-12,BECKETT>- So long as you don't act like yourself.  - Oh, nice one.

330
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,160
<12-14,CASTLE>话说  这个神秘的植入物  有啥进展
<12-14,CASTLE>So where do we stand on this mysterious implant?

331
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,510
<12-15,BECKETT>那不是植入物
<12-15,BECKETT>It is not an implant.

332
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,410
<12-15,BECKETT>蕾妮说那是个金属碎片
<12-15,BECKETT>Lanie says that it's a metal fragment,

333
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,350
<12-15,BECKETT>她现在正在检测
<12-15,BECKETT>and she's running tests on it right now.

334
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,880
<12-16,CASTLE>怎么跑她鼻子里去的
<12-16,CASTLE>How'd it get up her nose?

335
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,810
<12-17,BECKETT>可能是低压舱的碎片
<12-17,BECKETT>Well, maybe it was a piece of the altitude chamber

336
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,980
<12-17,BECKETT>弹了进去
<12-17,BECKETT>that got lodged up there.

337
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,620
<12-18,CASTLE>你是说我们没找到的那个低压舱
<12-18,CASTLE>The altitude chamber we haven't found?

338
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,480
<12-19,BECKETT>"还没"  我们暂时"还没"找到的那个低压舱
<12-19,BECKETT>Yet. The altitude chamber that we haven't found yet.

339
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,050
<12-19,BECKETT>我确定只要我们找到低压舱
<12-19,BECKETT>And I'm sure that as soon as we do,

340
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,580
<12-19,BECKETT>就会助我们找到凶手
<12-19,BECKETT>it will lead us straight to our killer.

341
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,820
<12-20,CASTLE>我注意到你说的是"凶手"而不是泰德·卡特
<12-20,CASTLE>I notice you said "Killer" and not Ted Carter.

342
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,100
<12-21,BECKETT>卡特的不在场证明证实了
<12-21,BECKETT>Yeah, Carter alibied out.

343
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,240
<12-21,BECKETT>他在玛丽被杀当晚订了外卖披萨
<12-21,BECKETT>He ordered pizza the night of Marie's murder

344
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,130
<12-21,BECKETT>在8点25分签了单
<12-21,BECKETT>and signed for it at 8:25.

345
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,860
<12-22,CASTLE>30分钟足够提供不在场证明了
<12-22,CASTLE>Alibis in 30 minutes or less.

346
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,280
<12-22,CASTLE>也就是说  目前为止  我们没有人类嫌疑人
<12-22,CASTLE>So at this point, we have no human suspects.

347
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,600
<12-23,BECKETT>从定义上来说  没有嫌疑人就是没有人类嫌疑人
<12-23,BECKETT>By definition, no suspect means "No human suspect."

348
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,470
<12-24,RYAN>貌似找到了一个嫌疑人
<12-24,RYAN>Well, one might be coming your way.

349
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,340
<12-24,RYAN>我检查了玛丽的单位电话记录
<12-24,RYAN>I checked Marie's phone logs at work.

350
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,070
<12-24,RYAN>发现在她周三离开科学中心之前
<12-24,RYAN>Turns out she made a 30-minute phone call

351
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,140
<12-24,RYAN>她打了一通30分钟的电话
<12-24,RYAN>before she left the science center on Wednesday.

352
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,730
<12-25,BECKETT>给谁
<12-25,BECKETT>To whom?

353
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,990
<12-26,RYAN>本尼·斯瑞克
<12-26,RYAN>Benny Stryker.

354
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,660
<12-27,CASTLE>那个大名鼎鼎的本尼·斯瑞克
<12-27,CASTLE>The Benny Stryker?

355
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
<12-27,CASTLE>著名的本尼·斯瑞克
<12-27,CASTLE>This Benny Stryker,

356
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,720
<12-27,CASTLE>《第四类劫持》的作者
<12-27,CASTLE>renowned author of "Taken By The Fourth Kind"?

357
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,820
<12-28,RYAN>就是他
<12-28,RYAN>One and the same.

358
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,410
<12-29,BECKETT>一位天体物理学家和一位不明飞行物研究家
<12-29,BECKETT>An astrophysicist and a ufologist,

359
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,140
<12-29,BECKETT>他俩应该水火不容啊
<12-29,BECKETT>isn't that like oil and water?

360
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,510
<12-30,RYAN>实际上  他们以前是同事
<12-30,RYAN>Actually, they used to be colleagues.

361
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,300
<12-30,RYAN>三年前
<12-30,RYAN>Three years ago,

362
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,620
<12-30,RYAN>他和玛丽是同一个研究团队的成员
<12-30,RYAN>he and Marie were members of the same research team,

363
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,840
<12-30,RYAN>但是玛丽担心他那些关于不明飞行物的言论
<12-30,RYAN>but Marie was worried that all his ufo talk

364
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,090
<12-30,RYAN>会毁掉团队的可信度
<12-30,RYAN>would destroy their credibility,

365
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,230
<12-30,RYAN>所以她把他从队伍里开除了
<12-30,RYAN>so she had him kicked off the team.

366
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,170
<12-30,RYAN>我听到的说法是  之后两人关系一直很紧张
<12-30,RYAN>From what I hear, there's been bad blood ever since.

367
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,780
<12-31,BECKETT>我们在哪能找到斯瑞克
<12-31,BECKETT>Where can we find Stryker?

368
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,730
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>被囚禁在一间冰冷的无菌室
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>Imprisoned in a cold white room...

369
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,290
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>怪异的脸庞盯着我们
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>Strange faces staring down at us...

370
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,890
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>这些影像会萦绕在我们脑海中
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>These are images that will haunt us.

371
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,970
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>但是它们也会使我们团结在一起  铭记这一切
<13-1,BENNY STRYKER>But they'll also unite us and help us remember,

372
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,750
<13-2,STRYKER>这不是我们的选择
<13-2,STRYKER>We didn't choose this.

373
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,330
<13-2,STRYKER>是他们选择了我们
<13-2,STRYKER>we were chosen.

374
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,500
<13-2,STRYKER>再说一遍
<13-2,STRYKER>One more time.

375
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,670
<13-2,STRYKER>这不是我们的选择  是他们选择了我们
<13-2,STRYKER>We didn't choose this. We were chosen.

376
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,330
<13-3,CASTLE>他就像是被外星人绑架过的托尼·罗宾斯
<13-3,CASTLE>He's like the Tony Robbins of alien abductions.

378
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,710
<13-4,STRYKER>看来我们有新成员了
<13-4,STRYKER>I see we have some new members.

379
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,220
<13-4,STRYKER>你们还是自我介绍一下  讲讲你们的经历吧
<13-4,STRYKER>Maybe you'd like to introduce yourself, tell us your story.

380
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,300
<13-5,STRYKER>哎呦喂
<13-5,STRYKER>Huh.

381
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,210
<13-5,STRYKER>你们真的认为
<13-5,STRYKER>Do you actually think

382
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,270
<14-1,STRYKER>玛丽的死和我有关吗
<14-1,STRYKER>I had something to do with Marie's death?

383
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,780
<14-2,BECKETT>斯瑞克先生  周四晚上9点你在哪
<14-2,BECKETT>Mr. Stryker, where were you on Thursday at 9:00 pm?

384
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,460
<14-3,STRYKER>在皇后区办新书签名会
<14-3,STRYKER>At a book signing in Queens.

385
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,780
<14-4,BECKETT>不过最近你和玛丽有过联络
<14-4,BECKETT>But you did have recent contact with Marie.

386
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,640
<14-4,BECKETT>事实上  她在周三给你打了电话
<14-4,BECKETT>In fact, she called you on Wednesday.

387
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,890
<14-4,BECKETT>谈了些什么事
<14-4,BECKETT>What was that about?

388
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,740
<14-5,STRYKER>我的确可以告诉你
<14-5,STRYKER>You know, I could tell you,

389
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,340
<14-5,STRYKER>但是我知道你不会相信的
<14-5,STRYKER>but I see, you wouldn't believe it.

390
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,380
<14-6,BECKETT>不管你说什么  我们都会客观的听取你的说辞
<14-6,BECKETT>Whatever you say will receive a fair hearing.

391
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,760
<14-7,STRYKER>我之前遇到过的情况可并非如此
<14-7,STRYKER>Well, that hasn't been my experience.

392
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,880
<14-7,STRYKER>上周在危难时刻玛丽给我打来电话
<14-7,STRYKER>Marie called me last week in crisis.

393
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,320
<14-7,STRYKER>她通过她的射电望远镜
<14-7,STRYKER>She had picked up anomalous submicrowave bursts

394
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,660
<14-7,STRYKER>发现了反常的亚微波爆炸
<14-7,STRYKER>on her radio telescope.

395
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,160
<14-7,STRYKER>那不仅仅是宇宙中的背景噪音
<14-7,STRYKER>It was not just the background noises of the universe.

396
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,370
<14-7,STRYKER>那是从附近传来
<14-7,STRYKER>It was a signal coming from somewhere nearby

397
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,300
<14-7,STRYKER>带有重复图样的信号
<14-7,STRYKER>with a repetitive pattern.

398
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,480
<14-8,CASTLE>是说联络信号吗
<14-8,CASTLE>As in... contact?

399
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,330
<14-9,STRYKER>至少她是这么认为的
<14-9,STRYKER>Or so she believed.

400
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,380
<14-9,STRYKER>她用射电望远镜阵列花更多的时间
<14-9,STRYKER>So she booked more time on her radio telescope array

401
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,540
<14-9,STRYKER>研究那部分天空的特殊情况
<14-9,STRYKER>and studied that section of the sky,

402
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,350
<14-9,STRYKER>这也就带来了麻烦
<14-9,STRYKER>Which is when the trouble started.

403
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,990
<14-10,BECKETT>什么麻烦
<14-10,BECKETT>What trouble?

404
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,810
<14-10,BECKETT>精神恍惚
<14-10,BECKETT>Lost time.

405
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,770
<14-11,STRYKER>周日有四个小时  她什么都不记得了
<14-11,STRYKER>Four hours on Sunday, just gone.

406
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,140
<14-11,STRYKER>之后她开始经历精神上的闪回
<14-11,STRYKER>Then she started having mental flashbacks--

407
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,570
<14-11,STRYKER>一间白色的屋子  一张模糊的脸质问她
<14-11,STRYKER>A white room, a blurry face questioning her.

408
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,380
<14-12,CASTLE>你是说  玛丽被外星人绑架了吗
<14-12,CASTLE>Are we saying, Marie was abducted by aliens?

409
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,010
<14-13,STRYKER>典型的迹象都出现了
<14-13,STRYKER>The classic indicators were there.

410
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,060
<14-13,STRYKER>我只是帮她把事情想明白
<14-13,STRYKER>I just tried to help her make sense of it.

411
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,260
<14-14,BECKETT>周三给你打过电话之后  玛丽离开了中心
<14-14,BECKETT>After Marie called you on Wednesday, she left the center.

412
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,460
<14-14,BECKETT>你知道她去哪了吗
<14-14,BECKETT>Do you know where she went?

413
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,080
<14-15,STRYKER>她说她要去找证据...
<14-15,STRYKER>She said she was gonna get proof of...

414
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,890
<14-15,STRYKER>她知道证据就在那
<14-15,STRYKER>What she knew was there.

415
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,730
<14-16,CASTLE>外星人的证据吗  她找到了吗
<14-16,CASTLE>Proof of aliens? And did she?

416
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,530
<14-17,STRYKER>之后没有再听到她的消息
<14-17,STRYKER>I never heard from her again.

417
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,470
<14-17,STRYKER>我以为他们
<14-17,STRYKER>I assumed they stopped her

418
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,860
<14-17,STRYKER>在她接近真相前阻止了她
<14-17,STRYKER>before she got too close to the truth.

419
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,420
<14-18,BECKETT>-谁  -政府
<14-18,BECKETT>- Who? - The government.

420
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,890
<14-19,STRYKER>我警告过她  她有可能被人跟踪了
<14-19,STRYKER>I warned her, she was probably being followed

421
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,840
<14-19,STRYKER>那些人不遗余力的...
<14-19,STRYKER>by men determined...

422
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,540
<14-19,STRYKER>试图将外星人存在这个事实保密
<14-19,STRYKER>to keep the existence of aliens a secret.

423
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,080
<14-20,CASTLE>听起来像是威尔·史密斯的电影
<14-20,CASTLE>It's like that Will Smith movie,

425
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,760
<14-20,CASTLE>不过没那么好笑
<14-20,CASTLE>only I'm guessing a lot less funny.

426
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,930
<14-21,STRYKER>这些特工真的存在  卡塞尔先生
<14-21,STRYKER>These agents are real, Mr. Castle.

427
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,180
<14-21,STRYKER>他们害怕如果我们在宇宙中并不孤独的消息
<14-21,STRYKER>They fear the revelation that we are not alone

428
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,440
<14-21,STRYKER>传出来会造成恐慌
<14-21,STRYKER>would be too shocking.

429
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,560
<14-21,STRYKER>群众会变得歇斯底里  国家会崩塌
<14-21,STRYKER>Hysteria would break out. Nations would crumble.

430
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,530
<14-21,STRYKER>正因为如此
<14-21,STRYKER>That's why

431
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,760
<14-21,STRYKER>他们才会试图让我这种信徒身败名裂
<14-21,STRYKER>they try to discredit believers like me

432
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,340
<14-21,STRYKER>减少有可能暴露事实真相的人
<14-21,STRYKER>and eliminate people who threaten to expose the truth--

433
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,020
<14-21,STRYKER>像玛丽这样的人
<14-21,STRYKER>People like Marie.

434
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,680
<15-1,BECKETT>书店确认那晚7点到9点
<15-1,BECKETT>The bookstore confirms that Stryker was signing his opus

435
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,980
<15-1,BECKETT>斯瑞克的确在签名售书
<15-1,BECKETT>between 7:00 and 10:00 pm.

436
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,010
<15-1,BECKETT>看来我们又回到了
<15-1,BECKETT>Looks like we're back to an

437
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,570
<15-1,BECKETT>没有嫌疑人的境地
<15-1,BECKETT>empty space in the suspect column.

438
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,200
<15-2,CASTLE>是啊  但是至少我们的时间线更合理了
<15-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but at least our timeline is making more sense.

439
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,150
<15-2,CASTLE>周日这个时间段  发生了所谓的"人生大事"
<15-2,CASTLE>This whole Sunday-ish area, the life-changing event,

440
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,580
<15-2,CASTLE>那就是她被绑架的时候
<15-2,CASTLE>That's when she was abducted.

441
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,990
<15-2,CASTLE>周三  她离开单位
<15-2,CASTLE>Wednesday, she leaves work,

442
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,010
<15-2,CASTLE>那是她去寻找外星人存在的证据
<15-2,CASTLE>that's when she was looking for proof of alien life.

443
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,690
<15-2,CASTLE>周四  她回来上班  情绪有所好转
<15-2,CASTLE>Thursday, she comes back to work, feeling better,

444
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,050
<15-2,CASTLE>直到她再次离开  最后...
<15-2,CASTLE>Until she leaves and winds up...

445
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,160
<15-2,CASTLE>爆发性压损致死
<15-2,CASTLE>Explosively decompressed.

446
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,160
<15-2,CASTLE>总的来说  很忙的一周
<15-2,CASTLE>Overall, a big week.

447
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,970
<15-3,BECKETT>你知道这时间线说明了什么吗
<15-3,BECKETT>You know what this timeline shows me?

448
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,650
<15-3,BECKETT>可能因服用毒品  或是身体疾病造成的
<15-3,BECKETT>A lot of erratic behavior that could be due to drug use

449
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,950
<15-3,BECKETT>一连串反常行为
<15-3,BECKETT>or any number of medical conditions.

450
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,260
<15-3,BECKETT>好吧
<15-3,BECKETT>All right.

451
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,820
<15-4,CASTLE>假设说玛丽
<15-4,CASTLE>Let's say Marie

452
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,420
<15-4,CASTLE>是一个有毒瘾的精神病患者  还得了脑瘤
<15-4,CASTLE>is a drug-addled psychotic with a brain tumor.

453
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,700
<15-4,CASTLE>她还是去寻找证据了啊
<15-4,CASTLE>She still went looking for proof.

454
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,470
<15-5,BECKETT>她去寻找她认为是证据的东西
<15-5,BECKETT>She went looking for what she thought was proof.

455
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,380
<15-6,CASTLE>不管怎样  万一她找到了呢
<15-6,CASTLE>Whatever it was, what if she found it?

456
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,170
<15-6,CASTLE>证据会在哪呢
<15-6,CASTLE>Where would it be?

457
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,520
<16-1,BECKETT>得了  卡塞尔  你不会真的相信
<16-1,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. You don't actually believe

458
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,780
<16-1,BECKETT>克林贡人是幕后主使吧
<16-1,BECKETT>that klingons are behind this, do you?

460
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,490
<16-2,CASTLE>即使以我的想象力  外星杀手也太扯了
<16-2,CASTLE>Killer aliens is a reach, even for me.

461
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,760
<16-2,CASTLE>但是政府特工为了掩盖真相痛下杀手
<16-2,CASTLE>But government agents covering up the truth?

462
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,140
<16-2,CASTLE>就不那么疯狂了
<16-2,CASTLE>Not so crazy.

463
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,030
<16-3,BECKETT>当然疯狂
<16-3,BECKETT>Yes, it is.

464
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,780
<16-3,BECKETT>我是说  到了最后
<16-3,BECKETT>I mean, when this is all said and done,

465
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,790
<16-3,BECKETT>最重要的还是要查出她被杀的地点和方式
<16-3,BECKETT>it will all come down to where and how she was killed.

466
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,540
<16-3,BECKETT>我打赌这一切
<16-3,BECKETT>And I bet it will have nothing to do

467
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,310
<16-3,BECKETT>都和秘密特工和巨大的政府阴谋无关
<16-3,BECKETT>with secret agents or massive government conspiracies.

468
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,640
<16-4,CASTLE>我跟你赌
<16-4,CASTLE>I'll take that bet.

469
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,230
<16-5,AYYANA>探长
<16-5,AYYANA>Detective.

470
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,130
<16-6,BECKETT>东西哪去了
<16-6,BECKETT>Where did everything go?

471
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,840
<16-7,AYYANA>早上两个男人带着联邦授权
<16-7,AYYANA>Two men came this morning with a-a federal warrant.

472
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,550
<16-7,AYYANA>他们把玛丽的东西装到了一辆卡车上
<16-7,AYYANA>They loaded all of Marie's stuff into a truck.

473
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,620
<16-8,BECKETT>他们是谁  哪个部门的
<16-8,BECKETT>Who were they? From which agency?

474
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,650
<16-9,AYYANA>他们只是说他们是有关部门
<16-9,AYYANA>They just said the government.

475
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,910
<16-10,CASTLE>赌债你要用小面额的给我
<16-10,CASTLE>I'd like my payment in small bills, please.

476
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,860
<17-1,MONTGOMERY>我在司法部门的联系人
<17-1,MONTGOMERY>My contact at justice

477
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,770
<17-1,MONTGOMERY>声称没有开据相关玛丽办公室的授权
<17-1,MONTGOMERY>says no warrant was issued for Marie's office.

478
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,430
<17-2,BECKETT>就是说自称是联邦探员的人
<17-2,BECKETT>Well, then people claiming to be federal agents

479
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,600
<17-2,BECKETT>拿走了她的东西
<17-2,BECKETT>seized her property.

480
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,520
<17-2,BECKETT>这到底是因为什么啊
<17-2,BECKETT>I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

481
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:40,920
<17-3,CASTLE>"黑衣人"[出自电影《黑衣人》]
<17-3,CASTLE>Men in black.

482
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,760
<17-4,BECKETT>-除了这个解释  -我已经四处打听了
<17-4,BECKETT>- Other than that. - I'll put out more feelers.

483
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,890
<17-5,MONTGOMERY>同时  你们随时向我汇报
<17-5,MONTGOMERY>Meantime, keep me posted.

484
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,970
<17-6,BECKETT>好的  感谢长官
<17-6,BECKETT>Okay, thank you.

485
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,320
<17-7,CASTLE>玛丽找到了证据  却被他们掩盖了
<17-7,CASTLE>Marie found proof, and they covered it up.

486
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,850
<17-7,CASTLE>正如本尼·斯瑞克所说
<17-7,CASTLE>It's just like Benny Stryker said.

487
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,910
<17-8,BECKETT>你真的想让我相信这个理论吗
<17-8,BECKETT>Do you honestly expect me to believe a theory--

488
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,240
<17-8,BECKETT>这个理论可是以"如本尼·斯瑞克所说"结尾的
<17-8,BECKETT>Any theory--that ends with "Like benny stryker said"?

489
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,290
<17-9,CASTLE>还能是谁  谁会拿走她的东西
<17-9,CASTLE>What else could it be? Who made off with all her stuff?

490
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,510
<17-10,BECKETT>也许玛丽参与了政府
<17-10,BECKETT>Maybe Marie was working on

491
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,010
<17-10,BECKETT>的一项秘密项目
<17-10,BECKETT>a classified government project,

492
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,250
<17-10,BECKETT>他们没收她的一切资料
<17-10,BECKETT>and they confiscated her data.

493
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,410
<17-11,CASTLE>她的资料在办公室家具里面吗
<17-11,CASTLE>Was her data in her furniture?

494
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,420
<17-11,CASTLE>别忘了家具也被拿走了
<17-11,CASTLE>Because they took that, too.

495
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,250
<17-12,BECKETT>不知道"他们"是谁
<17-12,BECKETT>Well, without knowing who "they" are,

496
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,960
<17-12,BECKETT>我们找不到他们的
<17-12,BECKETT>we can't find them.

497
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,910
<17-12,BECKETT>知道吗
<17-12,BECKETT>You know...

498
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,080
<17-12,BECKETT>关键在于杀人凶器
<17-12,BECKETT>the key lies in the murder weapon.

499
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
<17-12,BECKETT>埃斯波西托
<17-12,BECKETT>Esposito, tell me that you've

500
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,740
<17-12,BECKETT>找到那个低压舱了吗
<17-12,BECKETT>located that altitude chamber.

501
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,850
<17-12,BECKETT>找到了
<17-12,BECKETT>I did...

502
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,150
<17-13,ESPOSITO>在哈德逊大学的物理中心
<17-13,ESPOSITO>At the physics center at Hudson University.

503
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,110
<17-13,ESPOSITO>那是五个区内唯一的一个
<17-13,ESPOSITO>It was the only other one in the five boroughs.

504
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,150
<17-14,BECKETT>看见没
<17-14,BECKETT>See?

505
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,290
<17-15,ESPOSITO>那不是凶器
<17-15,ESPOSITO>It's clean.

506
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,440
<17-15,ESPOSITO>鉴证组刚检查过了
<17-15,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. just checked.

507
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,390
<17-16,BECKETT>那么肯定有另一台机器
<17-16,BECKETT>Well, there's gotta be another device

508
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,450
<17-16,BECKETT>能做到同样的事
<17-16,BECKETT>that does the same thing.

509
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,810
<17-17,ESPOSITO>蕾妮和我查过了
<17-17,ESPOSITO>Lanie and I looked into that.

510
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,340
<17-17,ESPOSITO>我们唯一找到的就是工业真空包装机
<17-17,ESPOSITO>The only thing we found was an industrial vacuum packer.

511
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,860
<17-17,ESPOSITO>是用来处理食物的
<17-17,ESPOSITO>It's used for food processing.

512
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,110
<17-18,BECKETT>将市里的每一台都检查一遍
<17-18,BECKETT>Check into every single one in town.

513
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,910
<17-18,BECKETT>我们必须找出犯罪现场
<17-18,BECKETT>We need to locate that crime scene.

514
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,590
<17-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<17-18,BECKETT>Castle.

515
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,740
<17-19,ESPOSITO>证明是外星人干的  兄弟  拜托了
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Just prove that E.T. did this, bro, please.

516
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,690
<17-19,ESPOSITO>我是捉人的  不是找机器的
<17-19,ESPOSITO>I hunt people, not machines.

517
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,010
<17-20,CASTLE>-我会努力的  -谢谢
<17-20,CASTLE>- I'm working on it. - Thank you.

518
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,570
<18-1,CASTLE>或许我们应该将注意力
<18-1,CASTLE>Maybe we should focus

519
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,920
<18-1,CASTLE>集中在玛丽星期三的神秘行动
<18-1,CASTLE>on Marie's mystery Wednesday trip.

520
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,810
<18-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  证明外星人的存在
<18-2,BECKETT>Castle, finding proof of aliens

521
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,910
<18-2,BECKETT>不会帮我们逮捕凶手的
<18-2,BECKETT>will not help us catch our killer.

522
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,930
<18-3,CASTLE>会有帮助的  特别是当她去了
<18-3,CASTLE>It will if she went somewhere

523
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,870
<18-3,CASTLE>有工业真空包装机的地方
<18-3,CASTLE>with an industrial vacuum packer.

524
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,930
<18-4,RYAN>如果是的话  那不在泽西收费公路旁边
<18-4,RYAN>If she did, it was off the jersey turnpike.

525
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,980
<18-4,RYAN>她的易通账户显示她从九号出口下公路了
<18-4,RYAN>Her e-zpass account shows her getting off at exit 9.

526
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,460
<18-5,BECKETT>-她去哪里了  -这很难说
<18-5,BECKETT>- Where'd she go from there? - Hard to say.

527
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,070
<18-6,RYAN>我查过了她的信用卡  在该区域没有记录
<18-6,RYAN>I checked her credit cards. No activity in the area.

528
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,960
<18-7,BECKETT>你在干什么
<18-7,BECKETT>What are you doing?

529
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,220
<18-8,CASTLE>我在找地图
<18-8,CASTLE>I am mapping it.

530
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,940
<18-8,CASTLE>新泽西收费公路九号出口

538
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,730
<19-1,JOY HARRISON>没错  玛丽星期三有来过
<19-1,JOY HARRISON>Yeah, Marie was here on Wednesday.

539
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,840
<19-2,BECKETT>但她有自己望远镜的使用权限
<19-2,BECKETT>But she had access to her own telescope.

540
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,910
<19-2,BECKETT>她为什么要用这个
<19-2,BECKETT>Why would she need this one?

541
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,670
<19-3,JOY>玛丽平时是用射电望远镜
<19-3,JOY>Marie usually worked with a radio telescope.

542
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,380
<19-3,JOY>这是光学望远镜
<19-3,JOY>This is an optical telescope.

543
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,900
<19-4,CASTLE>那么她是来看
<19-4,CASTLE>So she came here to get a visual

544
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,670
<19-4,CASTLE>外太空的影像的
<19-4,CASTLE>on something up there in space?

545
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,060
<19-5,JOY>她说她接收到异常的信号
<19-5,JOY>She said she picked up signal anomalies.

546
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,680
<19-5,JOY>她想看看信号是从哪里来的
<19-5,JOY>She wanted to see where they were coming from.

547
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,530
<19-5,JOY>她做了图像采集  然后就走了
<19-5,JOY>She took an image capture, then she left.

548
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,030
<19-6,BECKETT>我们可以拿到图像的复制本吗
<19-6,BECKETT>Could we get a copy of that image?

549
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,640
<19-7,JOY>我查过了望远镜的硬盘驱动器
<19-7,JOY>I checked the telescope's hard drive.

550
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,490
<20-1,BECKETT>她消除了所有东西
<20-1,BECKETT>She erased everything.

551
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,510
<19-7,JOY>坐标  图像采集  全都没有了
<19-7,JOY>Coordinates, the image capture, it's all gone.

552
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,590
<20-1,BECKETT>她消除了所有东西
<20-1,BECKETT>She erased everything.

553
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,550
<20-1,BECKETT>她到底看见了什么
<20-1,BECKETT>What the hell did she see up there?

554
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,650
<20-2,CASTLE>玛丽·苏巴拉奥  一个清醒的科学家
<20-2,CASTLE>Marie Subbarao, a sober-minded scientist

555
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,880
<20-2,CASTLE>相信自己在截取了奇怪的
<20-2,CASTLE>believes she was abducted by aliens

556
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,030
<20-2,CASTLE>无线电信号之后被外星人绑架了
<20-2,CASTLE>after intercepting strange radio signals.

557
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,120
<20-2,CASTLE>她利用望远镜
<20-2,CASTLE>Using a telescope,

558
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,500
<20-2,CASTLE>拍下了讯息的来源
<20-2,CASTLE>she photographs the source of the signal.

559
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,350
<20-2,CASTLE>第二天  神秘地死亡了
<20-2,CASTLE>The next day, dies mysteriously.

560
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,330
<20-2,CASTLE>然后她的办公室被可疑政府特工侵入
<20-2,CASTLE>Then her office is raided by shadowy government agents.

561
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,460
<20-2,CASTLE>我没叫你去染红发
<20-2,CASTLE>I'm not asking you to dye your hair red

563
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,610
<20-2,CASTLE>然后管我叫穆德
<20-2,CASTLE>and call me Mulder.

564
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,660
<20-2,CASTLE>我只是让你考虑一下有可能
<20-2,CASTLE>I would simply ask that you consider the possibility

565
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,130
<20-2,CASTLE>玛丽知道了或者
<20-2,CASTLE>that Marie had knowledge of

566
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,480
<20-2,CASTLE>联络了上面的某些东西
<20-2,CASTLE>or made contact with something up there.

567
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,050
<20-2,CASTLE>这才害死了她
<20-2,CASTLE>That somehow led to her death.

568
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,070
<20-3,BECKETT>我们会继续展开调查
<20-3,BECKETT>We will continue our investigation

569
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,850
<20-3,BECKETT>然后破解这案子
<20-3,BECKETT>and solve this case,

570
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,830
<20-3,BECKETT>破案跟小绿人完全没有任何关系
<20-3,BECKETT>and it will have nothing to do with little green men.

571
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,910
<20-4,CASTLE>他们是灰色的
<20-4,CASTLE>They're gray, actually.

<20-10,CASTLE>我的手表也不走了
<20-10,CASTLE>Neither is my watch.

578

<20-10,CASTLE>你对这有合理解释的  对吧
<20-10,CASTLE>You have a logical explanation for this, too, right?

579

<30-3,ESPOSITO>被政府特工绑架了吗  说吧
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Hmm. Abducted by government agents, huh? Come on.

640
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,070
<30-3,ESPOSITO>你们俩到底做什么了
<30-3,ESPOSITO>What were you two really doing?

641
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,830
<30-4,BECKETT>这不是吻痕  埃斯波西托
<30-4,BECKETT>It's not a hickey, Esposito.

642
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,550
<30-5,ESPOSITO>你们俩都有一个
<30-5,ESPOSITO>You both have one.

643
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,680
<30-6,CASTLE>我倒希望是吻痕  这是注射器的痕迹
<30-6,CASTLE>I wish it was a hickey. It's from the injectors.

644
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,990
<30-8,ESPOSITO>现在的年轻人都是这样形容的吗
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Is that what the kids are calling it these days?

645
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,020
<30-9,CASTLE>他们是黑衣人
<30-9,CASTLE>They were men in black.

646
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,710
<30-10,BECKETT>真空包装机调查得怎么样了
<30-10,BECKETT>Where are you with the vacuum packers?

647
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,460
<30-11,ESPOSITO>目前为止我在五区内共找到了
<30-11,ESPOSITO>So far, I have found over a hundred machines

648
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,010
<30-11,ESPOSITO>上百台机器
<30-11,ESPOSITO>in the five boroughs.

649
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,620
<30-11,ESPOSITO>鉴证组正尽快检查了
<30-11,ESPOSITO>C.S.U.'s checking 'em as fast as they can.

650
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,690
<30-12,CASTLE>那香烟呢
<30-12,CASTLE>And the cigarettes?

651
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,600
<30-13,ESPOSITO>没有吻合的DNA  但那是中国牌子
<30-13,ESPOSITO>No DNA match, but they are a chinese brand

652
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,300
<30-13,ESPOSITO>只有在亚洲或唐人街的黑市能找到
<30-13,ESPOSITO>only found in asia or on the black market in chinatown.

653
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,000
<30-14,CASTLE>那么她有可能被外星人杀了
<30-14,CASTLE>So maybe she was killed by an alien,

654
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,170
<30-14,CASTLE>非法居留的外来人
<30-14,CASTLE>just an illegal alien.

655
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,420
<30-15,RYAN>-那是吻痕吗  -是的
<30-15,RYAN>- Those hickeys? - Yes.

656
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,720
<30-18,CASTLE>-不是  -我倒希望是
<30-18,CASTLE>- No. - I wish.

657
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,820
<30-19,RYAN>好吧  技术人员全面检查了你的车
<30-19,RYAN>Okay. So tech just went through your vehicle.

658
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,420
<30-19,RYAN>结果发现你们是被EMP击中了
<30-19,RYAN>Turns out you were hit with an E.M.P.

659
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,900
<30-19,RYAN>一种电磁脉冲
<30-19,RYAN>An electromagnetic pulse

660
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,130
<30-19,RYAN>能破坏所有电子设备
<30-19,RYAN>which knocked out all the electronics.

661
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,520
<30-19,RYAN>还有这是为什么他们能找到你
<30-19,RYAN>And here's how they found you in the first place.

662
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,020
<30-20,BECKETT>追踪器  窃听器
<30-20,BECKETT>Tracers, listening devices.

663
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,870
<30-20,BECKETT>他们肯定在监视科技馆
<30-20,BECKETT>They must have been watching the science center.

664
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,730
<30-20,BECKETT>就是在那时侯将这些放进了我的车子
<30-20,BECKETT>That's when they put these accessories in my car.

665
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,290
<30-21,CASTLE>或许那就是玛丽鼻子里面的东西
<30-21,CASTLE>Maybe that's what was up Marie's nose.

666
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,930
<30-21,CASTLE>或许他们也在跟踪她
<30-21,CASTLE>Perhaps they were tracking her,too.

667
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,740
<30-22,ESPOSITO>不  那不是追踪器或者植入物
<30-22,ESPOSITO>No, it wasn't a tracer or an implant.

668
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,500
<30-22,ESPOSITO>蕾妮鉴定出了这是曲霉菌
<30-22,ESPOSITO>Lanie identified it as aspergillus.

669
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,060
<30-22,ESPOSITO>这是鼻窦感染的引起的少量钙化
<30-22,ESPOSITO>It's a rare calcification resulting from a sinus infection.

670
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,090
<30-22,ESPOSITO>钙化过于密集  令它看起来像是金属
<30-22,ESPOSITO>The calcification is so dense, it reads like metal.

671
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,540
<30-23,BECKETT>看见没  合理的解释
<30-23,BECKETT>There you go. Logical explanation.

672
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,680
<30-24,CASTLE>是啊  也我会把追踪器伪装成成罕见...
<30-24,CASTLE>Yeah. I would disguise my tracking implants as a rare medical...

673
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,580
<30-25,BECKETT>重要的是  这帮家伙
<30-25,BECKETT>You know, the bottom line is that these guys

674
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,470
<30-25,BECKETT>急切想找回玛丽拿到的东西
<30-25,BECKETT>were desperate to get whatever Marie took,

675
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,930
<30-25,BECKETT>所以我们得抢先一步
<30-25,BECKETT>so we gotta find it first,

676
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,900
<30-25,BECKETT>因为这是找到凶手的关键
<30-25,BECKETT>because that'll lead us to the killer.

677
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,060
<30-26,ESPOSITO>没错  但我们不知道究竟要找什么
<30-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but we really don't know what we're looking for.

678
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,980
<30-27,BECKETT>可我们知道不在他们手上
<30-27,BECKETT>But we do know that they don't have it.

679
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,750
<30-28,CASTLE>也就是说不在玛丽的办公室里
<30-28,CASTLE>Which means it wasn't in Marie's office.

680
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,400
<30-29,RYAN>她也许给藏起来了
<30-29,RYAN>She maybe hid it somewhere.

681
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,730
<30-30,ESPOSITO>也许藏在她信任
<30-30,ESPOSITO>Maybe with someone she trusted,

682
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,610
<30-30,ESPOSITO>比较不容易被人发现的人那里
<30-30,ESPOSITO>somebody under the radar.

683
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,700
<30-31,BECKETT>泰德·卡特说玛丽上周三晚上
<30-31,BECKETT>Ted Carter said that Marie gave him

684
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,200
<30-31,BECKETT>把他的东西还回去了
<30-31,BECKETT>some of his stuff back last Wednesday night.

685
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,990
<30-32,CASTLE>也许还得不仅仅是他的东西
<30-32,CASTLE>Maybe that's not all she gave him.

686
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,280
<31-1,TED>我不明白
<31-1,TED>I don't understand.

687
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,330
<31-1,TED>大部分都是书和T恤衫
<31-1,TED>It's just books and t-shirts mostly.

688
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,740
<31-2,BECKETT>卡特先生 你有留意到
<31-2,BECKETT>Mr. Carter, did you notice anything different

689
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,810
<31-2,BECKETT>她给你的东西有异样吗
<31-2,BECKETT>in the things that she gave you,

690
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,540
<31-2,BECKETT>原先没有的东西
<31-2,BECKETT>anything that wasn't there before?

691
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,300
<31-3,TED>没有  都是我的东西
<31-3,TED>No, it's all my stuff.

692
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,580
<31-3,TED>只是T恤衫  杰弗逊星船合唱团的CD
<31-3,TED>It's just t-shirts, Jefferson Starship cd--

693
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,720
<31-4,CASTLE>这张CD帮我度过了
<31-4,CASTLE>Oh! This cd got me through two weeks

694
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,360
<31-4,CASTLE>两个星期的《斯道姆观望》创作瓶颈期
<31-4,CASTLE>of "Storm Watch" Writer's block.

695
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,310
<31-5,CASTLE>我不记得是2张CD的
<31-5,CASTLE>I don't remember it being a 2-disc set.

696
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,600
<31-6,BECKETT>这张没有标识
<31-6,BECKETT>This one's unmarked.

697
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,310
<31-7,CASTLE>也许是玛丽的证据
<31-7,CASTLE>Marie's proof perhaps?

698
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,340
<31-7,CASTLE>不  等等
<31-7,CASTLE>Oh, oh, oh, no, wait.

699
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,150
<31-7,CASTLE>就这样吗
<31-7,CASTLE>That's it?

700
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,370
<32-1,CASTLE>毫无盛大壮观之势
<32-1,CASTLE>I mean, no pomp, no circumstance?

701
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,390
<32-1,CASTLE>这里面的内容有可能
<32-1,CASTLE>What's on this could shake

702
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,410
<32-1,CASTLE>撼动人类存在的基石
<32-1,CASTLE>the very foundations of our existence.

703
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,300
<32-1,CASTLE>我们需要停留  品味
<32-1,CASTLE>We need to pause and savor--

704
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,880
<32-2,BECKETT>别闹了  直接放进去看看吧
<32-2,BECKETT>Please. Let's just stick it in and get this over with.

705
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,580
<32-3,BECKETT>我是说  事实是
<32-3,BECKETT>I mean, the fact of the matter is,

706
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,380
<32-3,BECKETT>这张CD也许对我们的调查
<32-3,BECKETT>there's probably nothing of any value on that cd...

707
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,310
<32-3,BECKETT>毫无帮...
<32-3,BECKETT>to our investigati--

708
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,280
<32-4,CASTLE>你说什么来着
<32-4,CASTLE>You were saying?

709
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,560
<32-5,BECKETT>不可能
<32-5,BECKETT>No way.

710
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,290
<33-1,CASTLE>仔细看这个图片  女士和先生们
<33-1,CASTLE>Behold this image, gentlemen and lady.

711
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,960
<33-1,CASTLE>我们见证了一场惊天大事
<33-1,CASTLE>We are witness to a stunning event--

712
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,250
<33-1,CASTLE>人类历史的转折点
<33-1,CASTLE>A turning point in human history--

713
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,690
<33-1,CASTLE>此刻我们知道  我们并不孤单
<33-1,CASTLE>The moment we knew... We were not alone.

714
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,890
<33-1,CASTLE>因为谁能否认这个是...
<33-1,CASTLE>For who can deny that this...

715
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,890
<33-1,CASTLE>外星人宇宙飞船呢
<33-1,CASTLE>is an alien spacecraft.

716
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,220
<33-2,RYAN>看起来是挺像的
<33-2,RYAN>It does kinda look like one.

717
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,790
<33-3,ESPOSITO>是的  但这个图像
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but this image?

718
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,800
<33-3,ESPOSITO>这肯定修过的  对吧  贝克特
<33-3,ESPOSITO>I mean, it's gotta be doctored. Right, Beckett?

719
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,750
<33-4,BECKETT>我不知道
<33-4,BECKETT>I don't know.

720
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,360
<33-5,ESPOSITO>你在说什么
<33-5,ESPOSITO>What are you saying?

721
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,000
<33-6,RYAN>你是说  你觉得这是真的
<33-6,RYAN>Are you saying, you think that this is real?

722
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,840
<33-7,BECKETT>这个
<33-7,BECKETT>Well...

723
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,790
<33-7,BECKETT>这看起来不像修过的
<33-7,BECKETT>It doesn't look doctored.

724
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,740
<33-8,CASTLE>搞清各位的态度  以便确认各位都说了什么
<33-8,CASTLE>Okay, just for clarity, so we know later who said what,

725
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,500
<33-8,CASTLE>你承认有可能
<33-8,CASTLE>You are conceding that it is a possibility

726
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,020
<33-8,CASTLE>这是一艘外星人宇宙飞船
<33-8,CASTLE>that this is an alien spaceship?

727
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,270
<33-9,BECKETT>我说的是
<33-9,BECKETT>What I am saying

728
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,760
<33-9,BECKETT>我们现在知道了那些特工要找的东西
<33-9,BECKETT>is that we now know what these agents were after.

729
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,770
<33-10,CASTLE>就差一点
<33-10,CASTLE>That close.

730
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,130
<33-11,BECKETT>在我看来
<33-11,BECKETT>And as far as I'm concerned,

731
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,740
<33-11,BECKETT>让更高层人员去处理吧
<33-11,BECKETT>let a higher pay grade deal with it.

732
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,150
<33-11,BECKETT>我们现在有筹码和神秘特工谈判
<33-11,BECKETT>We now have leverage that we can use with our mystery agents.

733
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,470
<33-12,RYAN>怎么做  我们又不能直接打给他们
<33-12,RYAN>How? It's not like we can just call 'em up? Mm.

734
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,970
<33-13,CASTLE>我们有一盒窃听器
<33-13,CASTLE>W--uh, we do have a box of bugs.

735
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,700
<33-13,CASTLE>除了蝙蝠侠的电话就这个最赞了
<33-13,CASTLE>It's the next best thing to a batphone.

736
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,120
<33-14,BECKETT>我们有你要的东西  你知道我们的位置
<33-14,BECKETT>We have what you want. You know where we are.

737
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,760
<33-15,ESPOSITO>你真觉得这能成功吗
<33-15,ESPOSITO>You really think that's gonna work?

738
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,560
<34-1,BECKETT>请坐
<34-1,BECKETT>Please take a seat.

739
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,310
<34-2,WESTFIELD>东西在哪里
<34-2,WESTFIELD>So where is it?

740
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,380
<34-3,BECKETT>休想
<34-3,BECKETT>Not a chance.

741
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,330
<34-3,BECKETT>我想以此做个交换
<34-3,BECKETT>I want something in return--

742
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,330
<34-3,BECKETT>杀害玛丽·苏巴拉奥的凶手的名字
<34-3,BECKETT>The name of Marie Subbarao's killer.

743
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,330
<34-4,WESTFIELD>女士优先
<34-4,WESTFIELD>Ladies first.

744
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,100
<34-5,WESTFIELD>你为何给我看这个
<34-5,WESTFIELD>Why are you showing me this?

745
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,820
<34-6,CASTLE>这是玛丽在天文台拍下的
<34-6,CASTLE>It's the photo that Marie took from the observatory

746
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,510
<34-6,CASTLE>外星人飞船
<34-6,CASTLE>of the alien ship.

747
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,420
<34-7,WESTFIELD>我得告辞了
<34-7,WESTFIELD>I'll be on my way now.

748
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,250
<34-8,BECKETT>等等  我们说好的
<34-8,BECKETT>Wait a minute. We had a deal.

749
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,250
<34-9,WESTFIELD>你说你有我要的东西  但是你没有
<34-9,WESTFIELD>You said you had what I want. As it happens, you don't.

750
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,560
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>你不能走  玛丽·苏巴拉奥
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>You're not leaving. Marie Subbarao was murdered

751
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,550
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>被极其凶残的手法杀害
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>in the most awful way imaginable,

752
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,330
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>而凶手依然逍遥法外
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>and her killer is still out there.

753
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,360
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>你欠她的  告诉我们凶手的名字
<34-10,MONTGOMERY>You owe it to her. Give us that name.

754
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,110
<34-11,WESTFIELD>也许她并不是你们认为的那样
<34-11,WESTFIELD>Maybe she isn't who you think she is.

755
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,700
<34-11,WESTFIELD>你这是什么意思
<34-11,WESTFIELD>What's that supposed to mean?

756
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,810
<34-12,BECKETT>如果不是这样  那又是什么
<34-12,BECKETT>I mean, if it's not this, then what?

757
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,040
<34-12,BECKETT>为什么要纠缠一位天体物理学家
<34-12,BECKETT>Why all of this fuss over an astrophysicist

758
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,420
<34-12,BECKETT>她只是分析无线电信号
<34-12,BECKETT>who analyzes radio signals?

759
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,670
<34-13,CASTLE>除非她分析的是秘密
<34-13,CASTLE>Unless what she analyzed was secret.

760
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,920
<34-13,CASTLE>就是这么回事  对吧
<34-13,CASTLE>That's it, isn't it?

761
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,930
<34-13,CASTLE>她拦截了机密信息
<34-13,CASTLE>She intercepted classified information.

762
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,000
<34-14,BECKETT>你说过她拿走一些
<34-14,BECKETT>Yeah, you did say that she took something

763
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,740
<34-14,BECKETT>涉及国家安全的重要东西
<34-14,BECKETT>that was vital to our security.

764
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,690
<34-14,BECKETT>我们在案发现场发现中国香烟
<34-14,BECKETT>And we found Chinese cigarettes at the crime scene.

765
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,710
<34-14,BECKETT>她给中国人工作吗
<34-14,BECKETT>Was she working with the Chinese?

766
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,930
<34-15,CASTLE>你要么现在告诉我们真相
<34-15,CASTLE>Look, either you tell us the truth now,

767
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,140
<34-15,CASTLE>要么我们把情况交给媒体
<34-15,CASTLE>Or we take what we know to the media.

768
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,820
<34-16,WESTFIELD>你觉得他们会发表吗
<34-16,WESTFIELD>What makes you think they'll print it?

769
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,740
<34-17,CASTLE>他们也许不会
<34-17,CASTLE>Oh, they probably won't.

770
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,620
<34-17,CASTLE>但我知道很多博主愿意发表
<34-17,CASTLE>But I know more than a dozen bloggers who will.

771
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,060
<34-17,CASTLE>更别提我那50多万
<34-17,CASTLE>Not to mention over half a million

772
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,080
<34-17,CASTLE>微博上的书迷
<34-17,CASTLE>of my own followers on Twitter.

773
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,900
<34-18,WESTFIELD>我说的绝对不能泄露出去
<34-18,WESTFIELD>Nothing I say can leave this room.

774
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,540
<34-19,MONTGOMERY>我们向你保证
<34-19,MONTGOMERY>You have our word on that.

775
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,570
<34-20,WESTFIELD>上个月  我们确定一个敌国间谍
<34-20,WESTFIELD>Last month, we determined that an enemy operative

776
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,640
<34-20,WESTFIELD>拦截了太平洋舰队与国防部之间的
<34-20,WESTFIELD>Had intercepted classified, coded data streams

777
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,840
<34-20,WESTFIELD>绝密数据流
<34-20,WESTFIELD>between the pacific fleet and the pentagon.

778
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,510
<34-21,BECKETT>你认为是玛丽干的
<34-21,BECKETT>You think it was Marie.

779
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,700
<34-22,WESTFIELD>拦截传送的时间与
<34-22,WESTFIELD>The intercepted transmissions coincided

780
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,550
<34-22,WESTFIELD>玛丽将她的无线电天文望远镜
<34-22,WESTFIELD>with Marie's tasking her radio telescope

781
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,450
<34-22,WESTFIELD>对准我们的卫星的时间一致
<34-22,WESTFIELD>to point at our satellite,

782
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,290
<34-22,WESTFIELD>这根本不是
<34-22,WESTFIELD>which was nowhere near where she was

783
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,400
<34-22,WESTFIELD>她原本应该研究的对象
<34-22,WESTFIELD>supposed to be doing her research.

784
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,790
<34-23,CASTLE>那这不是飞碟的照片
<34-23,CASTLE>So that wasn't a photo of a UFO.

785
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,460
<34-23,CASTLE>而是你们的间谍卫星
<34-23,CASTLE>That was your spy satellite.

786
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,250
<34-24,WESTFIELD>但真正的破坏是她下载的数据
<34-24,WESTFIELD>But the real damage done is the data she downloaded,

787
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,630
<34-24,WESTFIELD>我担心现在在中国人手上
<34-24,WESTFIELD>which I fear is now in the hands of the Chinese.

788
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,710
<34-25,BECKETT>那是谁杀了她
<34-25,BECKETT>So then who killed her?

789
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,860
<34-26,WESTFIELD>我认为是她的中间人
<34-26,WESTFIELD>Her handler, I imagine.

790
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,390
<34-26,WESTFIELD>这个中国人肯定知道我们在调查他们
<34-26,WESTFIELD>The Chinese must have known we were on to them.

791
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,430
<34-26,WESTFIELD>他们很聪明
<34-26,WESTFIELD>They were smart enough

792
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,690
<34-26,WESTFIELD>把这事弄成像是她男友干的
<34-26,WESTFIELD>to make it look like the boyfriend did it.

793
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,500
<34-27,MONTGOMERY>谁是中间人
<34-27,MONTGOMERY>Who's this handler?

794
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,360
<34-28,WESTFIELD>中国情报人员
<34-28,WESTFIELD>Someone from Chinese intelligence.

795
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,760
<34-28,WESTFIELD>我们无法核实他的身份
<34-28,WESTFIELD>We were never able to identify him.

796
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,460
<34-28,WESTFIELD>不管他是谁  你们永远抓不到他
<34-28,WESTFIELD>Whoever he is, you'll never catch him.

797
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,780
<34-28,WESTFIELD>结束了
<34-28,WESTFIELD>It's over.

798
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,070
<34-28,WESTFIELD>这从来没有结束
<34-28,WESTFIELD>It's never over.

799
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,950
<35-1,BOB LINDEN>在书中  我以一种新颖大胆的看法
<35-1,BOB LINDEN>In the book, I take a bold new look

800
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,320
<35-1,BOB LINDEN>审视市场线性集合
<35-1,BOB LINDEN>at the linear aggregation of markets.

801
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,040
<35-2,CASTLE>早就该这样了
<35-2,CASTLE>It's about time someone did.

802
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,840
<35-3,BOB>阿什利告诉我你也是作家
<35-3,BOB>So Ashley tells me you're an author as well.

803
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,060
<35-3,BOB>卡塞尔先生  说说你的书吧
<35-3,BOB>Tell me about your writing, Mr. Castle.

804
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,740
<35-3,BOB>我不看畅销小说
<35-3,BOB>I don't read popular fiction.

805
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,450
<35-3,BOB>我发现大部分都愚蠢且华而不实
<35-3,BOB>I find most of it crass and tawdry.

806
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,900
<35-3,BOB>是的  没错
<35-3,BOB>Yes. Right.

807
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,710
<35-4,CASTLE>嗯  我
<35-4,CASTLE>Well, I, uh...

808
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,780
<35-4,CASTLE>我觉得我的写作
<35-4,CASTLE>I think of my writing

809
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,120
<35-4,CASTLE>像是通过人类行为来进行性格研究
<35-4,CASTLE>as character studies in human behavior,

810
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,800
<35-4,CASTLE>寻求人类行为的真正动因
<35-4,CASTLE>looking into the heart of what makes people tick.

811
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,550
<35-4,CASTLE>比如  是什么让一个普通人
<35-4,CASTLE>For instance, what would make an ordinary person,

812
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,520
<35-4,CASTLE>比如你
<35-4,CASTLE>like yourself,

813
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,080
<35-4,CASTLE>犯下滔天大罪
<35-4,CASTLE>commit an act that's unusually heinous

814
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,320
<36-1,CASTLE>或是一些
<36-1,CASTLE>or some...

815
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,470
<36-2,BECKETT>不符合人物性格的...
<36-2,BECKETT>out of character...

816
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,870
<35-5,CASTLE>抱歉  我失陪一下
<35-5,CASTLE>Would you excuse me for a-a moment?

818
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,290
<35-7,CASTLE>玛丽的行为不正常
<35-7,CASTLE>Marie was acting out of character.

819
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,320
<35-7,CASTLE>合格的间谍
<35-7,CASTLE>What self-respecting espionage agent

820
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,490
<35-7,CASTLE>怎么会行为怪异
<35-7,CASTLE>would act strangely

821
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,790
<35-7,CASTLE>导致有可能泄露自己的身份呢
<35-7,CASTLE>and risk blowing her cover?

822
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,710
<35-7,CASTLE>也许她不是真正的间谍
<35-7,CASTLE>Maybe she wasn't the real spy.

823
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,700
<35-8,BECKETT>那也许解释了蕾妮刚送来的化验结果
<35-8,BECKETT>Well, that might explain the test results that lanie just sent over.

824
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,430
<35-8,BECKETT>玛丽身体里检测出麻醉药
<35-8,BECKETT>Marie had traces of sodium pentothal in her system.

825
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,410
<35-9,CASTLE>有人给她用了说真话麻醉药
<35-9,CASTLE>Somebody gave her truth serum?

826
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,300
<35-9,CASTLE>也许那才是真正的间谍   白房间  提问题
<35-9,CASTLE>Maybe it was the real spy. The white room, the questions--

827
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,660
<35-9,CASTLE>那就是斯瑞克认为她被外星人绑架的原因
<35-9,CASTLE>That's why Stryker thought she was abducted by aliens.

828
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,310
<35-10,BECKETT>如果玛丽不是间谍
<35-10,BECKETT>Well, if Marie wasn't the spy...

829
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,880
<35-11,CASTLE>那么真正的间谍就是能够
<35-11,CASTLE>Then the real spy is someone with access

830
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,040
<35-11,CASTLE>进入科学中心使用无线电天文望远镜的人
<35-11,CASTLE>to that radio telescope at the science center.

831
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,710
<35-12,BECKETT>我现在就过去
<35-12,BECKETT>I'm heading over there right now.

832
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,290
<35-13,CASTLE>我尽快赶到
<35-13,CASTLE>I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

833
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,520
<35-14,CASTLE>再来点酒吗
<35-14,CASTLE>More wine?

834
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,170
<36-1,CASTLE>又找到一张申请  把望远镜观测方向
<36-1,CASTLE>Got another request here, redirecting the telescope

835
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,290
<36-1,CASTLE>对准了卫星的坐标
<36-1,CASTLE>to the satellite coordinates.

836
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,860
<36-2,BECKETT>就跟其它申请一样  都是玛丽签的
<36-2,BECKETT>Signed by Marie, just like all the others.

837
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,540
<36-2,BECKETT>不管这跟她一贯的行为有多不符
<36-2,BECKETT>Well, out of character or not,

838
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,920
<36-2,BECKETT>看来她就是我们要找的间谍
<36-2,BECKETT>it looks like she was the spy after all.

839
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,510
<36-2,BECKETT>等一下
<36-2,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

840
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,480
<36-3,BECKETT>这两个签名不一样
<36-3,BECKETT>These two signatures are different.

841
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,540
<36-3,BECKETT>a的写法不同
<36-3,BECKETT>The...the a's don't match.

842
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,900
<36-4,CASTLE>没错
<36-4,CASTLE>You're right.

843
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,120
<36-5,CASTLE>看看还有谁那样写a
<36-5,CASTLE>And look who else makes an "a" like that?

844
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,990
<36-6,BECKETT>查尔斯·沃恩博士
<36-6,BECKETT>"Dr. Charles Vaughn".

845
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,070
<36-7,CASTLE>他仿冒玛丽的签名  使她看上去
<36-7,CASTLE>He forged her signatures to make it look as though

846
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:04,100
<36-7,CASTLE>像是那个拦截卫星传送信号的人
<36-7,CASTLE>Marie was the one intercepting the satellite transmissions.

847
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,100
<36-8,BECKETT>那么也许玛丽发现了假冒她签名的申请
<36-8,BECKETT>So maybe Marie saw a request with her fake signature,

848
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,920
<36-8,BECKETT>于是她起了疑心
<36-8,BECKETT>and she got curious.

849
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,950
<36-8,BECKETT>所以她自己递交了申请
<36-8,BECKETT>So she put in a request of her own

850
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,090
<36-8,BECKETT>用望远镜来查看那个区域
<36-8,BECKETT>to have the telescope scan that part of the sky.

851
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,270
<36-9,CASTLE>她就是在那个时候截获了那些奇怪的信号
<36-9,CASTLE>So that's when she intercepted the weird signals.

852
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,060
<36-9,CASTLE>在那之后  她有一段时间精神恍惚
<36-9,CASTLE>After that, she lost time.

853
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,190
<36-10,BECKETT>她跟本尼·斯瑞克说了这件事
<36-10,BECKETT>And then when she told Benny Stryker about it,

854
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,490
<36-10,BECKETT>而他以为她是被外星人绑架了
<36-10,BECKETT>he assumed that she had been abducted...

855
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,600
<36-11,CASTLE>她的确是被绑架了  只不过不是被外星人
<36-11,CASTLE>Which she had been, only not by aliens,

856
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,830
<36-11,CASTLE>而是被沃恩博士绑架了
<36-11,CASTLE>by Dr. Vaughn,

857
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,250
<36-11,CASTLE>他给她下了药  想问出她究竟知道多少
<36-11,CASTLE>who drugged her to figure out how much she knew.

858
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,420
<36-11,CASTLE>当他意识到她已经接近真相了
<36-11,CASTLE>When he realized how close she was,

859
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,100
<36-11,CASTLE>-他就把她除掉了  -没错  但是
<36-11,CASTLE>- he got rid of her.  - Yeah, but he's the one

860
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,150
<36-12,BECKETT>是他把低压舱的线索告诉我们的
<36-12,BECKETT>who told us about the altitude chamber.

861
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,770
<36-13,CASTLE>因为他知道
<36-13,CASTLE>Yeah, because he knew

862
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,770
<36-13,CASTLE>那会把我们引向玛丽的前男友
<36-13,CASTLE>it would lead us to Marie's ex-boyfriend.

863
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,420
<37-1,ESPOSITO>沃恩博士不见了  他不在家
<37-1,ESPOSITO>Dr. Vaughn is gone. He's not at his place.

864
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,570
<37-1,ESPOSITO>你知道我在他家找到了什么吗
<37-1,ESPOSITO>But you know what is?

865
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,570
<37-1,ESPOSITO>三瓶麻醉剂
<37-1,ESPOSITO>Three vials of sodium pentothal.

866
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,020
<37-2,BECKETT>知道他去哪了吗
<37-2,BECKETT>Any idea where he went?

867
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,060
<37-3,ESPOSITO>不知道  但他是匆忙离开的
<37-3,ESPOSITO>No, but it looks like he left in a rush.

868
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,640
<37-4,BECKETT>打给运输安全署  禁止他搭乘任何航班
<37-4,BECKETT>Call TSA and have him put on a no-fly list,

869
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,570
<37-4,BECKETT>有消息就通知我  他开溜了
<37-4,BECKETT>and keep me posted. He's on the run.

870
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,150
<38-1,BECKETT>如果他听说我们要了那些申请表来查验的话
<38-1,BECKETT>If he heard we asked for those request forms,

871
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,300
<38-2,CASTLE>他可能就觉得事情不妙了
<38-2,CASTLE>he would've been tipped off.

872
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,800
<38-3,BECKETT>他可能早就有逃亡计划了
<38-3,BECKETT>He probably had an escape plan in place,

873
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,640
<38-3,BECKETT>就以防他的身份暴露
<38-3,BECKETT>just in case his cover was blown.

874
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,260
<38-4,CASTLE>他还有那些
<38-4,CASTLE>And Chinese handlers

875
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,990
<38-4,CASTLE>可以把他偷渡出国的中国中间人
<38-4,CASTLE>who can smuggle him out of the country.

876
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,870
<38-4,CASTLE>我不是消极
<38-4,CASTLE>Not to be negative,

877
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,100
<38-4,CASTLE>但是逮到这家伙的几率不大呀
<38-4,CASTLE>but the odds of catching this guy are not great.

878
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,330
<38-5,BECKETT>除非我们能得到某位政府探员的帮助
<38-5,BECKETT>Unless we enlist the help of a certain government agent

879
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,580
<38-5,BECKETT>他跟我们一样迫切地想要抓到他
<38-5,BECKETT>who wants him just as bad as we do.

880
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,230
<39-1,WESTFIELD>你们还真是阴魂不散呀
<39-1,WESTFIELD>I may want to put you guys on my friends and family plan.

881
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,050
<39-2,BECKETT>我们现在认为沃恩博士就是那个间谍
<39-2,BECKETT>We now believe that Dr. Vaughn is the spy.

882
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,290
<39-2,BECKETT>玛丽发现了  于是他就把她给杀了
<39-2,BECKETT>Marie figured it out, and then he killed her.

883
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,960
<39-3,WESTFIELD>我不得不同意你的观点
<39-3,WESTFIELD>I'm inclined to agree,

884
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,370
<39-3,WESTFIELD>但这就意味着我们局之前是白忙了一场
<39-3,WESTFIELD>which leaves the agency with some egg on its face.

885
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,440
<39-4,BECKETT>你之前说你是哪个局的来着
<39-4,BECKETT>And which agency did you say that was again?

886
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,230
<39-5,WESTFIELD>我没说过  我们深入调查过沃恩博士
<39-5,WESTFIELD>I didn't. We dug deeper on Dr. Vaughn.

887
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,460
<39-5,WESTFIELD>发现他有赌博的爱好
<39-5,WESTFIELD>Turns out he has a fondness for gambling.

888
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,940
<39-5,WESTFIELD>他在大西洋城的一间中国人开的赌场里
<39-5,WESTFIELD>He ran up quite the tab at an Atlantic city casino

889
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,830
<39-5,WESTFIELD>花了一大笔钱  在那之后
<39-5,WESTFIELD>controlled by the Chinese. After that,

890
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,070
<39-5,WESTFIELD>他就对那些中国人言听计从了
<39-5,WESTFIELD>they owned him.

891
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,610
<39-6,BECKETT>你知道沃恩博士现在在哪吗
<39-6,BECKETT>Do you know where Dr. Vaughn is now?

892
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,310
<39-7,WESTFIELD>我知道该从哪查起
<39-7,WESTFIELD>I know where to start looking.

893
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,730
<40-1,WESTFIELD>我可以通过他的手机号码对他做三角定位
<40-1,WESTFIELD>Using his cell phone number, I can triangulate his position.

894
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,900
<40-2,BECKETT>他肯定担心会被追踪
<40-2,BECKETT>Well, he's gotta be worried about being tracked.

895
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,460
<40-2,BECKETT>大概已经关机了吧
<40-2,BECKETT>He probably turned it off.

896
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,520
<40-3,WESTFIELD>-那我们再给他开机就是了  -你有这本事
<40-3,WESTFIELD>- Then we'll just turn it back on.  - You can do that?

897
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,530
<40-5,WESTFIELD>我们那天晚上不就把你们的手机关了吗
<40-5,WESTFIELD>We turned off your phones, didn't we?

898
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,000
<40-6,CASTLE>没错  还有我们的车
<40-6,CASTLE>Yeah, and the car.

899
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,890
<40-7,WESTFIELD>他在唐人街的仓库区
<40-7,WESTFIELD>He's in the warehouse district in Chinatown.

900
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,600
<40-7,WESTFIELD>运河街1400街区
<40-7,WESTFIELD>1400 block of Canal Street.

901
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,850
<40-8,BECKETT>能再拉近点吗
<40-8,BECKETT>Could we get a closer look?

902
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,990
<40-9,CASTLE>-看到他了  -厉害
<40-9,CASTLE>- There he is.  - Fancy.

903
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,830
<40-9,CASTLE>这离玛丽的弃尸地点
<40-9,CASTLE>That's just a few blocks away

904
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,780
<40-9,CASTLE>只有几个街区而已
<40-9,CASTLE>from where we found Marie's body.

905
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,660
<40-10,BECKETT>也许那就是案发地点
<40-10,BECKETT>Maybe that's where he killed her.

906
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,190
<40-11,CASTLE>那家伙是谁  等一下
<40-11,CASTLE>And who is that guy? Oh, wait.

907
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,220
<40-11,CASTLE>他就是那个抽烟的人
<40-11,CASTLE>He's the cigarette-smoking man.

908
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,780
<40-12,WESTFIELD>又叫做安邱
<40-12,WESTFIELD>Otherwise known as Ung Kyu.

909
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,880
<40-12,WESTFIELD>他是高级别的中国情报探员
<40-12,WESTFIELD>He's a high-level Chinese intelligence agent.

910
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,060
<40-13,BECKETT>这么说我们的疑犯正在见他的中间人
<40-13,BECKETT>So our murder suspect is meeting his handler.

911
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,010
<40-14,WESTFIELD>也就是说数据可能还在沃恩博士手上
<40-14,WESTFIELD>Which means Dr. Vaughn may still have the data.

912
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,680
<40-15,CASTLE>那我们就去抓他吧
<40-15,CASTLE>Well, then let's go get him.

913
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,510
<40-16,CASTLE>那些无人侦察机
<40-16,CASTLE>Where are the predator drones,

914
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,600
<40-16,CASTLE>黑色直升机
<40-16,CASTLE>the black helicopters,

915
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,510
<40-16,CASTLE>还有扯着绳索从天而降的飞虎队去哪了
<40-16,CASTLE>all those SWAT teams rappelling down on ropes?

916
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,860
<40-17,WESTFIELD>经费削减  为了我们国家的安全
<40-17,WESTFIELD>Budget cuts. It's vital to our national security

917
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,530
<40-17,WESTFIELD>我们必须活捉这些人
<40-17,WESTFIELD>that we take these men alive.

918
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,100
<40-18,CASTLE>这些人是训练有素的探员  他们舌头底下
<40-18,CASTLE>These guys are trained agents. They probably have

919
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
<40-18,CASTLE>也许藏着氰化物胶囊呢  一旦被捕就自尽
<40-18,CASTLE>cyanide capsules in their teeth in case they're caught.

920
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,350
<40-19,WESTFIELD>到时候再担心这个吧
<40-19,WESTFIELD>We'll worry about their teeth when the time comes.

921
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,140
<40-20,RYAN>巡逻车封锁了附近五个街区内
<40-20,RYAN>Patrol cars have closed off all streets

922
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,550
<40-21,ESPOSITO>-所有的街道  -空中支援也马上就到
<40-21,ESPOSITO>- in a 5-block radius.  - And air support's on the way.

923
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,630
<40-22,CASTLE>好的  追捕计划是什么
<40-22,CASTLE>All right. What's the plan?

924
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,580
<40-23,WESTFIELD>沃恩的手机信号不见了
<40-23,WESTFIELD>Vaughn's cell phone signal has gone dark,

925
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,230
<40-23,WESTFIELD>也就是说他到地下去了  根据我们的资料
<40-23,WESTFIELD>which means he's underground. According to our intel,

926
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,880
<40-23,WESTFIELD>这栋楼有个巨大的地下室
<40-23,WESTFIELD>this building has an extensive basement

927
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,350
<40-23,WESTFIELD>总共有两个入口
<40-23,WESTFIELD>with two methods of ingress.

928
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,480
<40-24,BECKETT>实际上  这部分街区的多数地下室
<40-24,BECKETT>Actually, most of the basements on this side of town

929
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,070
<40-24,BECKETT>都连着很多逃生通道  是非法移民在
<40-24,BECKETT>are linked through doorways used as escape routes

930
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,980
<40-24,BECKETT>移民局排查时逃跑用的
<40-24,BECKETT>for illegals in case of an INS raid.

931
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,590
<40-25,WESTFIELD>所以你是说沃恩和邱有可能在
<40-25,WESTFIELD>So you're saying that Vaughn and Kyu could be

932
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,050
<40-25,WESTFIELD>隔壁的任何一栋楼里咯
<40-25,WESTFIELD>in either of the adjoining buildings as well?

933
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,840
<40-26,BECKETT>这就是纽约
<40-26,BECKETT>Welcome to New York.

934
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,430
<40-26,BECKETT>我们走
<40-26,BECKETT>Let's go.

935
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,000
<41-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  待着别动
<41-1,BECKETT>NYPD. Stay where you are.

936
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,080
<41-2,CASTLE>一点钟方向有个真空包装机
<41-2,CASTLE>That's a vacuum packer at 1:00.

937
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,720
<41-3,BECKETT>看来我们找到凶器了
<41-3,BECKETT>Looks like we found our murder weapon.

938
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,990
<41-4,BECKETT>你们见过这个人吗
<41-4,BECKETT>Have you seen this man?

940
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,180
<41-6,BECKETT>走吧  走吧
<41-6,BECKETT>Go, go.

941
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,900
<41-7,BECKETT>你出国读过书吗
<41-7,BECKETT>Semester abroad?

942
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,340

<41-8,CASTLE>Nah, a TV show I used to love.

<41-9,BECKETT>Ah. Nice job.

<41-9,BECKETT>谢谢
<41-9,BECKETT>Thanks.

945
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,930
<42-1,KYU>跪下
<42-1,KYU>Get on your knees.

<42-2,VAUGHN>I-I got rid of Marie. I did everything you asked.

948

<42-3,VAUGHN>Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can still help you.

949

<42-3,VAUGHN>等等  等等  等等
<42-3,VAUGHN>Wait. Wait, wait.

950

<42-3,VAUGHN>求你了  我还可以帮到你的  求你了
<42-3,VAUGHN>Please. No, I can still help you. Please.

951
