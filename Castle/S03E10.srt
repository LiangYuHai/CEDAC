1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,850
<1-1,WIFE>我明白你的意思了  安迪
<1-1,WIFE>You've made your point, Andy.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,440
<1-1,WIFE>就算他们关闭了机工车间
<1-1,WIFE>So they closed the machine shop

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,400
<1-1,WIFE>要改造成咖啡店
<1-1,WIFE>and turned it into an espresso bar.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,470
<1-1,WIFE>并不代表你是糟糕的供应商
<1-1,WIFE>That doesn't make you a bad provider.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,520
<1-1,WIFE>听着  别犯傻了  这里可是东河
<1-1,WIFE>Look, this is crazy. It's the East River.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,120
<1-1,WIFE>你在这里只会挨冻患上感冒
<1-1,WIFE>The only thing you're gonna catch out here is a cold.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,000
<1-1,WIFE>来了
<1-1,WIFE>Ooh.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,330
<1-2,WIFE>噢  我的天啊
<1-2,WIFE>Oh, my god.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,570
<2-1,ALEXIS>你能相信吗  我的旧校服竟然还合身
<2-1,ALEXIS>Can you believe my old grade school shirt still fits?

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,090
<2-2,MARTHA RODGERS>哪有合身啊  明明是紧身衣
<2-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, like a glove, yes. A shirt, no.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,820
<2-3,CASTLE>你穿着好象绿巨人[漫画人物]
<2-3,CASTLE>You look like the Incredible Hulk.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,590
<2-4,ALEXIS>敢开我玩笑  老爸
<2-4,ALEXIS>Nice, dad.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,630
<2-5,MARTHA>在他埋头写书时
<2-5,MARTHA>Yeah, that's what you get

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,850
<2-5,MARTHA>跟他说话  都只会招他讥讽
<2-5,MARTHA>when you talk to him while he's writing.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,680
<2-6,ALEXIS>不过  格雷西一定会乐死
<2-6,ALEXIS>Mm. Well, Gracie's gonna love it.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,930
<2-6,ALEXIS>-她要看见了  肯定会笑个不停  -格雷西
<2-6,ALEXIS>- It'll crack her up when she sees it. - Gracie?

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,560
<2-7,CASTLE>那个举家搬离纽约的娇小可爱的娃啊
<2-7,CASTLE>Little cutie whose family moved off to--

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,130
<2-7,CASTLE>-是去了堪萨斯州吧  -在升五年级后
<2-7,CASTLE>- I want to say Kansas? - After fifth grade.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,340
<2-8,ALEXIS>她发邮件给我说要来市里考纽约时装学院
<2-8,ALEXIS>She e-mailed me she was coming to town to check out F.I.T.,

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,000
<2-8,ALEXIS>所以我就叫她来我家过夜
<2-8,ALEXIS>so I told her she could spend the night.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,020
<2-9,ALEXIS>我问过你了
<2-9,ALEXIS>I asked you.

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,360
<2-10,CASTLE>在我写书的时候吗
<2-10,CASTLE>Was I writing?

24
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,870
<2-11,CASTLE>怎么写了"绿巨人"
<2-11,CASTLE>"Incredible Hulk"?

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,820
<3-1,ALEXIS>格雷西
<3-1,ALEXIS>Gracie!

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,030
<3-2,GRACIE>你看你  还是青葱少女耶
<3-2,GRACIE>Look at you, greendale girl.

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,970
<3-3,ALEXIS>看你  变化真大啊
<3-3,ALEXIS>L-look at you.

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,760
<3-4,GRACIE>-好久不见  -好久不见
<3-4,GRACIE>- Hi. - Hi.

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,830
<3-6,ALEXIS>还记得我奶奶和我爸吧
<3-6,ALEXIS>Uh, you remember gram and my dad.

30
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,550
<3-7,GRACIE>当然  真是好久不见了啊
<3-7,GRACIE>Sure. Hey. It's been forever.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,690
<3-8,GRACIE>-谢谢你们让我这里借宿  -哪里
<3-8,GRACIE>- Thanks again for letting me crash with you guys. - Yeah.

32
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,350
<3-10,GRACIE>你没换房间吧
<3-10,GRACIE>So your room in the same place?

33
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,300
<3-11,ALEXIS>对啊  老地方  旧房间
<3-11,ALEXIS>Yeah. Same place, same old room.

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,390
<3-11,ALEXIS>什么都没变  几乎都没变
<3-11,ALEXIS>You know, everything the same. Almost.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,450
<3-13,MARTHA>看来某人早已不是那个堪萨斯少女了
<3-13,MARTHA>Looks like someone's not in Kansas anymore.

37
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,090
<3-14,CASTLE>当初那个扎着马尾  穿着中统袜的
<3-14,CASTLE>What happened to the little hair band,

38
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,840
<3-14,CASTLE>小女孩去哪了
<3-14,CASTLE>the knee socks?

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,040
<3-15,CASTLE>喂  贝克特  打来得真及时
<3-15,CASTLE>Ah, Beckett. Excellent timing.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,440
<4-1,CASTLE>她以前很讨人喜欢的
<4-1,CASTLE>She used to be so adorable.

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,980
<4-1,CASTLE>我意思是  一个好女孩怎会...
<4-1,CASTLE>I mean, what makes a girl--

42
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,170
<4-1,CASTLE>那个过去玩"跳房子"游戏
<4-1,CASTLE>a little girl who used to play hopscotch

43
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,250
<4-1,CASTLE>骑我的小马的女孩
<4-1,CASTLE>and my little ponies--

44
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,990
<4-1,CASTLE>怎会突然就穿了眉环呢
<4-1,CASTLE>suddenly pierce her eyebrow?

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,760
<4-1,CASTLE>就像是她被皮装君主
<4-1,CASTLE>It's like she's been assimilated

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,270
<4-1,CASTLE>同化了似的
<4-1,CASTLE>by the leather overlords.

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,200
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>也许是你把人幻想化了
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>You're probably romanticizing it.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,440
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>不见得小学时代的事
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>And is anything ever really

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,100
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>就真的像我们所记得的那样
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>the way that we remember it in grade school?

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,760
<4-3,CASTLE>坦白说
<4-3,CASTLE>Well, to be honest,

51
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,130
<4-3,CASTLE>除了那些小苏打火山
<4-3,CASTLE>beyond some baking soda volcanoes

52
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,140
<4-3,CASTLE>以及掌心老冒汗
<4-3,CASTLE>and sweaty palms,

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,210
<4-3,CASTLE>我基本把小学的事都忘了
<4-3,CASTLE>I have very little memory of it at all.

54
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,710
<4-3,CASTLE>你呢
<4-3,CASTLE>You?

55
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,580
<4-4,BECKETT>我只记得自己矫过牙
<4-4,BECKETT>Mine are mostly orthodontic.

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,490
<4-5,CASTLE>牙套妹啊
<4-5,CASTLE>Braces?

57
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,470
<4-5,CASTLE>原来你不是天生就笑容炫目的啊
<4-5,CASTLE>You mean you weren't born with that dazzling smile?

58
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,600
<4-6,BECKETT>唯一让我父母炫目的是
<4-6,BECKETT>The only thing dazzling was how long

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,950
<4-6,BECKETT>长时间为了矫牙掏腰包
<4-6,BECKETT>it took my parents to pay for it.

60
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,350
<4-7,BECKETT>这具浮尸基本上没有腐烂
<4-7,BECKETT>Body's in pretty good shape for a floater.

61
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,400
<4-7,BECKETT>一定是刚被投河不久
<4-7,BECKETT>Must not have been in the water too long.

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>要是河水冷得跟我鼻子一样
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>Well, if the river's as cold as my nose,

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,790
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>我推断其死亡时间不超过12个小时
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>I'd ballpark it within the last 12 hours, at most.

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,010
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>没有身份证  但他看来是40岁出头
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>No I.D., but he looks early 40s.

65
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,020
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>他的手臂上有海军纹身
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>He's got a navy tattoo on his arm

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,080
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>颞线上有一道严重的挤压伤
<4-8,LANIE PARISH>and a nasty crush injury along his temporal line.

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,610
<4-9,BECKETT>他会是翻船落水的吗
<4-9,BECKETT>Any chance he went overboard?

68
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,200
<4-10,LANIE>种种迹象表明是人为的钝器伤
<4-10,LANIE>Classic indicators point to deliberate blunt force,

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,420
<4-10,LANIE>所以我看不是
<4-10,LANIE>so I'd say no.

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,530
<4-10,LANIE>他并非死于翻船事故
<4-10,LANIE>This was no boating accident.

71
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,020
<4-11,CASTLE>那我们最好封锁海滨
<4-11,CASTLE>Then we better close the beaches.

72
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,050
<4-11,CASTLE>"并非死于翻船事故"
<4-11,CASTLE>"No boating accident"?

74
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,680
<4-11,CASTLE>知道布罗迪警长吗  那霍普尔呢
<4-11,CASTLE>Chief Brody? Hooper?

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,960
<4-11,CASTLE>不是没看过吧
<4-11,CASTLE>Seriously?

76
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,530
<4-12,LANIE>我会将他的指纹发到辖区  查出他的身份
<4-12,LANIE>I'll, uh, zip his prints over to the precinct for an I.D.,

77
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,270
<4-12,LANIE>另外  不管有没有用  我找到了这个
<4-12,LANIE>but for what it's worth, I did find this.

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,650
<4-13,BECKETT>匿名戒赌互助会奖章
<4-13,BECKETT>A gamblers anonymous medallion.

79
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,150
<4-14,LANIE>要戒赌四年才能得到
<4-14,LANIE>Four years without a bet.

80
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,980
<4-16,BECKETT>-啊  -你"啊"什么
<4-16,BECKETT>- Ahh. - "Ahh," What?

81
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,490
<4-16,BECKETT>死在东河  身上有匿名戒赌互助会币
<4-16,BECKETT>The East River, a G.A. Chip?

82
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,610
<4-17,CASTLE>复赌的赌徒欠了他的赌博经纪太多
<4-17,CASTLE>Relapsed gambler gets in too deep with his bookie,

83
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,500
<4-17,CASTLE>结果落得浮尸河里的下场
<4-17,CASTLE>ends up floating in the drink.

84
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,760
<4-18,BECKETT>你在开玩笑吗
<4-18,BECKETT>Are you kidding me?

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,020
<4-18,BECKETT>一下子就从匿名戒赌互助会跳到黑帮暗杀
<4-18,BECKETT>You just went from gamblers anonymous to mob hit?

86
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,190
<4-19,CASTLE>这可是泽西湿地这边
<4-19,CASTLE>This is the most celebrated body depository

87
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,480
<4-19,CASTLE>最经典的弃尸手法啊
<4-19,CASTLE>this side of the Jersey wetlands.

88
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,090
<4-19,CASTLE>听我的错不了  这家伙与黑帮有关
<4-19,CASTLE>Mark my words-- this guy has mob ties.

89
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,880
<4-20,CASTLE>结案了
<4-20,CASTLE>Case closed.

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,300
<5-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他和黑帮无关
<5-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>No mob ties.

91
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,310
<5-2,CASTLE>你查清楚了吗
<5-2,CASTLE>Are you sure?

92
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,880
<5-3,CASTLE>做得好
<5-3,CASTLE>Good work.

93
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,670
<5-4,ESPOSITO>根据指纹查询结果  他名叫唐纳德·海耶斯
<5-4,ESPOSITO>According to his fingerprints, his name is Donald Hayes--

94
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,660

<5-4,ESPOSITO>and he's been a dock worker since '94.

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,920
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>不知怎的  他人仍在上班
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>And somehow still employed as one.

98
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>本案的死者唐尼·海耶斯
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>Our victim Donny Hayes--

99

100
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,760
<5-6,CASTLE>也就是说
<5-6,CASTLE>Which either means

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,860
<5-6,CASTLE>他是一具很热爱工作的僵尸
<5-6,CASTLE>he's an incredibly dedicated zombie...

102
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,040
<5-7,BECKETT>又或者是本起谋杀案的疑犯
<5-7,BECKETT>Or he's a suspect in our murder.

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,040
<5-7,BECKETT>唐尼
<5-7,BECKETT>Donny.

106
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,600
<6-2,CASTLE>你是怎么了  忘了自己的名字了吗
<6-2,CASTLE>What's the matter? You forget your own name?

107
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,960
<6-3,RYAN>警察  别跑
<6-3,RYAN>Police. Don't move.

108
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,690
<6-4,ESPOSITO>我拍档不是说"别跑"嘛
<6-4,ESPOSITO>The man said, "Don't move."

109
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,660
<6-5,GRANT VYRO>噢  等一下
<6-5,GRANT VYRO>Oh. Wait a minute.

<6-5,GRANT VYRO>Wait a minute. You're just cops?

111
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,440
<6-6,RYAN>警察而已
<6-6,RYAN>Just cops?

112
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,300
<6-7,BECKETT>照你这么说  你不过也就是因涉嫌谋杀被捕"而已"
<6-7,BECKETT>I guess that makes you just under arrest for murder.

113
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,920
<7-1,BECKETT>名为格兰特  姓维罗
<7-1,BECKETT>First name Grant, Last name Vyro.

114
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,290
<7-2,GRANT>我可没杀人
<7-2,GRANT>I didn't kill anybody.

115
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,270
<7-4,GRANT>-那你干嘛跑啊  -我以为你们是工会的人
<7-4,GRANT>- Then why'd you run? - I thought you was with union.

116
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,080
<7-5,BECKETT>这么说不只是我们在追查
<7-5,BECKETT>Oh, so we're not the only ones who have a problem

117
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,780
<7-5,BECKETT>你为了夺取工会卡而杀了唐尼这件事啊
<7-5,BECKETT>with you killing Donny for his union card?

118
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,020
<7-6,GRANT>你在说什么  那卡是我买的
<7-6,GRANT>What are you talking about? I bought that card.

119
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,380
<7-7,BECKETT>你真的以为我们会相信
<7-7,BECKETT>Do you really expect us to believe

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,900
<7-7,BECKETT>你只是买了唐尼的卡  偷了他的身份
<7-7,BECKETT>that you bought Donny's card, assumed his identity,

121
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,060
<7-7,BECKETT>自以为神不知鬼不觉吗
<7-7,BECKETT>and thought no one would notice?

122
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,330
<7-8,GRANT>这家伙在曼哈顿西区工作了16年
<7-8,GRANT>Guy spent 16 years working over on the West Side.

123
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,950
<7-8,GRANT>所以我才转来东区的码头打工
<7-8,GRANT>So I switched to the east side docks

124
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,900
<7-8,GRANT>那样认识唐尼的人就不会发现
<7-8,GRANT>so no one who knew Donny would catch on.

125
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
<7-9,CASTLE>自从购买他人工会卡视为犯法后
<7-9,CASTLE>So what does a union card go for nowadays

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,560
<7-9,CASTLE>今时今日一张工会卡要多少钱啊
<7-9,CASTLE>since buying someone else's is illegal?

127
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,140
<7-10,GRANT>-花了我两万五千美元  -少扯了  维罗
<7-10,GRANT>- Sucker cost me 25 grand. - Oh, come on, Vyro.

128
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,060
<7-11,BECKETT>码头工每年有超过6位数的进账
<7-11,BECKETT>Dock workers rake in over six figures a year.

129
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,730
<7-11,BECKETT>唐尼怎会愿意把卡贱卖给你
<7-11,BECKETT>Why would Donny trade it in for so little?

130
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,160
<7-12,CASTLE>除非你拿枪抵着他的头
<7-12,CASTLE>Unless he had a gun to his head,

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,880
<7-12,CASTLE>-所以他才能讨价还价  -我哪来的枪啊
<7-12,CASTLE>- in which case, it'd be a bargain. - There were no guns.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
<7-13,GRANT>-我要找工作  唐尼要现金  -要来做什么
<7-13,GRANT>- I needed a job. Donny needed cash. - For what?

133
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,880
<7-13,GRANT>他没说  我也不在乎
<7-13,GRANT>He didn't say, and I didn't care.

135
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,270
<8-1,LANIE>我说他的头部遭钝器所伤是对的
<8-1,LANIE>I was right about the blunt force trauma.

136
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,560
<8-1,LANIE>一记重击狠狠砸在
<8-1,LANIE>A single blow caved in the ridge here

137
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,490
<8-1,LANIE>鳞缝上的脑脊这里
<8-1,LANIE>along Donny's squamosal suture.

138
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,830
<8-1,LANIE>不管凶器是什么  它在死者的头骨里
<8-1,LANIE>And whatever did the damage was kind enough

139
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,530
<8-1,LANIE>留下了这块红色玻璃碎片
<8-1,LANIE>to leave this shard of red glass embedded in his skull.

140
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
<8-2,CASTLE>会是一个大花瓶或大玻璃瓶吗
<8-2,CASTLE>Maybe a heavy vase or a bottle?

141
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,190
<8-3,BECKETT>我会让鉴证组查一下的
<8-3,BECKETT>I'll have forensics take a look at it,

142
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,670
<8-3,BECKETT>看能不能找到匹配的凶器
<8-3,BECKETT>see if they can find a match.

143
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,670
<8-4,LANIE>根据尸斑和水温
<8-4,LANIE>Based on lividity and water temp,

144
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,950
<8-4,LANIE>我把死亡时间缩窄在
<8-4,LANIE>I've narrowed time of death

145
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,660
<8-4,LANIE>今早凌晨4点到6点之间
<8-4,LANIE>to between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. this morning.

146
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,330
<8-5,BECKETT>-肩膀这伤是怎么造成的  -大号铅弹
<8-5,BECKETT>- What happened here on the shoulder? - Buckshot.

147
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,310
<8-6,LANIE>我在他的左臂找到几颗
<8-6,LANIE>I found several double-ought pellets

148
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,590
<8-6,LANIE>卡在肉里的点33口径铅弹
<8-6,LANIE>lodged in the flesh of his left arm.

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,380
<8-7,CASTLE>就是说有人重击他的头部  然后朝他开了枪
<8-7,CASTLE>So someone conked him on the head and shot him?

150
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,100
<8-8,LANIE>怪就怪在这儿了  伤疤表明
<8-8,LANIE>That's where it gets weird. Scarring indicates

151
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,450
<8-8,LANIE>铅块在他体内已经两三周了
<8-8,LANIE>The pellets have been there about two to three weeks.

152
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,590
<8-9,CASTLE>他就这么留着不管
<8-9,CASTLE>And he just left 'em in there?

153
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,630
<8-10,LANIE>反正他没去就医
<8-10,LANIE>Well, he certainly didn't seek treatment.

154
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,550
<8-10,LANIE>也许他卷入了什么非法勾当
<8-10,LANIE>Could've been, he was in something illegal

155
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,620
<8-10,LANIE>-或者是害怕那个枪击他的人  -或者两者皆是
<8-10,LANIE>- Or scared of whoever shot him.  - Or both.

156
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,130
<9-1,RYAN>可以排除维罗了
<9-1,RYAN>Forget Vyro.

157
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,990
<9-1,RYAN>他的不在场证明成立  我们查到
<9-1,RYAN>His alibi cleared, and we tracked down

158
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,400
<9-1,RYAN>有张两万五千美元的私人支票
<9-1,RYAN>his personal check for $25,000,

159
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,600
<9-1,RYAN>上个月被唐尼存入了个人账户
<9-1,RYAN>endorsed and deposited by Donny last month.

160
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,550
<9-2,CASTLE>维罗付给唐尼一张支票
<9-2,CASTLE>Vyro paid Donny with a check?

161
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,030
<9-3,BECKETT>不够"黑帮"吗  卡塞尔
<9-3,BECKETT>Not mobby enough for you, Castle?

162
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,780
<9-4,RYAN>鉴证组还在检查唐尼的住处
<9-4,RYAN>CSU's still combing Donny's place,

163
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,820
<9-4,RYAN>但没发现红色玻璃的碎片
<9-4,RYAN>but no broken red glass,

164
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,390
<9-4,RYAN>也没有跟谋杀相关的线索
<9-4,RYAN>no signs of foul play,

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,620
<9-4,RYAN>也没发现亲属
<9-4,RYAN>and no next of kin, either.

166
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,390
<9-5,BECKETT>那个匿名戒赌互助会的奖章呢
<9-5,BECKETT>What about the gamblers anonymous chip?

167
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,480
<9-6,RYAN>-查到保证人 了吗  -查到了
<9-6,RYAN>- Any sponsor? - Yeah, but he

168
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,700
<9-6,RYAN>但他说几个月没有唐尼的消息了
<9-6,RYAN>says he hasn't heard from Donny for months.

169
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,210
<9-7,BECKETT>所以卡塞尔也许是对的
<9-7,BECKETT>So then maybe castle was right.

170
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,850
<9-7,BECKETT>如果唐尼走投无路到变卖他的工会卡
<9-7,BECKETT>If Donny was desperate enough to sell his union card,

171
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,290
<9-7,BECKETT>那他也许真是赌瘾复发
<9-7,BECKETT>then maybe he fell off the wagon and

172
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,730
<9-7,BECKETT>欠了一屁股债
<9-7,BECKETT>got in over his head.

173
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,160
<9-8,CASTLE>是啊  两万五可不是小数目
<9-8,CASTLE>Yeah, to the tune of 25 grand.

174
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,590
<9-9,ESPOSITO>伙计们  那是虚报的金额
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Yo. Uh, that'd be lowballing it, bro.

175
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,220
<9-9,ESPOSITO>唐尼的户头显示  他一个月前
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Donny's account shows that he deposited Vyro's check

176
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,660
<9-9,ESPOSITO>存入了维罗的支票
<9-9,ESPOSITO>about a month ago,

177
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,980
<9-9,ESPOSITO>外加他的个人存款中
<9-9,ESPOSITO>adding it to his existing balance

178
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,430
<9-9,ESPOSITO>12万5千美元
<9-9,ESPOSITO>of $125,000,

179
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,370
<9-9,ESPOSITO>而这些钱  看好了
<9-9,ESPOSITO>All of which--wait for it--

180
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,450
<9-9,ESPOSITO>现在都没了
<9-9,ESPOSITO>is now gone.

181
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,620
<9-11,CASTLE>-没了  -全部吗
<9-11,CASTLE>- Gone?  - All of it?

182
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,980
<9-12,ESPOSITO>只剩了6美元23美分
<9-12,ESPOSITO>Except for the remaining balance of $6.23,

183
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,380
<9-12,ESPOSITO>其余的十五万都换成了一张大额支票
<9-12,ESPOSITO>all the 150k was spent in one giant check,

184
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,720
<9-12,ESPOSITO>付给了一个叫做威尔伯·皮特里诺的人
<9-12,ESPOSITO>made payable to a Wilbur Pittorino,

185
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
<9-12,ESPOSITO>这里显示此人拥有多处不动产
<9-12,ESPOSITO>Listed here as owning several properties,

186
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,670
<9-12,ESPOSITO>其中一项是废物处理业务
<9-12,ESPOSITO>as well as a waste management business

187
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,290
<9-12,ESPOSITO>厂址在新泽西的加菲尔德
<9-12,ESPOSITO>in Garfield, New Jersey.

188
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,020
<9-13,CASTLE>废物处理业务
<9-13,CASTLE>Oh! Waste management.

189
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,830
<9-14,BECKETT>-有前科吗  -有
<9-14,BECKETT>- Any priors?  - Yeah.

190
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,890
<9-15,ESPOSITO>1977年  比利·皮特在联邦监狱坐了十年牢
<9-15,ESPOSITO>Back in 1977, Billy Pitt spent 10 years in federal

191
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,870
<9-15,ESPOSITO>罪名是非法袭击他人和敲诈勒索
<9-15,ESPOSITO>for assault and racketeering.

192
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,480
<9-16,CASTLE>-和啥  -敲诈勒索
<9-16,CASTLE>- And what?  - Racketeering.

193
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,750
<9-17,ESPOSITO>他还在进行他的外围下注操作的地方
<9-17,ESPOSITO>As well as shaking down business owners

194
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,290
<9-17,ESPOSITO>勒索了一些企业业主
<9-17,ESPOSITO>where he operated his, uh, bookmaking operation.

195
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,710
<9-18,CASTLE>-他的啥  -外围下注操作
<9-18,CASTLE>- His what now?  - Bookmaking operation.

196
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,800
<9-19,ESPOSITO>哦  这么说  一个前赌徒
<9-19,ESPOSITO>Oh, so an ex-gambler

197
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,690
<9-20,CASTLE>把毕生的积蓄交给了一个搞外围下注的前科犯
<9-20,CASTLE>dumps his life savings on an ex-con ex-bookmaker,

198
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,400
<9-20,CASTLE>最后却被清理出局了
<9-20,CASTLE>and ends up exed out.

199
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,520
<9-21,BECKETT>听起来像是唐尼还给比利·皮特的十五万付晚了
<9-21,BECKETT>Sounds like Donny was late with his 150 grand for Billy Pitt,

200
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,020
<9-21,BECKETT>最终只能以生命来还债了
<9-21,BECKETT>and he ended up paying for it with his life.

201
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,390
<9-22,CASTLE>我说的不就这意思么
<9-22,CASTLE>I think I just said that.

206
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,260
<10-1,BECKETT>皮特先生  您的头发可能白了一些
<10-1,BECKETT>You know, you might have gotten a little grayer, Mr. Pitt,

207
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,250
<10-1,BECKETT>但在我看来  您并无太大变化
<10-1,BECKETT>but it seems to me, you haven't changed much at all.

208
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,340
<10-2,BILLY PITT>肯定是上普拉提课的功劳
<10-2,BILLY PITT>Must be all them pilates classes.

209
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,160
<10-3,BECKETT>你认得这张支票吗
<10-3,BECKETT>Do you recognize this check?

210
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
<10-4,BILLY>当然  唐尼·海耶斯给的  有何问题
<10-4,BILLY>Of course. It's from Donny Hayes. So?

211
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,820
<10-5,BECKETT>我在想  如果唐尼没欠你那么多钱
<10-5,BECKETT>So I'm wondering if Donny didn't owe you more money,

212
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,310
<10-5,BECKETT>你也没回到过去敲诈勒索的日子
<10-5,BECKETT>and you didn't flash back to your old racketeering days.

213
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,340
<10-5,BECKETT>等等  美女
<10-5,BECKETT>Tap the brakes, sweetie.

214
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,710
<10-6,BILLY>不管你把我找来所为何事
<10-6,BILLY>Whatever the hell you dragged me down here for,

215
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,330
<10-6,BILLY>我现在就可以告诉你
<10-6,BILLY>I wanna tell you right now that

216
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,130
<10-6,BILLY>我几辈子前就跟强尼·劳两清了
<10-6,BILLY>I paid my tab with Johnny Law a couple of lifetimes ago,

217
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,440
<10-6,BILLY>他后来再也没逮到过我
<10-6,BILLY>and he's got nothing on me since.

218
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,690
<11-1,CASTLE>赞  这人太经典了
<11-1,CASTLE>Oh, this guy is gold.

219
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,590
<11-1,CASTLE>你要是不信我  不如去问问...唐尼
<11-1,CASTLE>And if you don't believe me, why don't you ask... Donny?

220
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,570
<12-1,BILLY>唐尼出事了是吗
<12-1,BILLY>Is this about donny?

221
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,190
<12-2,BECKETT>今早在纽约东河  有人发现了他的尸体
<12-2,BECKETT>He was found dead in the east river this morning.

222
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
<12-2,BECKETT>现在回到钱的问题上  这钱到底是干什么的
<12-2,BECKETT>Now back to the money. What was it for?

223
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,460
<12-2,BECKETT>是还款  还是礼物
<12-2,BECKETT>Was it a payment or was it a gift?

224
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,350
<12-3,BILLY>-是买卖  -买什么
<12-3,BILLY>- A purchase. - For?

225
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,290
<12-5,BILLY>他买了我在市中心的酒吧  他喜欢那地方
<12-5,BILLY>He bought my bar downtown. He loved the place.

226
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,000
<12-6,BECKETT>是吗  喜欢到舍弃了一切
<12-6,BECKETT>Really? Enough to drop everything

227
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,040
<12-6,BECKETT>并为之倾尽了毕生的积蓄吗
<12-6,BECKETT>and dump his whole life savings into it?

228
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,230
<12-7,BILLY>那孩子是在那长大的
<12-7,BILLY>Kid was practically raised in the joint,

229
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,430
<12-7,BILLY>他的外公抚养了他  传奇里奥
<12-7,BILLY>by his grandfather, Leo the legend.

230
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>-传奇里奥  -你听说过
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>- Leo the legend?  - You heard of the guy?

231
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>他是城里最好的酒保
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>City's best bartender

232
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,470
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>当时"基佬"只有"快乐"的意思
<13-2,ROY MONTGOMERY>since the days when "Gay" meant "Happy."

234
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,640
<14-1,BILLY>他是唐尼唯一的亲人
<14-1,BILLY>He was the only father Donny knew.

235
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,610
<14-2,BECKETT>在哪能找到里奥
<14-2,BECKETT>And where do I find Leo?

236
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,130
<14-2,BECKETT>他在酒吧后面的银色调酒罐里安息着呢
<14-2,BECKETT>Resting in an old silver shaker behind the bar.

237
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,720
<14-3,BILLY>里奥算是"酒吧历史学家"了
<14-3,BILLY>Leo was kind of the bar historian,

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,900
<14-3,BILLY>97年他被开除后
<14-3,BILLY>and when he kicked in '97,

239
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,370
<14-3,BILLY>我们想  何不拉他入伙呢
<14-3,BILLY>we figured, hey, why not make him part of it?

240
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,780
<15-2,BECKETT>酒吧后的骨灰
<15-2,BECKETT>Ashes behind the bar.

241
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,380
<15-3,BILLY>所以唐尼才决定买下  酒吧叫什么名字
<15-3,BILLY>Which is why Donny decided to buy the--what is it called?

242
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,740
<15-4,CASTLE>-"老地方"  -"老地方"
<15-4,CASTLE>- The old haunt.  - The old haunt?

243
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,050
<15-5,ESPOSITO>别告诉我你们没去过那个地方
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Don't tell me you've never been to the old haunt.

244
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,350
<15-6,CASTLE>那是传奇啊  所有的好作家都在那喝酒
<15-6,CASTLE>It's legendary. All the great writers drank there.

245
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,630
<15-7,RYAN>-咱是警察  咱有警察常去的酒吧  -遗憾啊
<15-7,RYAN>- We're cops. We go to cop bars.  - Your loss.

246
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,640
<15-7,RYAN>总之  唐尼每晚都在那里
<15-7,RYAN>Donny was there every night anyhow.

247
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,790
<16-1,BILLY>我们是他唯一的亲人了
<16-1,BILLY>We were all the family he had.

248
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,320
<16-2,BECKETT>那这次突然的买卖是怎么回事
<16-2,BECKETT>So what prompted this sudden sale?

249
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,070
<16-2,BECKETT>貌似唐尼需要在很短的时间内筹够钱才行
<16-2,BECKETT>I mean, it seemed like Donny had to gather money pretty quickly.

250
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,980
<16-3,BILLY>酒吧只赔不赚已经好几年了
<16-3,BILLY>The bar had been weighing down my ledger sheets for years.

251
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,890
<16-3,BILLY>本来TJ麦克查纳连锁店提出买我的酒吧
<16-3,BILLY>I had an offer from one of them T.J. Mcchucklenuts franchises,

252
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,070
<16-3,BILLY>不过我的酒保布莱恩  找了几个投资者
<16-3,BILLY>when Brian, my bartender, put together some investors

253
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,540
<16-3,BILLY>也提出想买我的酒吧
<16-3,BILLY>and made an offer of his own.

254
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,910
<16-3,BILLY>我本来就要卖给他了
<16-3,BILLY>I was gonna sell it to him,

255
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,640
<16-3,BILLY>结果唐尼出了更高的价格
<16-3,BILLY>and then donny outbid him.

256
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,090
<16-4,BECKETT>那唐尼买下了酒吧  布莱恩做何感想
<16-4,BECKETT>And how did Brian feel when donny bought the place?

257
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,160
<16-5,BILLY>他当然不太高兴
<16-5,BILLY>He wasn't thrilled about it,

258
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,480
<16-5,BILLY>但他起码不用为TJ麦克查纳工作了
<16-5,BILLY>But at least he wasn't working for T.J. Mcchucklenuts.

259
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,770
<17-1,BECKETT>蕾妮检查了玻璃碎片
<17-1,BECKETT>Lanie just swabbed the shard of glass

260
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,950
<17-1,BECKETT>发现有微量酒精成分
<17-1,BECKETT>and found trace amounts of alcohol.

261
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,270
<17-2,CASTLE>一个装酒精饮料的瓶子
<17-2,CASTLE>A container of alcoholic beverage,

262
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,690
<17-2,CASTLE>一个充满怨恨的酒保
<17-2,CASTLE>A resentful bartender...

263
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,780
<17-3,BECKETT>而且考虑到"老地方"所处的位置
<17-3,BECKETT>And given the location of the old haunt,

264
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,690
<17-3,BECKETT>一个距离河边两个街区的潜在犯罪现场
<17-3,BECKETT>a potential crime scene just two blocks

265
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,370
<17-3,BECKETT>就呼之欲出了
<17-3,BECKETT>away from the river.

266
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,820
<17-4,CASTLE>实在是居家旅行  杀人灭口  必备场所
<17-4,CASTLE>Convenient for all your body dumping needs.

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
<17-5,BECKETT>我说  卡塞尔
<17-5,BECKETT>So, Castle...

268
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,310
<17-5,BECKETT>要我请你喝一杯吗
<17-5,BECKETT>Can I buy you a drink?

269
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,140
<17-6,CASTLE>贝克特探长  我等你这句话等得花都谢了
<17-6,CASTLE>Why, Detective Beckett, I thought you'd never ask.

270
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,910
<18-1,BECKETT>你对这酒吧了解多少  卡塞尔
<18-1,BECKETT>so how well do you know this bar, castle?

271
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,610
<18-2,CASTLE>我好几年没来了  阿丽克西斯出生后就没来过
<18-2,CASTLE>Oh, I haven't been here in years. Not since Alexis.

272
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,420
<18-2,CASTLE>不过我的第一本小说就是在这里写出来的
<18-2,CASTLE>But I wrote most of my first novel in one of these booths.

273
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,370
<18-3,BECKETT>原来如此  难怪了
<18-3,BECKETT>Oh. Okay, well, that explains a lot.

274
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,340
<18-4,CASTLE>那小说卖出了三百多万本
<18-4,CASTLE>It sold over three million copies.

275
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,200
<18-5,BECKETT>我是说  故地重游  难怪你这么激动
<18-5,BECKETT>No, I mean why you're so excited.

276
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,960
<18-6,CASTLE>这里可承载着历史啊
<18-6,CASTLE>Oh, well, it's loaded with history--

277
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,170
<18-6,CASTLE>最初是个铁匠铺  后来变成了妓院
<18-6,CASTLE>First as a blacksmith, then as a bordello.

278
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,380
<18-6,CASTLE>它在禁酒令期间成为地下酒吧
<18-6,CASTLE>It only became a bar during prohibition as a speakeasy,

279
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,970
<18-6,CASTLE>一度是最好的酒吧之一
<18-6,CASTLE>and it was one of the best.

280
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,870
<18-6,CASTLE>我发誓  我现在仍能感受到
<18-6,CASTLE>I swear, I can still feel the vibration

281
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,590
<18-6,CASTLE>这些墙里沉淀着的
<18-6,CASTLE>of every notorious episode of glamour and debauchery

282
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,290
<18-6,CASTLE>魅惑和堕落
<18-6,CASTLE>in its walls.

283
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,230
<18-7,BECKETT>别激动  卡塞尔  只是个酒吧
<18-7,BECKETT>Oh, easy, Castle. It's just a bar.

284
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,690
<18-8,CASTLE>不  TJ麦克查纳才只是个酒吧
<18-8,CASTLE>No, no, T.J. Mcchucklenuts is just a bar.

285
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,500
<18-8,CASTLE>"老地方"可是酒吧界濒临绝种的
<18-8,CASTLE>The old haunt is the last of a dying breed

286
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,480
<18-8,CASTLE>稀有圣地
<18-8,CASTLE>of proud institutions

287
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,810
<18-8,CASTLE>笑看着城市变得越来越高级  越来越无情
<18-8,CASTLE>standing up to ruthless gentrification.

288
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,200
<18-8,CASTLE>它是个经典的...
<18-8,CASTLE>It's a classic...

289
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,730
<18-9,CASTLE>你  你干嘛
<18-9,CASTLE>What--what are you doing?

290
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
<18-10,BECKETT>我要找布莱恩套话
<18-10,BECKETT>Well, I'm not gonna get much out of Brian

291
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,280
<18-10,BECKETT>可不能弄个警察造型
<18-10,BECKETT>looking like a cop.

292
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,550
<18-11,CASTLE>隐藏身份  我喜欢
<18-11,CASTLE>Undercover. I like it.

293
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,890
<18-11,CASTLE>不过保险起见  最好再开一颗扣子
<18-11,CASTLE>But you might want to pop one more button, just in case.

294
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,850
<19-1,CASTLE>-酒吧就该是这个味儿  -是啊  陈啤酒
<19-1,CASTLE>- This is how a bar should smell.  - Yeah. Stale beer.

295
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,830
<19-3,CASTLE>知道吗  要是多几家这样的酒吧
<19-3,CASTLE>You know, I'd write in more bars

296
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,040
<19-3,CASTLE>我就不用偏偏跑到这里写作了
<19-3,CASTLE>if there were more bars like this.

297
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,010
<19-4,CASTLE>你好啊  艾迪
<19-4,CASTLE>Nice to see you, Eddie.

298
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,090
<19-4,CASTLE>好久不见  多谢你还记得我
<19-4,CASTLE>Been a long time. Thank you for remembering.

299
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,500
<19-5,CASTLE>过来  来看看名人墙
<19-5,CASTLE>Come over here. Check out the wall of fame.

300
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,460
<19-6,CASTLE>这位帅哥是谁啊  在海明威上面两排
<19-6,CASTLE>Who is that handsome devil just two over from Hemingway,

301
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,620
<19-6,CASTLE>就在那个我写出《枪林弹雨中》的
<19-6,CASTLE>directly above the infamous booth where

302
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,120
<19-6,CASTLE>隔间的正上方
<19-6,CASTLE>"In a hail of bullets" was born?

303
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,610
<19-7,BECKETT>哦买糕啊  卡塞尔
<19-7,BECKETT>Oh, my goodness, castle.

304
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,400
<19-7,BECKETT>你以前好可爱啊
<19-7,BECKETT>you were so cute back then.

305
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,510
<19-8,CASTLE>现在不可爱吗
<19-8,CASTLE>Back then?

306
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,650
<19-9,CASTLE>充满回忆啊
<19-9,CASTLE>A lot of memories.

307
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,270
<19-10,BECKETT>那是老里奥的骨灰  那个小孩就应该是唐尼
<19-10,BECKETT>That's old Leo, which would make that young Donny.

308
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,910
<19-10,BECKETT>但我没看到有红色酒瓶啊
<19-10,BECKETT>But I don't see any red bottles.

309
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,110
<19-11,BECKETT>你在看什么呢
<19-11,BECKETT>What are you looking at?

310
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,090
<19-12,CASTLE>没什么
<19-12,CASTLE>Nothing.

311
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,270
<19-13,BRIAN>欢迎光临"老地方"  朋友们
<19-13,BRIAN>Welcome to the Old Haunt, folks.

312
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,850
<19-14,BECKETT>唐尼在吗
<19-14,BECKETT>Uh, is Donny here, by any chance?

313
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,260
<19-15,BRIAN>不在  不过一会儿就到了  他绝对不会
<19-15,BRIAN>Not yet, but he will be, and he won't mind one bit

314
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,390
<19-15,BRIAN>介意你坐了他一贯的位子的
<19-15,BRIAN>that you're sitting in his regular spot.

315
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,790
<19-16,BECKETT>怪不得  我一坐这儿就觉得很亲切
<19-16,BECKETT>You know, I knew this place felt right for a reason.

316
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,720
<19-16,BECKETT>我叫凯特  是他一个老朋友
<19-16,BECKETT>I'm Kate. I'm one of his old friends.

317
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,900
<19-17,BECKETT>这位是里克
<19-17,BECKETT>And this is Rick.

318
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,660
<19-17,BECKETT>我是布莱恩
<19-17,BECKETT>Brian.

319
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,220
<19-18,BRIAN>唐尼的朋友
<19-18,BRIAN>And any old friend of Donny

320
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,510
<19-18,BRIAN>也就是我的朋友
<19-18,BRIAN>is a new friend of mine.

321
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,530
<19-19,BECKETT>请问一下  布莱恩
<19-19,BECKETT>Tell me, Brian, um...

322
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,070
<19-19,BECKETT>你们这儿有没有一种烈酒
<19-19,BECKETT>You don't by any chance carry a liqueur--

323
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,610
<19-19,BECKETT>口感醇厚
<19-19,BECKETT>It's really delicious

324
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,130
<19-19,BECKETT>而且是用红色酒瓶装着
<19-19,BECKETT>and it comes in this red bottle?

325
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,160
<19-20,CASTLE>对了  是我们在火地岛的小酒馆
<19-20,CASTLE>Yeah, that, uh, red bottle we shared

326
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,950
<19-20,CASTLE>喝的那种用红色瓶子装的酒吗
<19-20,CASTLE>down in that little cantina in Tierra del Fuego?

327
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,770
<19-21,BRIAN>红色是吧
<19-21,BRIAN>Red, huh?

328
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,160
<19-21,BRIAN>让我找找
<19-21,BRIAN>Uh, let's see.

329
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,840
<19-21,BRIAN>没红色的  只有常见的棕色  绿色和透明的
<19-21,BRIAN>No red here. Just your standard brown, green, and clear.

330
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,860
<19-21,BRIAN>-我去那边找找  -你看到没
<19-21,BRIAN>- Uh, let me check the other end of the bar.  - Did you see that?

331
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,900
<19-23,CASTLE>怎么可能没看到  难道他不知道我们是一对儿吗
<19-23,CASTLE>How could I miss it? Can't he see we're together?

332
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,880
<19-23,CASTLE>我们的卧底身份
<19-23,CASTLE>Undercover.

333
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,560
<19-24,BECKETT>不是说那个  是他的反应
<19-24,BECKETT>No, his reaction...

334
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,100
<19-24,BECKETT>当我提到唐尼的时候
<19-24,BECKETT>When I mentioned Donny.

335
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,560
<19-24,BECKETT>他好像不知道
<19-24,BECKETT>I don't think he knows.

336
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,150
<19-25,CASTLE>也许他很擅长掩饰
<19-25,CASTLE>Maybe he's just a good liar.

337
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,170
<19-26,BRIAN>没找到啊
<19-26,BRIAN>Ah, no luck.

338
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,180
<19-26,BRIAN>要不要试下蓝伏特加
<19-26,BRIAN>Maybe I could interest you in a blue vodka?

339
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,430
<19-27,BECKETT>哦  不用了  还不到喝那个的时候呢
<19-27,BECKETT>Oh, no, thank you. Way too early for vodka.

340
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,520
<19-28,BRIAN>先考虑下吧  朋友们  我马上回来
<19-28,BRIAN>Well, think about it, folks. I'll be back in a sec.

341
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,530
<19-29,BECKETT>事实上  布莱恩  我们不是来喝酒的
<19-29,BECKETT>Actually, Brian, we're not really here for a drink.

342
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,650
<20-1,BRIAN>唐尼怎么可能死了呢
<20-1,BRIAN>How could Donny be dead?

343
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,320
<20-1,BRIAN>我昨晚还跟他在一起
<20-1,BRIAN>I was just with him last night.

344
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,580
<20-2,BECKETT>什么时候
<20-2,BECKETT>What time was that?

345
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,920
<20-3,BRIAN>凌晨四点半  我下班时把门锁上了
<20-3,BRIAN>4:30 a.m. I locked up on my way out,

346
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,140
<20-3,BRIAN>唐尼和往常一样到办公室去整理账单去了
<20-3,BRIAN>and Donny went to do the books in the office, like always.

347
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,380
<20-4,BECKETT>你确定你走的时候他是一个人吗
<20-4,BECKETT>Are you sure he was alone when you left?

348
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,880
<20-5,BRIAN>确定无疑  这简直太不可思议了
<20-5,BRIAN>Positive. Man, this is crazy.

349
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,510
<20-5,BRIAN>他跟我情同兄弟
<20-5,BRIAN>That guy was like a brother to me.

350
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,590
<20-6,CASTLE>尽管他买下了你也想买的这个酒吧
<20-6,CASTLE>Even though he bought the bar out from under you?

351
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,690
<20-7,BRIAN>你知道这件事
<20-7,BRIAN>You know about that?

352
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,560
<20-8,CASTLE>他甚至没提议让你入股合伙
<20-8,CASTLE>I mean, he didn't even offer you to be a partner.

353
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
<20-8,CASTLE>这可不像兄弟会做的事啊
<20-8,CASTLE>That doesn't sound very brotherly to me.

354
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,840
<20-9,BRIAN>我和唐尼之间没有隔夜仇的
<20-9,BRIAN>Hey, any beef I had with Donny was short-lived.

355
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,590
<20-9,BRIAN>我们总能尽快和解
<20-9,BRIAN>We hashed it out.

356
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,510
<20-10,CASTLE>这么说你现在不过是从他那儿偷东西而已
<20-10,CASTLE>So now you're just stealing from him.

357
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,070
<20-11,BRIAN>-什么  -什么
<20-11,BRIAN>- What?  - What?

358
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,570
<20-12,BECKETT>一不小心看穿了你的小把戏  布莱恩
<20-12,BECKETT>Couldn't help but notice your trick with the fruit, Brian.

359
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,830
<20-13,CASTLE>你假装在收酒钱
<20-13,CASTLE>You pretend to ring up a drink,

360
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,680
<20-13,CASTLE>把钱放到收银箱里面  暗中却
<20-13,CASTLE>you stuff the money in the till, and you keep track of it

361
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,950
<20-13,CASTLE>把水果扔进清洗槽里  以此来记录钱的数目
<20-13,CASTLE>by throwing pieces of fruit into the sink.

362
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,170
<20-13,CASTLE>樱桃代表10美元  清柠代表20美元吗
<20-13,CASTLE>Cherries are $10. Limes, what, $20?

363
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,600
<20-13,CASTLE>到下班的时候  清点下水果数
<20-13,CASTLE>At night's end, you tally up your fruit so you know how much

364
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,200
<20-13,CASTLE>就知道该拿多少小费了
<20-13,CASTLE>to put into your tip cup before you lock the register.

365
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,390
<20-13,CASTLE>到底发生了什么呢  布莱恩
<20-13,CASTLE>So what happened, Brian?

366
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,800
<20-13,CASTLE>是被唐尼抓现行了吗
<20-13,CASTLE>Donny catch you stealing?

367
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,180
<20-13,CASTLE>然后一场恶战不可避免
<20-13,CASTLE>Things get physical?

368
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,920
<20-14,BRIAN>就为了那三四十美元吗
<20-14,BRIAN>Over an extra 30 or 40 bucks?

369
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,970
<20-14,BRIAN>那不叫偷  是赚点油水  唐尼很大度的
<20-14,BRIAN>That's not even stealing. It's skimming. Donny understood.

370
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,980
<20-15,BECKETT>店主很大度吗
<20-15,BECKETT>The owner understood?

371
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,390
<20-16,BRIAN>我们像一家人一样  很长时间了
<20-16,BRIAN>We'd all been family long enough.

372
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,980
<20-16,BRIAN>唐尼知道我有时候为了钱交房租
<20-16,BRIAN>Donny knew I had to get creative to make my rent

373
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,790
<20-16,BRIAN>会搞点小手段
<20-16,BRIAN>once in a while.

374
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,660
<20-17,BECKETT>我想看下他的办公室
<20-17,BECKETT>I'd like to see his office.

375
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,700
<20-18,BRIAN>可以  在地下室
<20-18,BRIAN>Sure. It's in the basement.

376
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,390
<20-19,CASTLE>地下室
<20-19,CASTLE>The basement?

377
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,140
<20-20,CASTLE>我从来没看到过
<20-20,CASTLE>I've never seen this.

378
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,100
<20-21,BRIAN>在98年洪水之前都没人知道这个地方
<20-21,BRIAN>No one knew it was there until the flood of '98.

379
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,390
<20-21,BRIAN>比利·皮特掀开油毯
<20-21,BRIAN>Billy Pitt pulled up the old linoleum,

380
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,800
<20-21,BRIAN>才发现了它
<20-21,BRIAN>and there it was.

381
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,110
<20-22,CASTLE>秘密地下室
<20-22,CASTLE>A hidden basement.

382
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,790
<20-22,CASTLE>这可太酷了
<20-22,CASTLE>How cool is this?

383
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,610
<21-1,CASTLE>我刚说的"酷"吗
<21-1,CASTLE>Did I say "Cool"?

384
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,370
<21-1,CASTLE>应该说是"令人惊叹"
<21-1,CASTLE>Make that awesome.

385
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,360
<21-1,CASTLE>谋杀的绝好地点
<21-1,CASTLE>The perfect place for a murder.

386
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,620
<21-1,CASTLE>没人能听到呼救声
<21-1,CASTLE>No one can hear you scream.

387
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,820
<21-2,BECKETT>但也没人能帮忙搬尸体
<21-2,BECKETT>No one can help you carry the body up the stairs either.

388
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,870
<21-3,CASTLE>也许是有人拿枪一直押着唐尼
<21-3,CASTLE>Maybe somebody marched Donny at gunpoint

389
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,660
<21-3,CASTLE>到了河边  在那儿才杀了他
<21-3,CASTLE>down to the river, killed him there.

390
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,150
<21-4,BECKETT>若凶手有枪的话  为什么还用瓶子呢
<21-4,BECKETT>If the killer had a gun, why would he use a bottle?

391
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,440
<21-5,CASTLE>别拿逻辑来分析我的故事
<21-5,CASTLE>Don't ruin my story with your logic.

392
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,250
<21-6,BECKETT>刚刚漆过的油漆味儿
<21-6,BECKETT>It smells like fresh paint.

393
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,740
<21-7,BRIAN>是的   唐尼花了很多时间
<21-7,BRIAN>Yeah, Donny had been putting in a lot of work

394
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,650
<21-7,BRIAN>来打点这里  装了新黄铜栏杆
<21-7,BRIAN>to fix the place up-- new brass rail,

395
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,410
<21-7,BRIAN>翻新酒吧的木板
<21-7,BRIAN>refurbished wood on the bar.

396
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,720
<21-8,CASTLE>发现什么了吗
<21-8,CASTLE>You find something?

397
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,590
<21-9,BECKETT>这儿有铅弹弹洞
<21-9,BECKETT>These are buckshot holes.

398
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,890
<21-10,BECKETT>你有猎枪吗  布莱恩
<21-10,BECKETT>You own a shotgun, Brian?

399
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,530
<21-11,BRIAN>-没有  -鉴证组会对这里进行仔细检查
<21-11,BRIAN>- No. - CSU's gonna comb this place from top to bottom--

400
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,310
<21-12,BECKETT>血迹  铅弹  碎红色玻璃
<21-12,BECKETT>Blood, buckshot, broken red glass.

401
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,250
<21-12,BECKETT>-如果你知道些什么的话  -听我说
<21-12,BECKETT>- So if you have something to say--  - Look,

402
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,870
<21-13,BRIAN>若有人在这里开猎枪的话
<21-13,BRIAN>if a shotgun was fired down here,

403
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,710
<21-13,BRIAN>酒吧所有的人都会知道
<21-13,BRIAN>everybody in the bar would know about it.

404
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
<21-14,CASTLE>打烊之后呢
<21-14,CASTLE>Not if it was after hours.

405
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,350
<21-15,BECKETT>我是说两到三星期前
<21-15,BECKETT>We're talking about two or three weeks ago.

406
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,710
<21-15,BECKETT>那时候唐尼和谁有过过节吗
<21-15,BECKETT>Did Donny have a beef with anyone then?

407
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,900
<21-16,BRIAN>你说两星期前
<21-16,BRIAN>You said two weeks ago?

408
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,860
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>是的
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>Uh, yeah.

409
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,980
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>两星期前  我正在收拾准备下班
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>It was a couple of weeks ago. I was, uh, closing up alone.

410
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,330
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>我把钱拿到地下室保险箱放好
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>I had just done my cash drop down in the basement safe,

411
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,590
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>刚一上来  就听到有人在敲门
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>and I came up, and some guy was knocking on the door--

412
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,890
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>是皮卡皮特
<22-1,ANNIE SWIFT>Pick-up Pete.

413
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,930
<22-2,CASTLE>"搭讪"皮特  因为他喜欢受女性欢迎吗
<22-2,CASTLE>"Pick-up Pete"? Big hit with the ladies?

415
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,670
<22-3,ANNIE>不是  他开一辆皮卡
<22-3,ANNIE>No. He drives a pickup.

416
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,850
<22-5,BECKETT>闹事鬼
<22-5,BECKETT>Gun rack?

417
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,060
<22-6,ANNIE>是的  一个乡巴佬常客
<22-6,ANNIE>Yeah. Regular upstate redneck.

418
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,740
<22-6,ANNIE>总之  他说把钱包忘在隔间了
<22-6,ANNIE>Anyway, he said that he dropped his wallet in the booth,

419
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,860
<22-6,ANNIE>我就让他进来了
<22-6,ANNIE>So I let him in.

420
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,640
<22-6,ANNIE>结果呢  他对我动手动脚的
<22-6,ANNIE>Next thing you know, he's got his hands all over me.

421
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,720
<22-6,ANNIE>他把我压向吧台  突然
<22-6,ANNIE>He's pushing me against the bar. All of a sudden,

422
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,970
<22-6,ANNIE>地下室的门开了
<22-6,ANNIE>the basement door pops open,

423
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,370
<22-6,ANNIE>唐尼走了出来  像海明威的鬼魂一样
<22-6,ANNIE>and here comes Donny, like Hemingway's ghost.

424
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,550
<22-6,ANNIE>估计是我之前没看到他
<22-6,ANNIE>Guess I missed him down there,

425
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,730
<22-6,ANNIE>不过我很高兴他出现了
<22-6,ANNIE>but I'm glad he showed up when he did.

426
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,150
<22-6,ANNIE>他拿了根棒球棒  把皮特赶出去了
<22-6,ANNIE>He grabbed a baseball bat, chased Pete out.

427
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,970
<22-6,ANNIE>在那混蛋开车离开之前
<22-6,ANNIE>He smashed his taillights,

428
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,760
<22-6,ANNIE>他打烂了他的尾灯
<22-6,ANNIE>put a few dents in the pickup for good measure

429
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,540
<22-6,ANNIE>还把车身打了几个凹痕
<22-6,ANNIE>before the jackass could drive off.

430
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,800
<22-6,ANNIE>唐尼让我回家  并忘了这事儿
<22-6,ANNIE>Donny told me to go home and to forget about it.

431
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,430
<22-6,ANNIE>他说皮特永远也来不了这个酒吧了
<22-6,ANNIE>He said that Pete was eighty-sixed for life.

432
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,410
<22-6,ANNIE>自那以后我们再没谈过那件事了
<22-6,ANNIE>That was the last time we talked about it

433
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,160
<22-7,BECKETT>直到昨天晚上
<22-7,BECKETT>until last night.

434
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,070
<22-7,BECKETT>-昨晚发生了什么  -皮特又来了
<22-7,BECKETT>- And what happened last night?  - Pete showed up again.

435
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,350
<22-8,ANNIE>唐尼忍无可忍  直接把他赶了出去
<22-8,ANNIE>Donny wasn't having any of it. He just threw that trash out.

436
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,160
<22-8,ANNIE>还说再有下次
<22-8,ANNIE>Said the next time,

437
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,550
<22-8,ANNIE>挨打的就不是那辆车了
<22-8,ANNIE>it wouldn't be the truck he used the bat on.

438
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,840
<22-9,BECKETT>也就是说唐尼给皮特下了禁令
<22-9,BECKETT>So Donny eighty-sixed Pete for life.

439
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,730
<22-10,CASTLE>而皮特则来了个"礼尚往来"
<22-10,CASTLE>Looks like Pete returned the favor.

440
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,790
<23-1,BECKETT>皮卡皮特  又叫皮特·穆夏
<23-1,BECKETT>Pick-up Pete, A.K.A. Pete Mucha.

441
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,290
<23-1,BECKETT>有几项被驳回的家庭暴力指控
<23-1,BECKETT>He's got a couple of dismissed domestic assault charges

442
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,330
<23-1,BECKETT>而且还是一把
<23-1,BECKETT>and he is also the proud owner

443
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,550
<23-1,BECKETT>雷明顿870猎枪的所有者
<23-1,BECKETT>of a remington 870 shotgun.

444
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,730
<23-1,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托正带他过来呢
<23-1,BECKETT>And Ryan and Esposito are bringing him in now.

445
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,180
<23-2,CASTLE>你觉得"卡塞骏马"这名字怎么样
<23-2,CASTLE>What do you think of "The Castillion"?

447
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:27,410
<23-3,BECKETT>干什么的
<23-3,BECKETT>For?

448
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,870
<23-4,CASTLE>"老地方"刚好提醒了我
<23-4,CASTLE>Well, the Old Haunt just reminded me

449
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,690
<23-4,CASTLE>酒馆文化对这个城市有着多么重大的意义
<23-4,CASTLE>of how vital tavern culture is in this town.

450
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,280
<23-4,CASTLE>我想  何不自己开个酒馆呢
<23-4,CASTLE>I thought, why not open up a little tavern of my own?

451
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,970
<23-5,BECKETT>你是说现成的酒吧不去
<23-5,BECKETT>So instead of buying a drink,

452
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,000
<23-5,BECKETT>非要买下一个才甘心
<23-5,BECKETT>you're gonna buy a whole bar?

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,330
<23-6,CASTLE>这是我回报的方式
<23-6,CASTLE>My way of giving back.

454
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,940
<23-7,BECKETT>-是啊  回报给你的自负还差不多  -"自负吧"
<23-7,BECKETT>- Yeah, to your ego. - "The ego."

455
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,420
<23-9,PETE MUCHA>快报警
<23-9,PETE MUCHA>Someone call the police!

456
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,220
<23-10,PETE>放开我  我挺好的
<23-10,PETE>Let me go. I'm perfectly fine!

457
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:49,830
<23-11,BECKETT>我猜他是皮卡皮特
<23-11,BECKETT>Pick-up Pete, I take it.

458
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,410
<23-12,ESPOSITO>是的  我发现他在市中心的酒吧被踢了出来
<23-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we found him getting tossed out of a bar uptown.

459
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,940
<23-13,RYAN>还有  跟他车里的猎枪一样
<23-13,RYAN>And, uh, just like the shotgun in his truck,

460
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,380
<23-13,RYAN>他喝醉了[loaded还有上膛的意思]
<23-13,RYAN>he's a little loaded.

461
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,120
<23-14,BECKETT>也许谋杀的指控能让他清醒清醒
<23-14,BECKETT>Well, maybe a murder charge will sober him up.

462
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,920
<23-15,RYAN>是啊  来吧
<23-15,RYAN>Yeah. Come on.

463
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,560
<23-16,CASTLE>"城堡"[卡塞尔的名字有城堡的意思]
<23-16,CASTLE>"The Castle."

464
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,070
<23-16,CASTLE>刚好可以弄个小吊桥  踏着走进酒吧
<23-16,CASTLE>It'll just have a wee drawbridge to let you in.

465
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,620
<24-1,RYAN>恭喜你  皮特
<24-1,RYAN>Congratulations, Pete.

466
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,540
<24-1,RYAN>你是我们今年最烂醉如泥的谋杀嫌疑犯
<24-1,RYAN>You're our drunkest murder suspect this year,

467

<24-1,RYAN>- and that includes St. Patrick's day. - What did I win?

469
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,530
<24-3,ESPOSITO>-看你的表现了  皮特  -你知道我叫什么
<24-3,ESPOSITO>- Well, that depends on you, Pete. - You know my name.

470
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,270
<24-4,PETE>你刚刚提到"谋杀"了吗
<24-4,PETE>And did you just say "Murder"?

471
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,980
<24-5,ESPOSITO>你的驾照上注明你住在科克兰
<24-5,ESPOSITO>Your driver's license says you're from up in Cortland.

472
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,050
<24-5,ESPOSITO>怎么  那里没有酒吧吗
<24-5,ESPOSITO>What, they don't have any bars up there,

473
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,670
<24-5,ESPOSITO>还是你在那的酒吧也被人下了禁令
<24-5,ESPOSITO>or did you get eighty-sixed from them, too?

474
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,870
<24-6,PETE>城里是我工作的地方
<24-6,PETE>The city's where I work,

475
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,510
<24-6,PETE>铺预制墙板啊  铺管道啊
<24-6,PETE>you know, like drywall, like pipe setting.

476
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,210
<24-6,PETE>我在下班之后管道铺的最好了[暗指性交]
<24-6,PETE>And I do some of my best pipe laying after work,

477
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,540
<24-6,PETE>你们懂的
<24-6,PETE>if you know what I mean.

478
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,460
<24-7,ESPOSITO>你拥有一把猎枪  皮特
<24-7,ESPOSITO>You own a shotgun, Pete.

479
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,290
<24-8,ESPOSITO>你喜欢打猎  是吗
<24-8,ESPOSITO>You like hunting, do you?

480
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,710
<24-8,ESPOSITO>等等
<24-8,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute.

481
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,200
<24-9,PETE>你们因为我打死一只鹿说我谋杀吗
<24-9,PETE>You after me for murdering a 2-point buck?

482
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,130
<24-10,RYAN>不是  我们是因为你两周前
<24-10,RYAN>Nah. We're after you for your little dust up

483
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,670
<24-10,RYAN>在"老地方"那闹事抓你
<24-10,RYAN>at the old haunt two weeks ago.

484
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,100
<24-11,PETE>"老地方"  我昨晚就在那啊
<24-11,PETE>The old haunt! That's where I was last night.

485
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,240
<24-11,PETE>唐尼就因为那个婊子酒保
<24-11,PETE>Donny wouldn't let me in

486
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,820
<24-11,PETE>不让我进去
<24-11,PETE>because of that bitch bartender.

487
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,300
<24-11,PETE>我要声明一下  是她主动勾搭我的
<24-11,PETE>For the record, she came on to me.

488
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,030
<24-12,RYAN>那就是你回到那里  杀死他的原因吗
<24-12,RYAN>That why you came back and you killed him,

489
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,970
<24-12,RYAN>因为你喝醉了  暴怒
<24-12,RYAN>'cause you were drunk and angry,

490
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,100
<24-12,RYAN>他不让你进去吗
<24-12,RYAN>and he wouldn't let you in?

491
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,570
<24-13,PETE>唐尼死了
<24-13,PETE>Donny's dead?

492
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,870
<24-14,ESPOSITO>你昨晚到底干了什么  皮特
<24-14,ESPOSITO>What'd you really do last night, Pete?

493
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,020
<24-14,ESPOSITO>喂  等等
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Whoa! Hey!

494
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,330
<24-15,PETE>我杀他干什么
<24-15,PETE>Why would I kill the guy?

495
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,460
<24-16,ESPOSITO>因为他把你的车砸坏了
<24-16,ESPOSITO>Maybe because he trashed your truck.

496
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,980
<24-17,RYAN>而且你上次拿着猎枪向他射击的时候
<24-17,RYAN>And you were too drunk to shoot straight

497
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,690
<24-17,RYAN>你酒喝得太多  根本就没发准确的打中他
<24-17,RYAN>the last time you came after him with a shotgun.

498
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,940
<24-17,RYAN>猎枪
<24-17,RYAN>Shotgun?

499
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,170
<24-18,PETE>听着  他的确砸坏了我的车  那又如何
<24-18,PETE>Look, he trashed my truck. So what?

500
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,700
<24-18,PETE>他付的钱比车造成的损毁多得多
<24-18,PETE>He more than paid for the damages.

501
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,390
<24-19,ESPOSITO>他干什么了
<24-19,ESPOSITO>He what now?

502
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,670
<24-20,PETE>在他砸坏我的车之后  我就要报警
<24-20,PETE>After he pounded my truck, I started calling the cops.

503
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,780
<24-20,PETE>他立马就冷静了下来  拿出厚厚一沓钱
<24-20,PETE>Well, he calmed down real fast, and out came this fat wad,

504
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,170
<24-20,PETE>从里面拿出了一千美元  一点都不心疼
<24-20,PETE>and he peeled off a cool grand like it was nothin'.

505
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,340
<24-21,ESPOSITO>唐尼...给了你一千美元
<24-21,ESPOSITO>Donny... gave you $1,000?

506
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,850
<24-22,PETE>他还有好多呢
<24-22,PETE>He had plenty more.

507
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,630
<24-22,PETE>我问他"你中彩票了吗"
<24-22,PETE>I asked him, "What, did you score lotto?"

508
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,580
<24-22,PETE>他回答说"差不多吧"
<24-22,PETE>And he was all like, "Yeah, sorta."

509
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,090
<24-22,PETE>你可以问问给我修车的那个人
<24-22,PETE>You can ask my repair guy.

510
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,970
<24-22,PETE>我用唐尼给我的现金付的帐
<24-22,PETE>I paid with Donny's cash.

511
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,730
<24-23,RYAN>坐着别动  我去打个电话
<24-23,RYAN>Don't go anywhere. I'm gonna make a call.

512
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,030
<24-24,PETE>别急  我们会抓到他的
<24-24,PETE>Don't worry. We're gonna get this guy.

513
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,820
<25-1,RYAN>皮特的不在场证明成立
<25-1,RYAN>Pete's alibi holds.

514
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,910
<25-1,RYAN>他在穆雷山
<25-1,RYAN>He was sleeping it off

515
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,730
<25-1,RYAN>一个朋友家睡大觉
<25-1,RYAN>at a friend's apartment over in Murray Hill.

516
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,780
<25-2,ESPOSITO>奇怪的是  银行账户只剩六元二十三美分的人
<25-2,ESPOSITO>It's weird that a guy who had only $6.23 in his bank account

517
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,760
<25-2,ESPOSITO>竟然可以毫不犹豫的拿出一千美元
<25-2,ESPOSITO>had enough cash on hand to peel off a "G" like it was nothing.

518
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,590
<25-3,RYAN>更别提酒吧的那些装修费用了
<25-3,RYAN>Not to mention all the repairs he made to the bar.

519
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,690
<25-4,BECKETT>也许他也在揩油
<25-4,BECKETT>Maybe he was skimming, too.

520
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,970
<25-5,CASTLE>如果他揩油揩到那种程度
<25-5,CASTLE>If he was skimming that much,

521
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,850
<25-5,CASTLE>他肯定会欠某人钱的
<25-5,CASTLE>there'd have to be someone he wasn't paying--

522
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,120
<25-5,CASTLE>供货商或是经销商
<25-5,CASTLE>A supplier, distributor?

523
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,370
<25-6,BECKETT>你们再去一趟"老地方"
<25-6,BECKETT>Why don't you guys go back to the old haunt

524
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,810
<25-6,BECKETT>查查唐尼的账簿
<25-6,BECKETT>and take a look at Donny's ledgers?

525
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,270
<25-6,BECKETT>找找那笔钱是从哪来的
<25-6,BECKETT>Let's find out where that money was coming from.

526
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,250
<25-7,UNIFORM>给你  探长
<25-7,UNIFORM>Here you go, Detective.

527
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,540
<25-7,UNIFORM>谢谢
<25-7,UNIFORM>Thank you.

528
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,380
<25-8,BECKETT>鉴证组检查了酒吧和地下室
<25-8,BECKETT>So CSU processed that bar and basement,

529
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,520
<25-8,BECKETT>没有找到任何破碎的红色玻璃
<25-8,BECKETT>and there's no indication of any broken red glass.

530
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,010
<25-8,BECKETT>而找到的唯一的血迹是在铅弹上
<25-8,BECKETT>And the only blood they found was under the buckshot.

531
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,050
<25-9,CASTLE>这么说那里不是凶案现场
<25-9,CASTLE>So it wasn't our murder scene.

532
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,470
<25-10,BECKETT>看起来唐尼离开酒吧的时候还活着
<25-10,BECKETT>Well, looks like Donny left that bar alive.

533
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,200
<25-10,BECKETT>有一点我不明白
<25-10,BECKETT>You know, I don't get it.

534
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,130
<26-1,RYAN>如果唐尼在这里被击中
<26-1,RYAN>If Donny got shot down here,

536
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,900
<26-1,RYAN>他又没干坏事
<26-1,RYAN>and he didn't do anything wrong,

537
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,130
<26-1,RYAN>为什么不报警呢
<26-1,RYAN>Why didn't he report it?

538
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,940
<26-2,ESPOSITO>新开张酒吧的业主最不希望的
<26-2,ESPOSITO>The last thing any new bar owner wants

539
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,060
<26-2,ESPOSITO>就是和条子有瓜葛
<26-2,ESPOSITO>is trouble with the cops.

540
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,710
<26-2,ESPOSITO>就算是一起意外枪击事件
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Even an accidental shooting on the premises

541
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,900
<26-2,ESPOSITO>都会使唐尼丢掉卖酒的执照
<26-2,ESPOSITO>could've cost Donny his liquor license for good.

542
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,290
<26-3,RYAN>也许是因为这个原因
<26-3,RYAN>Oh, probably why he shelled out

543
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,000
<26-3,RYAN>-他才和皮特私了  -看不出来哪来的钱
<26-3,RYAN>- for pete's truck damage, too.  - I don't see how.

544
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,350
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>不光他的个人银行账户岌岌可危
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>His personal account isn't the only thing that's tapped out.

545
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,300
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>"老地方"勉强维持收支平衡
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>The old haunt was barely breaking even,

546
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,840
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>大多数时间是亏本经营
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>Operating at a loss most days.

547
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,110
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>他根本就不可能随便拿出钱来的
<26-4,ESPSOTIO>There's no way he was throwing money around.

548
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,620
<26-5,RYAN>但是他还是有钱的  这有发票
<26-5,RYAN>Yet, he was. I've got invoices here--

549
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,070
<26-5,RYAN>一张是黄铜栏杆
<26-5,RYAN>one for the new brass rail

550
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,340
<26-5,RYAN>还有一张是给酒吧新换的木板
<26-5,RYAN>and one for the new wood for the bar,

551
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,100
<26-5,RYAN>每张发票的价格都接近六千美元
<26-5,RYAN>Each totaling close to 6 grand.

552
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,590
<26-5,RYAN>两张都盖了"现金付款"和"已付全款"
<26-5,RYAN>Both of 'em are stamped "Petty cash. Paid in full."

553
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,880
<26-6,ESPOSITO>真是出手大方啊
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Nothing petty about that.

554
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,340
<26-7,RYAN>你确定那里面没有提到中彩票吗
<26-7,RYAN>You sure there's nothing in there about him winning the lotto?

555
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,380
<26-8,ESPOSITO>事实上
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Actually...

556
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,560
<26-8,ESPOSITO>还真有
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe there is.

557
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,290
<27-1,BECKETT>一张海根&格瑞姆拍卖行的寄售收据
<27-1,BECKETT>A consignment receipt from Hagen & Graham auction house?

558
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,290
<27-2,CASTLE>像唐尼这样的人怎么会和
<27-2,CASTLE>Why is a guy like Donny doing business

559
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,490
<27-2,CASTLE>卖毕加索和伦勃朗作品的地方扯上关系
<27-2,CASTLE>with a place that sells Picassos and rembrandts?

560
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,060
<27-3,RYAN>他的生意勉强维持收支平衡
<27-3,RYAN>His business was barely breaking even.

561
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,500
<27-3,RYAN>他马上就要失去一切了
<27-3,RYAN>He was on the verge of losing everything.

562
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,610
<27-4,ESPOSITO>工会卡也卖掉了
<27-4,ESPOSITO>And with his union card gone,

563
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,450
<27-4,ESPOSITO>看起来他又找到了其他的东西可卖
<27-4,ESPOSITO>It looks like he found something else to sell.

564
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,860
<27-5,CASTLE>是什么呢
<27-5,CASTLE>Yeah, but what?

565
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,810
<27-5,CASTLE>一个码头工人能有什么值钱的东西
<27-5,CASTLE>What does a dock worker have that's valuable enough for

566
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,820
<27-5,CASTLE>能够引起海根&格瑞姆拍卖行的兴趣呢
<27-5,CASTLE>a place like Hagen & Graham's to be interested?

568
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,430
<27-6,BECKETT>也许是不属于他的东西
<27-6,BECKETT>Maybe something that wasn't his.

569
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,270
<28-1,CASTLE>应该有个地方歌颂历史  推崇工艺
<28-1,CASTLE>Now here's a place that honors history and values craftsmanship.

570
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,690
<28-2,BECKETT>你对这些保留历史什么的很感兴趣  是吧
<28-2,BECKETT>You're pretty into this whole preserving history stuff, huh?

571
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,540
<28-3,CASTLE>只不过是最近我发现有些事情改变了
<28-3,CASTLE>I think just lately, I've been noticing the changes.

572
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,810
<28-4,BECKETT>你是说阿丽克西斯的哥特风朋友吗
<28-4,BECKETT>You mean in Alexis' goth friend?

573
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,020
<28-5,CASTLE>不  我是在想时代广场那个区域
<28-5,CASTLE>No, I was thinking more along the lines of times square.

574
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,510
<28-5,CASTLE>知道吗  那里曾经渗透着真正纽约的风情和质感
<28-5,CASTLE>You know, once it had a real New York grit and character.

575
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,280
<28-5,CASTLE>现在那个地方应该叫做时代广场那疙瘩
<28-5,CASTLE>And now they should just call it times square land.

576
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,810
<28-6,STEVEN HEISLER>很抱歉让你们久等
<28-6,STEVEN HEISLER>So sorry to have kept you waiting.

<28-7,BECKETT>I'm Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle.

579
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,290
<28-7,BECKETT>我们想问问
<28-7,BECKETT>We were wondering

580
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,990
<28-7,BECKETT>-你是否记得这个人  -是的  唐纳德·海耶斯
<28-7,BECKETT>- if you recognize this man.  - Oh, yes. Donald Hayes.

581
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,490
<28-8,HEISLER>你想象的到  通常没有码头工人光顾这里
<28-8,HEISLER>We don't get many dock workers here, as you might imagine.

582
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,960
<28-9,BECKETT>有什么事
<28-9,BECKETT>What's this about?

583
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,550
<28-10,HEISLER>-他被谋杀了  -谋杀了  老天
<28-10,HEISLER>- He was murdered.  - Murdered? Good lord.

584
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,130
<28-11,BECKETT>我们了解到他拿了一个物品到这里拍卖
<28-11,BECKETT>We understand that he put an item up here for auction.

585
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:40,280
<28-11,BECKETT>我们想知道那是什么
<28-11,BECKETT>We were wondering what it was.

586
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,460
<28-12,HEISLER>你们认识一个叫做吉米·沃克的人吗
<28-12,HEISLER>Are you familiar with a man by the name of Jimmy Walker?

587
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,910
<28-13,CASTLE>当然  地球人都知道吉米·沃克[很多人叫这个名字]
<28-13,CASTLE>Sure. Everybody knows Jimmy Walker.

588
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,310
<28-14,HEISLER>不  不是在《欢乐时光》演小杰那个
<28-14,HEISLER>No, not the actor who played JJ on "Good times."

589
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,000
<28-15,CASTLE>当然不是  你说的是纽约的前任市长
<28-15,CASTLE>No, the former mayor of New York.

590
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,050
<28-15,CASTLE>1926年当选
<28-15,CASTLE>Took office 1926,

<28-15,CASTLE>昵称叫做"美男詹姆斯"
<28-15,CASTLE>went by the nickname "Beau James,"

592
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,000
<28-15,CASTLE>是个出了名的腐败政府官员  花花公子
<28-15,CASTLE>famous for being a corrupt politician, renowned womanizer,

593
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,250
<28-15,CASTLE>而且公开反对禁酒令
<28-15,CASTLE>and also openly defiant of prohibition.

594
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,190
<28-16,HEISLER>这么说  你的确知道他
<28-16,HEISLER>Ah. So you do know him.

595
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,100
<28-17,BECKETT>前任市长和我们的案子有什么关系
<28-17,BECKETT>What does the former mayor have to do with this?

596
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,110
<28-18,HEISLER>唐纳德拥有一件原本属于前任市长的东西
<28-18,HEISLER>Donald had an item that once belonged to him.

597
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,230
<28-18,HEISLER>是这样  传言说沃克市长
<28-18,HEISLER>You see, Mayor Walker was rumored

598
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,790
<28-18,HEISLER>拥有私人的酒品收藏  被认为
<28-18,HEISLER>to have had a private liquor collection thought to contain

599
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,410
<28-18,HEISLER>是蒸馏出来的最上等的威士忌
<28-18,HEISLER>one of the finest whiskeys ever distilled.

600
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,560
<28-19,CASTLE>当联邦特工把沃克赶出办公室时候
<28-19,CASTLE>Unceremoniously dumped into the sewers

601
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,510
<28-19,CASTLE>酒被随意的丢进了下水道
<28-19,CASTLE>when federal agents ran Walker out of office.

602
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,230
<28-20,HEISLER>唐纳德带着唯一幸存的酒 过来
<28-20,HEISLER>Donald came in with the sole surviving bottle--

<28-21,HEISLER>一八七五年的圣米里亚姆  极品威士忌
<28-21,HEISLER>an 1875 St. Miriam, rock of Scotland.

604
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,330
<28-21,HEISLER>我一看见蜡封上压印的J.W
<28-21,HEISLER>I knew what it was the moment I saw

605
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,660
<28-21,HEISLER>就知道这是什么了
<28-21,HEISLER>the "J.W" Pressed into its wax seal.

606
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,610
<28-22,CASTLE>一八七五年的圣米里亚姆
<28-22,CASTLE>An 1875 St. Miriam--

607
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,910
<28-22,CASTLE>这相当于威士忌中的圣杯
<28-22,CASTLE>that is the holy grail of scotches.

608
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,840
<28-22,CASTLE>只要能尝一口  我什么都肯做
<28-22,CASTLE>I would kill for just a taste of that.

609
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,580
<28-23,BECKETT>你有那瓶酒的照片吗
<28-23,BECKETT>Do you have a picture of this bottle of scotch?

610
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,790
<29-1,CASTLE>唐尼在哪里弄到这个的
<29-1,CASTLE>Where did Donny get it?

<29-2,HEISLER>他的爷爷里奥留给他的
<29-2,HEISLER>Left to him by his grandfather Leo,

612
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,950
<29-2,HEISLER>很显然这是他从第二次世界大战
<29-2,HEISLER>who apparently was given it as a gift

613
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,850
<29-2,HEISLER>回来时收到的礼物
<29-2,HEISLER>when he returned from world war ii.

<29-4,BECKETT>And where is that bottle now?

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,980
<29-5,HEISLER>它以两万六千美金
<29-5,HEISLER>It was sold for $26,000

<29-7,CASTLE>真是个非常昂贵的凶器啊
<29-7,CASTLE>That is one expensive murder weapon.

621
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,150
<30-1,CASTLE>你说这家伙是怎么起家的
<30-1,CASTLE>How did you say this guy made his millions?

<30-3,CASTLE>这家伙肯花两万六千美金买一瓶威士忌
<30-3,CASTLE>The guy spent 26k on a bottle of whiskey.

624
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,990
<30-3,CASTLE>他理应买个更像样的房子啊
<30-3,CASTLE>He could treat himself to nicer digs.

625
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,250
<30-5,BECKETT>-他有什么动机  -我只知道
<30-5,BECKETT>- What's his motivation?  - All I know is that

626
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,910
<30-5,BECKETT>这是关于那具被弃河的尸体
<30-5,BECKETT>this is about a body's throw away from the river.

627
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,030
<30-6,JEFFERY MCGUIGAN>斯皮蒂·旺科臭小子
<30-6,JEFFERY MCGUIGAN>Speedy Wok my ass.

628
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,060
<30-6,JEFFERY MCGUIGAN>你不是斯皮蒂·旺科
<30-6,JEFFERY MCGUIGAN>You're not even Speedy Wok.

629
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,870
<30-7,BECKETT>我们来这里是为了一件在海根&格瑞姆拍卖行
<30-7,BECKETT>We're here about a purchase that was made

630
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,920
<30-7,BECKETT>被购买的物品
<30-7,BECKETT>at Hagen & Graham's.

631
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,770
<30-7,BECKETT>杰夫瑞·麦奎根在这里吗
<30-7,BECKETT>Is there a Jeffrey Mcguigan here?

632
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,740
<30-8,JEFFERY>叫我麦古  这是我出来混的名字  懂吗
<30-8,JEFFERY>I go by Magoo. It's my street name, you know?

633
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,590
<30-9,CASTLE>-说真的  你就是杰夫瑞·麦奎根  -麦古
<30-9,CASTLE>- Seriously, you're Jeffrey Mcguigan?  - Magoo.

634
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,510
<30-10,JEFFERY>是的  我在那里买了很多垃圾
<30-10,JEFFERY>And yeah, I've purchased a ton of crap at that place.

635
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,450
<30-10,JEFFERY>进来吧
<30-10,JEFFERY>Come on in.

636
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,370
<30-11,CASTLE>我们要找的这个"垃圾"  麦古
<30-11,CASTLE>So this piece of crap we're looking for, Magoo,

637
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,340
<30-11,CASTLE>是一瓶无价的红瓶苏格兰酒
<30-11,CASTLE>Is a priceless red bottle of scotch.

638
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,910
<30-12,JEFFERY>不  有标价的  好吧  但那挺好喝的
<30-12,JEFFERY>No, it had a price, all right. But it was pretty tasty.

639
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,880
<30-13,CASTLE>好喝
<30-13,CASTLE>Tasty?

640
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,080
<30-13,CASTLE>你用"好喝"来形容一瓶一百三十五年的佳酿吗
<30-13,CASTLE>You describe a 135-year-old bottle of scotch as "Tasty"?

641
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,660
<30-14,JEFFERY>我的意思是说混了点麦根啤酒之后挺好喝
<30-14,JEFFERY>I mean, you know, after I mixed in a little rootbeer.

642
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,940
<30-15,BECKETT>好了  麦古  让我们看看那个瓶子
<30-15,BECKETT>Yeah, okay, Magoo, let's see that bottle.

643
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,790
<30-16,JEFFERY>你认真的吗  你就这样随便走进我的家
<30-16,JEFFERY>Seriously? You're just gonna walk into my crib

644
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,360
<30-16,JEFFERY>-然后开始指挥我吗  -看起来不在这里
<30-16,JEFFERY>- and start bossing me around?  - Well, I don't see it here.

645
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,710
<30-17,CASTLE>你不会碰巧将瓶子打破了吧
<30-17,CASTLE>You didn't happen to break the bottle over... something?

646
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,870
<30-18,JEFFERY>你们来到底有什么事  你知道吗
<30-18,JEFFERY>What is this about? You know, I may have

647
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,280
<30-18,JEFFERY>我在公司上市时  我的确从康奈尔大学退了学
<30-18,JEFFERY>dropped out of cornell when my company went public,

648
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,070
<30-18,JEFFERY>但我仍然知道我的权利
<30-18,JEFFERY>but I still know my rights.

649
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,030
<30-19,BECKETT>你购买的那瓶酒
<30-19,BECKETT>That bottle that you purchased

650
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,610
<30-19,BECKETT>有可能被用来当作凶器了
<30-19,BECKETT>might have been used to commit murder.

651
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,590
<30-19,BECKETT>所以除非你想让我宣读你的米兰达权利
<30-19,BECKETT>So unless you want to learn your miranda rights,

652
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,280
<30-19,BECKETT>你最好别拖延时间  找出来给我们看看
<30-19,BECKETT>you better quit stalling and show us where it is.

653
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,790
<30-20,JEFFERY>好的  好的  我没在拖时间
<30-20,JEFFERY>Yeah, okay, cool. I'm not stalling.

654
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,220
<30-21,BECKETT>-很好  -是的
<30-21,BECKETT>- Great.  - Yeah.

655
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,170
<30-23,CASTLE>你要把它丢掉吗
<30-23,CASTLE>You were throwing it out?

656
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,210
<30-24,JEFFERY>在蓝桶里  循环利用
<30-24,JEFFERY>In the blue bucket. I recycle.

657
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,920
<30-25,BECKETT>这仍然完好无损
<30-25,BECKETT>Well, it's still intact.

658
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,490
<30-25,BECKETT>除非是击打时令玻璃碎片掉落
<30-25,BECKETT>Unless a sliver of glass came out when it hit--

659
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,040
<30-26,JEFFERY>伙计  没人打架
<30-26,JEFFERY>Man, nobody hit anybody.

660
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,240
<30-27,CASTLE>是啊  继续将麦根啤酒和上等威士忌
<30-27,CASTLE>Yes, well, keep mixing rootbeer with fine scotch,

661
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,470
<30-27,CASTLE>混在一起喝  我都想扁你了
<30-27,CASTLE>that may change...

662
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,310
<30-28,BECKETT>好了  卡塞尔  走吧
<30-28,BECKETT>Okay, Castle. Let's go.

663
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,560
<30-29,BECKETT>-别说我没提醒你哦  -谢谢
<30-29,BECKETT>- Just so you know.  - Thank you.

664
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,910
<30-30,CASTLE>那白痴的小毛孩根本不配
<30-30,CASTLE>Cretinous little uncultured palate doesn't deserve--

665
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,820
<30-30,CASTLE>你听到他说什么了吗  麦根啤酒
<30-30,CASTLE>did you hear what he said? Rootbeer.

666
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,780
<30-31,CASTLE>要是我年轻个十五岁  我肯定痛扁他
<30-31,CASTLE>If I was 15 years younger, I'd give that kid such a pinch.

667
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,290
<31-1,LANIE>一样的玻璃
<31-1,LANIE>Same glass,

668
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,170
<31-1,LANIE>但唐尼头上的碎片
<31-1,LANIE>but the shard in Donny's head

669
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,900
<31-1,LANIE>太大了  不可能是这个瓶子上的
<31-1,LANIE>is way too big to have come from this bottle.

670
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,960
<31-2,CASTLE>就是说这并不是
<31-2,CASTLE>Which means it can't be

671
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,110
<31-2,CASTLE>世界上仅存的一瓶
<31-2,CASTLE>the only remaining bottle in the world.

672
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,770
<31-3,BECKETT>显然不是
<31-3,BECKETT>Clearly not.

673
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,310
<31-4,CASTLE>这就表示我还有机会尝到这佳酿
<31-4,CASTLE>Which means I still have a shot at getting a taste.

674
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,690
<31-5,BECKETT>就是说唐尼找到了另一瓶酒
<31-5,BECKETT>Which means that Donny came across a second bottle.

675
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,100
<31-6,CASTLE>-没错  在他头上找到了  -好的  那可能里奥
<31-6,CASTLE>- Yeah, upside his head.  - Okay, so maybe leo

676
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,650
<31-7,BECKETT>把酒给了亲戚或者朋友
<31-7,BECKETT>gave a bottle to a relative or a friend,

677
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,010
<31-7,BECKETT>当唐尼发现这瓶酒的价值之后
<31-7,BECKETT>and once Donny learned how much it was worth,

678
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,800
<31-7,BECKETT>他想去找回来
<31-7,BECKETT>he went after it.

679
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,070
<31-8,CASTLE>结果酒没拿到  还赔了性命
<31-8,CASTLE>And got more than he bargained for.

680
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,750
<31-9,BECKETT>我想我得调查一下里奥了
<31-9,BECKETT>I think I'm gonna do a little research on Leo,

681
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,380
<31-9,BECKETT>看看我们能否找到沃克市长
<31-9,BECKETT>see what we can dig up on Mayor Walker

682
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,670
<31-9,BECKETT>和他神秘威士忌的资料
<31-9,BECKETT>and his mystery whiskey.

683
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,280
<31-10,CASTLE>调查
<31-10,CASTLE>Research.

684
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,030
<31-10,CASTLE>我也要调查一下了
<31-10,CASTLE>I'm gonna do that, too.

685
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,400
<31-10,CASTLE>没错
<31-10,CASTLE>Yeah.

687
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,250
<32-1,CASTLE>这叫边车
<32-1,CASTLE>It's called the sidecar--

688
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,360
<32-1,CASTLE>这是禁酒令期间涌现的最好的鸡尾酒
<32-1,CASTLE>one of the best drinks to come out of the prohibition area.

689
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,830
<32-1,CASTLE>那个时候  喝酒意味着要暗中进行
<32-1,CASTLE>A time when getting a drink meant secret doors,

690
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,190
<32-1,CASTLE>还会和帮派和走私酒的人扯上关系
<32-1,CASTLE>gangsters, and bootleggers.

691
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,450
<32-2,MARTHA>噢  里克  我喜欢这个主意
<32-2,MARTHA>Ooh, Rick, I'm loving this idea.

692
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,730
<32-2,MARTHA>你知道  城里真是需要一个怀旧的地方
<32-2,MARTHA>You know, our town could use a throwback joint.

693
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,290
<32-2,MARTHA>噢  想到完美的名字  "里克美国咖啡屋"
<32-2,MARTHA>Ooh, perfect name for it-- "Rick's cafe americain."

694
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,320
<32-3,CASTLE>老妈  这太完美了
<32-3,CASTLE>Mother, that's perfect.

695
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,590
<32-3,CASTLE>我在尝试把自己名字弄到酒吧名字里去
<32-3,CASTLE>I was trying to come up with a bogie reference myself.

696
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,750
<32-3,CASTLE>可我能想出来的只有  卡塞尔布兰卡
<32-3,CASTLE>All I could think of was "Castle-blanca."

697
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,190
<32-3,CASTLE>-我觉得这样太直白了  -没错
<32-3,CASTLE>- I thought it was a little too on the nose. - Yeah.

698
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,150
<32-4,ALEXIS>我需要喝一杯
<32-4,ALEXIS>I need a drink.

699
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,610
<32-4,ALEXIS>水  马蒂尼酒的做法
<32-4,ALEXIS>H2O, dirty.

700
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,020
<32-5,CASTLE>一杯自来水
<32-5,CASTLE>Tap water it is.

701
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,240
<32-6,MARTHA>那么你的暗黑分身去哪了
<32-6,MARTHA>So where's your dark shadow?

702
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,260
<32-7,ALEXIS>她跟一些在纽约时装学院认识的朋友出去了
<32-7,ALEXIS>She went out with some people she met at F.I.T.

703
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,870
<32-7,ALEXIS>没邀请我
<32-7,ALEXIS>I was not invited.

704
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,100
<32-8,CASTLE>我不知道应该高兴还是生气
<32-8,CASTLE>I don't know whether to be delighted or outraged.

705
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,210
<32-9,ALEXIS>我也是  她维护自我意识很强
<32-9,ALEXIS>Me neither. She's really defensive,

706
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,760
<32-9,ALEXIS>而且她拿所有我在乎的事情开玩笑
<32-9,ALEXIS>and she makes fun of everything that's important to me.

707
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,270
<32-9,ALEXIS>我不断寻找往日格雷西的影子
<32-9,ALEXIS>I keep looking for the Gracie I knew,

708
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,230
<32-9,ALEXIS>-但她已经不在了  -那么
<32-9,ALEXIS>- but she's just not there anymore.  - Well,

709
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,670
<32-10,MARTHA>你也不是从前那个女孩了
<32-10,MARTHA>you're not the same girl you were back then either.

710
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,560
<32-10,MARTHA>你知道吗  或者她只是在
<32-10,MARTHA>You know, maybe she's just responding

711
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,850
<32-11,ALEXIS>-对你的变化作出反应  -我没变
<32-11,ALEXIS>- to how you've changed.  - I haven't changed.

712
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,360
<32-12,MARTHA>噢  亲爱的  拜托了  看看你
<32-12,MARTHA>Oh, darling, please. Look at you.

713
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,150
<32-12,MARTHA>你长高了  漂亮  优雅
<32-12,MARTHA>You are tall, beautiful, sophisticated.

714
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,090
<32-12,MARTHA>你有个迷人的奶奶  还有
<32-12,MARTHA>You have a glam gram, and...

715
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,640
<32-12,MARTHA>他  还有个男友
<32-12,MARTHA>him, and a boyfriend.

716
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,510
<32-12,MARTHA>你有想过  这些或许让一个来自堪萨斯州的
<32-12,MARTHA>You know, did it ever occur to you, that might be

717
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,760
<32-12,MARTHA>-女孩感到有些畏惧吗  -畏惧
<32-12,MARTHA>- rather intimidating to a girl from Kansas?  - Intimidated?

718
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,390
<32-13,ALEXIS>当我问她的手套在哪里买的
<32-13,ALEXIS>When I asked where she got her gloves,

719
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,040
<32-13,ALEXIS>她说是在我不会去的地方
<32-13,ALEXIS>she said it was a place I wouldn't go to.

720
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,530
<32-14,MARTHA>你把那话当作是冒犯
<32-14,MARTHA>Now you took that as an affront,

721
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,540
<32-14,MARTHA>但她很可能只是在自贬而已
<32-14,MARTHA>and she was just probably being self-deprecating.

722
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,240
<32-15,CASTLE>我想有人需要一杯无酒精莫吉托[一种鸡尾酒]
<32-15,CASTLE>You know what? I think someone needs a virgin mojito.

723
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,650
<32-15,CASTLE>帮我再拿些薄荷过来  在冰箱里
<32-15,CASTLE>Go grab me some more mint. It's in the fridge.

724
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,630
<32-16,MARTHA>-敬你  孩子  -也敬你
<32-16,MARTHA>- Here's looking at you, kid.  - And you.

725
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,680
<32-18,ALEXIS>你应该事先告诉我你设下了陷阱
<32-18,ALEXIS>You coulda told me you booby-trapped it.

726
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,270
<32-19,CASTLE>是啊  我就是通过这种方法防止政府和黑帮
<32-19,CASTLE>Oh, yes. Well, that's just how I protect my stash

727
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,740
<32-19,CASTLE>发现我的宝物啊
<32-19,CASTLE>from g-men and mobsters.

728
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,610
<32-20,ALEXIS>-至少你得帮我把它们重装进去  -好
<32-20,ALEXIS>- Mm. At least help me reload them.  - Right.

729
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,180
<32-21,CASTLE>重装
<32-21,CASTLE>Reload.

730
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,240
<32-21,CASTLE>重装[有给枪上膛的意思]
<32-21,CASTLE>Reload.

731
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,510
<32-21,CASTLE>贝克特  我想我知道唐尼是怎么中枪的了
<32-21,CASTLE>Beckett, I think I know how Donny was shot.

732
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,770
<33-1,CASTLE>与我一同踏上这看似容易却又危险重重的旅程
<33-1,CASTLE>Take a trip with me to a simple yet dangerous time...

733
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,130
<33-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  鉴证科已经检查过整个地下室了
<33-2,BECKETT>Castle, C.S.U. already swept through this entire basement,

734
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,060
<33-2,BECKETT>我们好不容易拿着笔记本躺在了床上
<33-2,BECKETT>and we were just tucked in with my laptop.

735
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,340
<33-3,CASTLE>我们
<33-3,CASTLE>"We"?

736
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,660
<33-4,BECKETT>乔什和我  他帮我一起调查
<33-4,BECKETT>Josh and I. He was helping me research.

737
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,270
<33-5,CASTLE>总之  那个时候禁酒令是明文法令
<33-5,CASTLE>Anyway, a dangerous time when prohibition was law

738
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,100
<33-5,CASTLE>走私酒的人则是亡命之徒
<33-5,CASTLE>and bootleggers the lawless,

739
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,600
<33-5,CASTLE>通常会采取极端措施
<33-5,CASTLE>often going to extreme measures

740
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,110
<33-5,CASTLE>保护他们的"液体财富"
<33-5,CASTLE>to protect their liquid treasure.

741
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,330
<33-6,BECKETT>-你能说重点吗  -好的
<33-6,BECKETT>- Can you get to the point?  - Yes.

742
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,600
<33-7,CASTLE>你还记得唐尼突然跳出来
<33-7,CASTLE>You remember when Donny jumped up

743
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,990
<33-7,CASTLE>从皮卡皮特手中救了安妮吗
<33-7,CASTLE>and rescued Annie from pick-up Pete?

744
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,440
<33-7,CASTLE>她说她把钱放到地下室保险箱的时候
<33-7,CASTLE>She said she completely missed him

745
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,820
<33-7,CASTLE>完全没有发现他在这
<33-7,CASTLE>when she was down here doing her safe drop.

746
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,870
<33-8,BECKETT>当时很晚  她很疲惫
<33-8,BECKETT>It was late. She was tired.

747
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,360
<33-8,BECKETT>我知道她的感受
<33-8,BECKETT>I can relate.

748
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,700
<33-9,CASTLE>也许他根本就不在那里
<33-9,CASTLE>Or maybe he wasn't down here at all.

749
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,330
<33-9,CASTLE>被铅弹击中的墙
<33-9,CASTLE>Buckshot wall...

750
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,580
<33-9,CASTLE>正对面的墙
<33-9,CASTLE>Wall directly opposite.

751
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,130
<33-9,CASTLE>帮我移一下柜子
<33-9,CASTLE>Help me move the shelf.

752
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,200
<33-10,BECKETT>我们究竟想找什么
<33-10,BECKETT>And what exactly are we hoping to find?

753
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,970
<33-11,CASTLE>真相  唐尼也想找到真相啊
<33-11,CASTLE>The truth. The same thing Donny was hoping for.

754
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,750
<33-11,CASTLE>里奥讲的那些故事
<33-11,CASTLE>In all the stories that Leo ever told,

755
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,860
<33-11,CASTLE>这位"酒吧历史学家"
<33-11,CASTLE>this bar historian,

756
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,800
<33-11,CASTLE>他有没有可能留给唐尼一个故事呢
<33-11,CASTLE>what if he saved one story just for Donny?

757
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,070
<33-11,CASTLE>一个里奥自己也无法证实的故事
<33-11,CASTLE>A story that Leo himself could never verify

758
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,000
<33-11,CASTLE>因为直到他死后
<33-11,CASTLE>because the trapdoor to the basement wasn't discovered

759
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,100
<33-11,CASTLE>地下室才被人发现
<33-11,CASTLE>until after he died.

760
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,810
<33-11,CASTLE>当比利·皮特决定卖掉这间酒吧
<33-11,CASTLE>When Billy Pitt decided to sell the bar,

761
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,630
<33-11,CASTLE>而TJ麦克查纳想买下时
<33-11,CASTLE>and T.J. Mcchucklenuts was going to buy it,

762
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,790
<33-11,CASTLE>唐尼意识到他必须及时找到真相
<33-11,CASTLE>Donny realized he had to find out before it was too late.

763
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,690
<33-12,BECKETT>什么真相
<33-12,BECKETT>Find what?

764
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,730
<33-13,CASTLE>唐尼卖掉自己的工会卡  并赌上全部身家
<33-13,CASTLE>Donny sold his union card and bet his life savings

765
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,230
<33-13,CASTLE>那个美男詹姆斯  过来
<33-13,CASTLE>That Beau James-- come.

766
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:24,930
<33-13,CASTLE>帮帮我
<33-13,CASTLE>Help me.

767
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,310
<33-13,CASTLE>我们动手吧
<33-13,CASTLE>There we go.

768
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,190
<33-13,CASTLE>美男詹姆斯的宝藏真的存在
<33-13,CASTLE>That Beau James' secret stash really existed.

769
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,930
<33-15,BECKETT>-你有在推吗  -我在推
<33-15,BECKETT>- are you pushing?  - I am pushing!

770
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,330
<33-16,BECKETT>好了
<33-16,BECKETT>Okay.

771
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,690
<33-16,BECKETT>那是
<33-16,BECKETT>That's...

772
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,150
<33-16,BECKETT>哇哦
<33-16,BECKETT>Wow.

773
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,860
<33-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<33-17,BECKETT>Oh, Castle.

774
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,210
<33-17,BECKETT>这是当安妮存钱时唐尼所处之地
<33-17,BECKETT>This is where Donny was when Annie made the drop.

775
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,490
<33-18,CASTLE>唐尼拉开这扇门
<33-18,CASTLE>Donny pulled on this door,

776
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,110
<33-18,CASTLE>然后哎呦喂  枪走火就中弹了
<33-18,CASTLE>and blam said the lady.

778
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,710
<33-19,BECKETT>你听到了吗
<33-19,BECKETT>Do you hear that?

779
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
<33-20,CASTLE>湍急的流水声
<33-20,CASTLE>Rushing water.

780
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,190
<33-21,BECKETT>如果这水流通到东河
<33-21,BECKETT>If that water leads to the east river,

781
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,260
<33-21,BECKETT>那么这里就可能是唐尼遇害的地点
<33-21,BECKETT>then that's probably where Donny was killed.

782
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,690
<33-22,BECKETT>你在干嘛
<33-22,BECKETT>What are you doing?

783
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,620
<33-23,CASTLE>我们需要照明  对吧
<33-23,CASTLE>We're gonna need a light, right?

784
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,570
<33-24,BECKETT>别得瑟  印第安纳[《夺宝奇兵》主角的名字]
<33-24,BECKETT>Not so fast, Indy.

785
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,830
<33-24,BECKETT>我们也需要可呼吸空气  所以
<33-24,BECKETT>We're also gonna need breathable air, so...

786
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,330
<33-25,CASTLE>火把多帅啊
<33-25,CASTLE>Torch would be more fun.

787
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,560
<34-1,BECKETT>这肯定是老下水道的一部分
<34-1,BECKETT>This must be a part of the old sewer system.

788
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,160
<34-2,CASTLE>可能是禁酒令期间的运输地道
<34-2,CASTLE>Probably used these as access tunnels during prohibition.

789
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,440
<34-2,CASTLE>真难以置信
<34-2,CASTLE>It's incredible, isn't it?

790
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,880
<34-3,BECKETT>是的  除了
<34-3,BECKETT>Yeah, aside from the fact that it's...

791
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,920
<34-3,BECKETT>潮湿狭窄  还很黑
<34-3,BECKETT>damp, cramped, dark,

792
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,950
<34-3,BECKETT>而且我们很明显踩在老鼠屎上  棒极了
<34-3,BECKETT>and we are almost certainly walking in rat poop. Awesome.

793
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,410
<34-4,CASTLE>别忘了CHUDS
<34-4,CASTLE>Don't forget the C.H.U.D.S.

794
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,100
<34-5,BECKETT>CHUDS是什么
<34-5,BECKETT>C.H.U.D.S?

795
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,270
<34-6,CASTLE>寄居地下的食人者[CHUDS的全称]
<34-6,CASTLE>Cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers.

796
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,450
<34-6,CASTLE>下水道里可不少这些
<34-6,CASTLE>These sewers are crawling with them.

797
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,520
<34-7,BECKETT>我还以为你是喜欢
<34-7,BECKETT>You know, I kind of figured you more

798
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,870
<34-7,BECKETT>《下水道里的短吻鳄》的那种人
<34-7,BECKETT>for an "Alligator in the sewer" type of guy.

799
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,050
<34-8,CASTLE>这里有短吻鳄吗
<34-8,CASTLE>There's alligators down here?

800
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,130
<34-9,CASTLE>这是什么
<34-9,CASTLE>What is this?

801
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,670
<34-10,BECKETT>看起来像是古旧的通道
<34-10,BECKETT>This looks like an old passageway

802
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,630
<34-10,BECKETT>用砖封住了很长时间
<34-10,BECKETT>that was bricked up a long time ago.

803
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,380
<34-11,CASTLE>是的  直到唐尼找到这里
<34-11,CASTLE>Yeah, until Donny got at it.

804
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,190
<34-12,CASTLE>沃克市长的绰号
<34-12,CASTLE>Mayor Walker's moniker.

805
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,870
<34-13,BECKETT>1919年  那是禁酒令开始的时间
<34-13,BECKETT>"1919"--that's when prohibition started.

807
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,460
<34-14,CASTLE>史上最棒的时空胶囊
<34-14,CASTLE>Best time capsule ever.

809
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,180
<34-14,CASTLE>想想看当唐尼发现里奥的传说是真的
<34-14,CASTLE>Imagine Donny's joy when he realized

810
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,840
<34-14,CASTLE>他该多欣喜若狂
<34-14,CASTLE>that Leo's legends were true.

811
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,490
<34-14,CASTLE>2万6千美金一瓶  谁还在乎布莱恩中饱私囊
<34-14,CASTLE>$26,000 a bottle--who cares if Brian was skimming?

812
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,060
<34-15,BECKETT>这些墙上足有上百瓶威士忌
<34-15,BECKETT>There's gotta be a hundred bottles of scotch on these walls.

813
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,950
<34-16,CASTLE>拿一瓶给大家看看
<34-16,CASTLE>Take one down and pass it around.

814
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,290
<34-17,BECKETT>住手  那是证据
<34-17,BECKETT>Hey. That's evidence.

815
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,170
<34-17,BECKETT>已经拿走很多了
<34-17,BECKETT>And there's already a lot that's been taken.

816
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,970
<34-18,CASTLE>都是最近拿的
<34-18,CASTLE>It's fairly recently, too.

817
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,470
<34-18,CASTLE>这些瓶子上附着厚厚的灰尘
<34-18,CASTLE>These bottles are caked with dust,

818
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,910
<34-18,CASTLE>空余的地方却相对干净
<34-18,CASTLE>and the empty spaces are relatively clean.

819
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,790
<34-19,BECKETT>这是谋杀凶器
<34-19,BECKETT>Here's our murder weapon.

820
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,920
<34-20,CASTLE>希望上面有指纹
<34-20,CASTLE>Hopefully with some prints on it.

821
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,510
<34-21,BECKETT>可能还混着血呢
<34-21,BECKETT>There's probably blood mixed in there, too...

822
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,410
<34-21,BECKETT>万一你想尝尝
<34-21,BECKETT>In case you were thinking of tasting it.

823
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,560
<34-22,CASTLE>得了  我还不至于饥不择食
<34-22,CASTLE>Come on. I'm not that desperate.

824
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,690
<34-23,BECKETT>有人发现了唐尼的宝藏
<34-23,BECKETT>So someone else finds out about Donny's treasure,

825
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,550
<34-23,BECKETT>跟踪他到了这里
<34-23,BECKETT>follows him down here,

826
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,470
<34-23,BECKETT>吓了他一跳  接着打了起来
<34-23,BECKETT>surprises him, a fight breaks out,

827
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,390
<34-23,BECKETT>凶手拿起唯一可用的凶器
<34-23,BECKETT>and the killer grabs the only weapon available...

828
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,980
<34-24,CASTLE>给他致命一击
<34-24,CASTLE>Striking the fatal blow.

829
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,840
<34-24,CASTLE>看起来我们的凶手
<34-24,CASTLE>And it looks like our killer

830
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,600
<34-25,BECKETT>沿着同样的路线把尸体拖出去
<34-25,BECKETT>dragged the body right back out the same way.

831
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,470
<34-25,BECKETT>看看这个  一路过来
<34-25,BECKETT>Look at this, all the way down.

832
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,230
<34-25,BECKETT>一直拖到这里
<34-25,BECKETT>And then it travels all the way...

833
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,330
<34-26,CASTLE>地道里应有尽有
<34-26,CASTLE>Ah, this tunnel has everything--

834
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,160
<34-26,CASTLE>威士忌宝藏
<34-26,CASTLE>Secret scotch vault,

835
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,730
<34-26,CASTLE>隐蔽的谋杀地点
<34-26,CASTLE>private murder nook,

836
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,970
<34-26,CASTLE>便捷的弃尸通道
<34-26,CASTLE>convenient sewage disposal.

837
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,980
<34-27,BECKETT>我肯定这水一直流向东河
<34-27,BECKETT>I bet you this water leads straight to the east river.

838
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,540
<34-28,CASTLE>这个还很亮
<34-28,CASTLE>This is fairly bright.

839
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,820
<34-28,CASTLE>几小时前有人来过
<34-28,CASTLE>Someone's been here in the past few hours.

840
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,200
<34-29,BECKETT>警察  不许动
<34-29,BECKETT>Police! Don't move!

841
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,540
<34-30,BECKETT>停  纽约警局
<34-30,BECKETT>Stop! NYPD!

842
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,480
<34-30,BECKETT>这边  这边
<34-30,BECKETT>This way. This way.

843
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,770
<34-31,BECKETT>他去哪了
<34-31,BECKETT>Where did he go?

844
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,190
<34-32,CASTLE>他就在我们前面  我听到了
<34-32,CASTLE>He was right in front of us. I heard him.

845
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,590
<34-33,BECKETT>这是个死胡同
<34-33,BECKETT>This is a dead end.

846
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,950
<34-33,BECKETT>他不可能在我们眼皮底下逃走
<34-33,BECKETT>He couldn't have gotten past us.

847
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,620
<34-34,CASTLE>他无路可逃
<34-34,CASTLE>There is no other way he could've gotten out.

848
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,330
<34-35,BECKETT>那他是怎么逃走的
<34-35,BECKETT>So how did he get away?

849
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,360
<35-1,MONTGOMERY>什么意思  消失
<35-1,MONTGOMERY>What do you mean, gone?

850
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,550
<35-2,BECKETT>他明明就在我们前面  接着
<35-2,BECKETT>He was right there in front of us, and then...

851
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,910
<35-2,BECKETT>就剩一堵墙了
<35-2,BECKETT>nothing but a brick wall.

852
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,510
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>那家伙不可能越过你们
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>And there's no way this guy could've gotten past you two

853
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,810
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>偷偷从"老地方"逃走吗
<35-3,MONTGOMERY>and snuck out through the Old Haunt?

854
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,720
<35-4,BECKETT>不可能  那里太窄了
<35-4,BECKETT>No, it was too narrow.

855
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,700
<35-5,CASTLE>酒保布莱恩和几个常客
<35-5,CASTLE>Brian the bartender and a handful of regulars

856
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,630
<35-5,CASTLE>仍在上面
<35-5,CASTLE>were still upstairs.

857
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,350
<35-5,CASTLE>他们发誓在我们之前没人出来过
<35-5,CASTLE>They swear, no one came out before we did.

858
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,260
<35-6,BECKETT>我们认为爱酒如命的市长
<35-6,BECKETT>We think that our spirit-loving mayor

859
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,550
<35-6,BECKETT>不想被人看到他进出
<35-6,BECKETT>didn't want to be seen going back and forth

860
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,930
<35-6,BECKETT>最爱的地下酒吧
<35-6,BECKETT>from his favorite speakeasy,

861
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,700
<35-6,BECKETT>因此在储藏室修了个后门
<35-6,BECKETT>So he had a back way entrance built to his stash.

862
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,520
<35-7,CASTLE>难于察觉  相信我  我们看过了
<35-7,CASTLE>Hidden from view, and trust me, we looked.

863
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,430
<35-8,ESPOSITO>刚刚接到蕾妮的电话
<35-8,ESPOSITO>Yo, just got off the phone with Lanie.

864
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,500
<35-8,ESPOSITO>证实碎酒瓶上的血迹是唐尼的
<35-8,ESPOSITO>She confirms the blood on the broken bottle is Donny's.

865
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,900
<35-8,ESPOSITO>这肯定是谋杀凶器
<35-8,ESPOSITO>It's definitely our murder weapon.

866
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,070
<35-9,RYAN>但我们比对了指纹  还没有找到匹配记录
<35-9,RYAN>But we run the prints, and we still came up empty.

867
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,150
<35-9,RYAN>在"老地方"或系统中都找不到
<35-9,RYAN>No matches to anyone at the Old Haunt or in our system.

868
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,550
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>花了70年才找到
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>It took 70 years to find a way

869
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,290
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>"老地方"下面的地道
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>down to those tunnels from the Old Haunt,

870
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,990
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>而凶手却找到另一个入口  怎么找到的
<35-10,MONTGOMERY>and somehow our killer finds another way in? How?

871
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,570
<35-11,BECKETT>从地道到东河下水道
<35-11,BECKETT>There's gotta be another access point

872
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:26,260
<35-11,BECKETT>应该还有一个入口
<35-11,BECKETT>from the tunnel to the east river sewer line.

873
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,070
<35-11,BECKETT>但官方的下水道地图里却没有显示
<35-11,BECKETT>But the sewer bureau's map doesn't have anything.

874
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,260
<35-11,BECKETT>好像联合爱迪生电力公司
<35-11,BECKETT>It's like Con Ed doesn't

875
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,570
<35-11,BECKETT>甚至不知道这些地道的存在
<35-11,BECKETT>even know those tunnels exist.

876
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,310
<35-12,CASTLE>因为这是现代下水道
<35-12,CASTLE>That's because these are modern sewer lines.

877
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,380
<35-12,CASTLE>当新的下水道修建时
<35-12,CASTLE>Any of the old sewer lines that didn't get patched in

878
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,220
<35-12,CASTLE>旧的如果利用不上
<35-12,CASTLE>when the new ones were built,

879
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,560
<35-12,CASTLE>旧的就会被堵住弃置
<35-12,CASTLE>they just got bricked up and abandoned.

880
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,760
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>这就像旧地铁线
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>That's like old subway lines.

881
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,200
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>有些整个地铁站在地下
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>There are whole stations underground

882
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,430
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>废弃了几十年
<35-13,MONTGOMERY>no one's seen for decades.

883
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,230
<35-14,BECKETT>总的来说  我们需要看看旧下水道地图
<35-14,BECKETT>So basically, we need to take a look at an old sewer map,

884
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,400
<35-14,BECKETT>一旦找出凶手消失的方向
<35-14,BECKETT>and once we figure out where our killer disappeared to,

885
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,500
<35-14,BECKETT>我们也许可以找到另一端的目击证人
<35-14,BECKETT>we might be able to find some witnesses on the other end.

886
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,380
<35-15,MONTGOMERY>去找地图吧
<35-15,MONTGOMERY>Then let's find that map.

887
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,300
<36-1,CASTLE>这地方也该弄得现代化一点了吧
<36-1,CASTLE>This place could use a little gentrification,

888
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,080
<36-1,CASTLE>至少应该弄个复印机吧
<36-1,CASTLE>at the very least, a copy machine.

889
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,230
<36-2,BECKETT>这是二战前的档案保管区  卡塞尔
<36-2,BECKETT>It's the pre-World War II archives section, Castle.

890
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,680
<36-2,BECKETT>这里一半的东西可能至少七十年都没人动过了吧
<36-2,BECKETT>Half of this probably hasn't been seen in over 70 years.

891
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,470
<36-2,BECKETT>1920年的下东区
<36-2,BECKETT>Lower East Side, 1920.

892
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,420
<36-2,BECKETT>禁酒令差不多就是这个时候开始实施的
<36-2,BECKETT>That's about when prohibition was getting started.

893
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,750
<36-3,CASTLE>你看那个年代
<36-3,CASTLE>Aw, you see how much nicer

894
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,650
<36-3,CASTLE>这个地区比现在好多少呀
<36-3,CASTLE>the neighborhood was back then?

895
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,370
<36-4,BECKETT>你觉得那个小格子会不会
<36-4,BECKETT>You think that little box there

896
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,150
<36-4,BECKETT>-就是"老地方"  -没错  位置是没错
<36-4,BECKETT>- might be the Old Haunt?  - Yeah, that's where it would be,

897
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,780
<36-5,CASTLE>那时候它还是所妓院呢
<36-5,CASTLE>not long after its bordello phase.

898
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,810
<36-5,CASTLE>你还能见到有人穿着吊袜带呢
<36-5,CASTLE>You can still see the little garter belts.

899
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,650
<36-6,BECKETT>这下面有条污水管道
<36-6,BECKETT>Okay, there's a sewer line

900
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,600
<36-6,BECKETT>新的地图上是没有标出来的
<36-6,BECKETT>running under it that wasn't on the newer map,

901
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,970
<36-6,BECKETT>所以这肯定就是我们要找的地道
<36-6,BECKETT>so that's gotta be our tunnel.

902
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,640
<36-7,CASTLE>那也就是说沃克的威士忌应该就藏在这
<36-7,CASTLE>Which would put Walker's whiskey right about here.

903
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,740
<36-7,CASTLE>他可以去酒窖拿上一瓶
<36-7,CASTLE>A man could grab himself a bottle, come and go

904
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,740
<36-7,CASTLE>来去都不会被人看见
<36-7,CASTLE>without ever being seen.

905
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,930
<36-8,BECKETT>但是从哪来回  起点是哪
<36-8,BECKETT>But come and go from where? Where did he start from?

906
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,020
<36-9,CASTLE>这里是地道的终点  我们的凶手也是在这消失的
<36-9,CASTLE>Here's where our tunnel ends and our killer vanished.

907
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,680
<36-9,CASTLE>这一点一共连接着
<36-9,CASTLE>There's one, two, three sewer lines

908
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,840
<36-9,CASTLE>一  二  三条污水管道呢
<36-9,CASTLE>that branch off from that point.

909
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,570
<36-10,BECKETT>凶手可能选择了任意一条
<36-10,BECKETT>Any of which our killer could've accessed

910
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,660
<36-10,BECKETT>从我们眼前逃走
<36-10,BECKETT>to get away from us.

911
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,360
<36-10,BECKETT>所以如果我们可以找出
<36-10,BECKETT>So if we can figure out

912
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,040
<36-10,BECKETT>这三条污水管道通向哪里
<36-10,BECKETT>exactly where the three sewers end,

913
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,730
<36-10,BECKETT>我们就可以申请法庭传票  收集凶手
<36-10,BECKETT>we can subpoena traffic cams

914
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,280
<36-10,BECKETT>逃跑的那个时间段里所有的交通摄像
<36-10,BECKETT>around the time the killer got away,

915
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,940
<36-10,BECKETT>也许能确认凶手的身份
<36-10,BECKETT>maybe get an I.D.

916
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,230
<36-11,CASTLE>也许根本用不着那么麻烦
<36-11,CASTLE>Or maybe we won't need any of that.

917
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,980
<36-11,CASTLE>你说七十多年来都没人
<36-11,CASTLE>You said no one has laid eyes on these maps

918
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,890
<36-2,BECKETT>看过这些地图
<36-2,BECKETT>in over 70 years,

919
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:56,960
<36-10,BECKETT>可是根据这张借书卡
<36-10,BECKETT>only it says here,

920
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,410
<36-11,CASTLE>两个星期前才有人借出过这张地图
<36-11,CASTLE>someone checked this one out just two weeks ago.

921
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,000
<36-11,CASTLE>而且我以美男詹姆斯的威士忌打赌
<36-11,CASTLE>And I'll bet a bottle of Beau James' whiskey

922
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,370
<36-11,CASTLE>有人跟咱俩一样  想要找到一条
<36-11,CASTLE>that someone was trying to make their way

923
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,970
<36-11,CASTLE>通往市长藏酒室的路
<36-11,CASTLE>back to the mayor's stash, just like we are.

924
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,510
<36-12,CASTLE>第一次  第二次[拍卖术语]
<36-12,CASTLE>Going once, going twice...

925
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,010
<37-1,HEISLER>此项物品由坐在后面的那位先生收购
<37-1,HEISLER>Sold to the gentleman in the back.

926
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,410
<37-2,HEISLER>接下来  是一瓶1955年的
<37-2,HEISLER>Next up, we have a marvelous

927
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,440
<37-2,HEISLER>雷斯蒂沃城堡酒庄的白葡萄酒
<37-2,HEISLER>1955 Chateau Restivo Blanc,

928
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,300
<37-2,HEISLER>竞拍起价为一千二百美金
<37-2,HEISLER>and we'll start the bidding at $1,200.

929
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,650
<37-4,HEISLER>有人出价一千二百美金吗
<37-4,HEISLER>Do I hear $1,200?

930
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,370
<37-5,HEISLER>一千二百美金  有一千两百五十美金吗
<37-5,HEISLER>There's $1,200. Do I hear $1,250?

931
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,440
<37-4,HEISLER>一千两百五十美金  有人出价一千三吗
<37-4,HEISLER>$1,250 there. $1,300?

932
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,770
<37-2,HEISLER>一千三
<37-2,HEISLER>13 --

933
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,350
<37-1,HEISLER>后面有人出价一千三百美金
<37-1,HEISLER>$1,300 in the back.

934
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,080
<37-5,HEISLER>有一千三百五十美金吗
<37-5,HEISLER>Do I hear $1,350?

935
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,350
<37-5,HEISLER>一千三百五
<37-5,HEISLER>$1,350...

936
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,560
<37-5,HEISLER>一千三百五十
<37-5,HEISLER>$1,350...

937
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,310
<37-5,HEISLER>有人出价
<37-5,HEISLER>Do I hear...

938
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,420
<37-5,HEISLER>一千四百
<37-5,HEISLER>14 --

939
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,150
<38-1,BECKETT>这只是一场唐尼信错了人而导致的悲剧
<38-1,BECKETT>It's just a sad case of Donny trusting the wrong guy.

940
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,570
<38-1,BECKETT>他告诉海斯勒他找到了美男詹姆斯的藏酒
<38-1,BECKETT>He told Heisler about the Beau James' stash,

941
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,450
<38-1,BECKETT>-海斯勒就起了贪念  -他说服唐尼
<38-1,BECKETT>- and Heisler got greedy.  - He convinced Donny

942
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,580
<38-2,CASTLE>如果他把这些威士忌分开
<38-2,CASTLE>that the whiskey would fetch a better price

943
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,870
<38-2,CASTLE>一次只卖一瓶  价格会抬得更高
<38-2,CASTLE>if he sold it a bottle at a time,

944
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,460
<38-2,CASTLE>于是唐尼就没动剩下的藏酒
<38-2,CASTLE>so Donny left the stash where he found it.

945
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,330
<38-3,BECKETT>这给了海斯勒充裕的时间
<38-3,BECKETT>And that gave Heisler

946
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,080
<38-3,BECKETT>去寻找藏酒
<38-3,BECKETT>enough time to figure out where it was hidden.

947
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,030
<38-3,BECKETT>当唐尼在酒窖里将海斯勒抓了个现行
<38-3,BECKETT>When Donny caught him in the vault,

948
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,940
<38-3,BECKETT>海斯勒惊慌失措地用酒瓶打了他
<38-3,BECKETT>Heisler panicked, hit him with a bottle.

949
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,850
<38-4,ESPOSITO>我们搞清楚
<38-4,ESPOSITO>Yo. We figured out

950
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,150
<38-4,ESPOSITO>海斯勒是怎么从你们眼前消失的了
<38-4,ESPOSITO>how Heisler disappeared on you in the tunnel.

951
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,450
<38-5,CASTLE>密道
<38-5,CASTLE>Secret passageway.

952
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,900
<38-5,CASTLE>差不多是这么回事
<38-5,CASTLE>Basically.

953
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,100
<38-6,ESPOSITO>他有一个秘密入口  是只能从
<38-6,ESPOSITO>He had a hidden entrance that could only be opened

954
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,760
<38-6,ESPOSITO>外边打开的  鉴证组发现
<38-6,ESPOSITO>from the other side. Now CSU followed it

955
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,010
<38-6,ESPOSITO>这条通道从废弃的污水管一直通往地道
<38-6,ESPOSITO>from the street to the abandoned sewer to the tunnel,

956
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,730
<38-6,ESPOSITO>就像沃克市长计划的一样
<38-6,ESPOSITO>just like Mayor Walker had drew it up.

957
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,270
<38-7,RYAN>这是海斯勒还没来得及
<38-7,RYAN>Here's, uh, three cases

958
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,400
<38-7,RYAN>卖的三箱酒
<38-7,RYAN>that Heisler hadn't gotten around to selling yet.

959
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,180
<38-8,RYAN>两万六一瓶的话
<38-8,RYAN>At 26 g's a pop,

960
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,030
<38-8,RYAN>这里总共也值差不多一百万美金了
<38-8,RYAN>you're looking at just under a cool million.

961
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,510
<38-9,CASTLE>让我摸摸  我怎么才能买上一瓶
<38-9,CASTLE>I just -- how might I acquire one of these for myself?

962
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,350
<38-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我跟你说过  这些是证据
<38-10,BECKETT>Castle, I told you, they're evidence.

963
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,790
<38-11,CASTLE>没错  但是谁说得准今天的证据
<38-11,CASTLE>Yes, but who's to say that today's evidence

964
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,810
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>-不会成为明天的睡前饮料呢  -我说得准
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>- can't be tomorrow's nightcap?  - That would be me.

965
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,760
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>我相信我们肯定得花上几个月的时间
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>I'm sure it'll be a few months before we can figure out

966
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,580
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>才能确定这些酒到底归谁所有
<38-12,MONTGOMERY>where this and the rest of this stuff belongs.

967
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,830
<38-13,MONTGOMERY>我是蒙哥马利
<38-13,MONTGOMERY>Montgomery. Yeah.

968
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,160
<38-14,CASTLE>真漂亮呀
<38-14,CASTLE>Look at you.

969
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,140
<38-15,ALEXIS>酷吧  格雷西带我去一间
<38-15,ALEXIS>Isn't it cool? Gracie took me shopping

970
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,690
<38-15,ALEXIS>我根本没听说过的店买衣服
<38-15,ALEXIS>in this place I never even knew existed,

971
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,120
<38-15,ALEXIS>那间店离这只有一街之隔
<38-15,ALEXIS>and it's right down the street from here.

972
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,070
<38-15,ALEXIS>那卖的东西很棒  她的眼光也超好
<38-15,ALEXIS>They had the greatest stuff. She has a really good eye.

973
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,200
<38-16,GRACIE>是阿丽克西斯穿什么都好看
<38-16,GRACIE>Well, Alexis looks good in everything.

974
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,430
<38-17,CASTLE>很高兴见到你们俩又重归于好了
<38-17,CASTLE>I'm glad you two reconnected.

975
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,760
<38-18,ALEXIS>我们只是要花点时间重新了解对方
<38-18,ALEXIS>We just had to get to know the new uses.

976
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,570
<38-18,ALEXIS>我们俩都不再是十岁的小屁孩了
<38-18,ALEXIS>Neither of us are 10 anymore.

977
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,860
<38-19,GRACIE>谢谢你让我住在卡塞尔豪宅
<38-19,GRACIE>Thanks for letting me crash at Chez Castle.

978
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,760
<38-19,GRACIE>让我回想起小时候不知生活艰辛的
<38-19,GRACIE>It reminded me of the good ol' days

979
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,270
<38-19,GRACIE>那些美好的时光  你明白吗
<38-19,GRACIE>before life got too real, you know?

980
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,000
<38-20,CASTLE>我明白
<38-20,CASTLE>I do know.

981
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,980
<38-21,ALEXIS>我陪她走去火车站
<38-21,ALEXIS>I'm gonna walk her to the train.

982
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,210
<38-22,CASTLE>拜拜
<38-22,CASTLE>Bye.

983
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,180
<38-23,ALEXIS>奶奶在楼下等着呢
<38-23,ALEXIS>Gram's waiting downstairs.

984
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:27,970
<38-24,CASTLE>谢谢你提前给我打预防针
<38-24,CASTLE>Thanks for the warning.

985
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,520
<38-25,BECKETT>我还记得我那个阶段呢
<38-25,BECKETT>Wow. I remember that phase.

986
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,540
<38-25,BECKETT>我差不多就是那个时候纹的身
<38-25,BECKETT>That's about when I got my tattoo.

987
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,530
<38-26,CASTLE>你还有纹身呢  在
<38-26,CASTLE>You've got a tattoo? Well, on --

988

<38-27,CASTLE>在哪
<38-27,CASTLE>I...where?

989
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,380
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>刚跟地方检察官通过电话  卡塞尔
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>Just heard from the DA, Castle.

990
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,790
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>既然这些酒
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>Apparently since all of these bottles

991
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,850
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>曾经归我们的前任市长
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>used to belong to Beau James,

992
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,130
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>美男詹姆斯所有
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>and he used to be our mayor,

993
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,020
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>她建议现在将这些酒归为市有财产
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>it's her opinion that they're owned by the city.

994
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,890
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>但是她说  如果你愿意慷慨解囊
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>But she says if you're willing to make a generous donation

995
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,280
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>赞助纽约警局的孤儿寡母基金的话
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>to the NYPD widows and orphans' fund,

996
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,390
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>就送你一瓶美男詹姆斯的上好威士忌
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>you can have one of Beau James' best for your very own.

997
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,980
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>这是你提前收到的圣诞大礼了
<38-28,MONTGOMERY>This is early christmas, baby.

999
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,610
<38-29,CASTLE>我真没想到会如此幸运
<38-29,CASTLE>I was not expecting this.

1000
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,940
<38-30,ESPOSITO>-你在哭吗  -是的
<38-30,ESPOSITO>- Are you crying?  - Yes.

1001
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,800
<38-31,CASTLE>我激动地不知道该说什么好了
<38-31,CASTLE>I don't know what to say.

1002
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,040
<38-32,BECKETT>说"让我拿支票簿来写张支票"就行了
<38-32,BECKETT>Try "Let me get my checkbook".

1003
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,910
<38-33,CASTLE>当然  这是当然了  但是我
<38-33,CASTLE>Yes, of course. Of course. But I...

1004

<38-33,CASTLE>我不能一个人独占  我要跟你们一起分享
<38-33,CASTLE>I will only accept this if you all share it with me.

1005
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,720
<38-34,MONTGOMERY>-就等你这句话了  -不行
<38-34,MONTGOMERY>- Twist my arm.  - No.

1006
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,370
<38-35,CASTLE>在这不行  要去"老地方"
<38-35,CASTLE>Not here. Um, at the Old Haunt.

<38-36,RYAN>对哦  说起那个地方
<38-36,RYAN>Yeah, well, what ab -- what about that place?

1009
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,600
<38-36,RYAN>"老地方"将会被如何处置呢
<38-36,RYAN>What happens to the Old Haunt?

1010
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,960
<38-37,ESPOSITO>那里将会被银行收回  也就是说
<38-37,ESPOSITO>It's gonna go back to the bank, which means that

1011
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,890
<38-37,ESPOSITO>TJ麦克查纳又要再次竞价了
<38-37,ESPOSITO>T.J. Mcchucklenuts is gonna get another shot at it.

1012
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,200
<38-38,CASTLE>用不着担心"老地方"
<38-38,CASTLE>Oh, I wouldn't worry about the Old Haunt.

1013
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,490
<38-39,BECKETT>你把它买下了  对吧
<38-39,BECKETT>You bought it, didn't you?
