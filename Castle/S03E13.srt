67
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,040
<3-14,BECKETT>为什么  因为你明知有蹊跷
<3-14,BECKETT>Why? Because you wrote it off

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,150
<3-14,BECKETT>却把那个案子算作是帮派暴力案件吗
<3-14,BECKETT>as random gang violence when you knew it wasn't?

<3-15,RAGLAN>-我是服从命令  -是啊

70
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,140

<3-15,RAGLAN>And I kept quiet because I was afraid.

71

<3-15,RAGLAN>一年前

<3-15,RAGLAN>你击杀了一个名叫迪克·库南的杀手
<3-15,RAGLAN>You killed a hit man named Dick Coonan.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,650
<3-15,RAGLAN>当时报纸上大篇幅报道
<3-15,RAGLAN>It was a big deal in the papers.

75
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,360
<3-15,RAGLAN>大家都知道了
<3-15,RAGLAN>People noticed.

<3-16,BECKETT>Who hired Coonan to kill my mom?

77

<3-17,RAGLAN>那时候我还不知道乔安·贝克特是谁
<3-17,RAGLAN>back before I ever knew who Johanna Beckett was.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,340
<3-17,RAGLAN>19年前  我...
<3-17,RAGLAN>19 years ago, I...

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,930
<3-17,RAGLAN>我犯了一个大错
<3-17,RAGLAN>I made a bad mistake.

82
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,800
<3-17,RAGLAN>之后就如多尼诺骨牌一般  一错再错
<3-17,RAGLAN>And that started the dominoes falling.

83
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,330
<3-17,RAGLAN>其中一个就是你妈妈...
<3-17,RAGLAN>And one of 'em was your mom--

<5-5,ESPOSITO>肯定有人会看到一些情况
<5-5,ESPOSITO>Somebody had to have seen something in there.

131
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,690
<5-6,BECKETT>莱恩  我敢肯定杀拉格兰的杀手
<5-6,BECKETT>Ryan, I am betting that Raglan's murderer

132
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,560
<5-6,BECKETT>跟踪他来到这里
<5-6,BECKETT>followed him here.

133
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,640
<5-6,BECKETT>你能不能去询问他的邻居
<5-6,BECKETT>Can you check with his neighbors,

134
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,020
<5-6,BECKETT>看看有没有人今早在他家附近逗留
<5-6,BECKETT>See if anyone was hanging around his place this morning?

135
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,690
<5-7,RYAN>-没问题  -谢谢
<5-7,RYAN>- You got it. - Thanks.

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,830
<5-8,BECKETT>嘿
<5-8,BECKETT>Hey.

137
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,220
<5-10,BECKETT>-嘿  -你还好吗
<5-10,BECKETT>- Hey. - You good?

138
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,170
<5-11,CASTLE>是啊  应该是把血迹洗掉了
<5-11,CASTLE>Yeah. I think I got it all off my hands.

139
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,010
<5-12,BECKETT>命案就发生在眼前跟其他事情是不一样的
<5-12,BECKETT>It's different when it happens right in front of you.

140
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,650
<5-12,BECKETT>你会清楚地看到人呼出最后一口气
<5-12,BECKETT>You're close enough to watch the lights go out.

141
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,540
<5-12,BECKETT>是啊
<5-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,080
<5-13,CASTLE>当我看到你衣服上的血迹
<5-13,CASTLE>When I saw the blood on your shirt,

143
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,170
<5-13,CASTLE>我还以为你中弹了
<5-13,CASTLE>I thought you'd been shot.

144
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,640
<5-14,BECKETT>我要去12分局
<5-14,BECKETT>Um, I'm gonna go to the 12th.

145
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,770
<5-14,BECKETT>我把你送到你家吧
<5-14,BECKETT>How about I drop you off at your place?

146
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,040
<5-15,CASTLE>想都别想
<5-15,CASTLE>Not a chance.

147
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,950
<5-15,CASTLE>好吧
<5-15,CASTLE>Okay.

148
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,560
<6-1,ESPOSITO>我检查了四楼
<6-1,ESPOSITO>So I checked out the fourth floor.

149
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,580
<6-1,ESPOSITO>没有指纹  没有弹匣  也没有目击者
<6-1,ESPOSITO>There's no prints, no casings, no witnesses,

150
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,760
<6-1,ESPOSITO>但好消息是  那幢大楼有安保监控
<6-1,ESPOSITO>But the good news is, it's a secure building.

151
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,040
<6-1,ESPOSITO>只能通过大厅进出
<6-1,ESPOSITO>The only way in or out is through the lobby,

152
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,140
<6-1,ESPOSITO>而想要通过大厅的十字旋转门
<6-1,ESPOSITO>and nobody gets through the lobby turnstiles

153
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,200
<6-1,ESPOSITO>必须有门卡
<6-1,ESPOSITO>without a key card.

154
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
<6-2,CASTLE>就是说枪手有门卡
<6-2,CASTLE>So our shooter had a card.

155
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,570
<6-3,ESPOSITO>没错  他们正把员工名单发过来
<6-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they're sending over a list of all their employees.

156
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,570
<6-3,ESPOSITO>另外还有
<6-3,ESPOSITO>They're also downloading

157
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,250
<6-3,ESPOSITO>大厅的监控录像
<6-3,ESPOSITO>surveillance video from the lobby.

158
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,930
<6-4,RYAN>各位  我跟他邻居谈了谈
<6-4,RYAN>Hey. So I, uh, talked to the neighbors.

159
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,960
<6-4,RYAN>拉格兰是鳏夫  没能找到近亲
<6-4,RYAN>Raglan was a widower. No next of kin that I could find.

160
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,680
<6-4,RYAN>管理员说基本没人找他
<6-4,RYAN>Super said he didn't really even have visitors,

161
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,540
<6-4,RYAN>只有一个伙计偶尔过来
<6-4,RYAN>except every once in a while, his buddy would come over

162
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,100
<6-4,RYAN>看洋基队比赛
<6-4,RYAN>to watch a yankee game.

163
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,400
<6-4,RYAN>叫盖瑞·麦卡利斯特  是拉格兰的老同学
<6-4,RYAN>Gary McCallister, Raglan's old academy classmate.

164
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,790
<6-5,BECKETT>联系麦卡利斯特
<6-5,BECKETT>Get ahold of McCallister.

165
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,440
<6-5,BECKETT>看他能否过来趟  我得跟他谈谈
<6-5,BECKETT>See if he'll come. I want to talk to him.

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,070
<6-6,ESPOSITO>好的
<6-6,ESPOSITO>You got it.

167
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,760
<6-7,BECKETT>十九年前
<6-7,BECKETT>19 years ago.

168
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,530
<6-9,BECKETT>-什么  -拉格兰想跟我们说
<6-9,BECKETT>- What's that? - Raglan started telling us about something

169
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,130
<6-9,BECKETT>发生在十九年前的某件事
<6-9,BECKETT>that happened 19 years ago.

170
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,790
<6-9,BECKETT>我母亲被害于十二年前
<6-9,BECKETT>My mom's murder was 12 years ago.

171
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,070
<6-9,BECKETT>说不通啊
<6-9,BECKETT>It's not making any sense.

172
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,090
<6-9,BECKETT>知道吗  我鼎盛的年华
<6-9,BECKETT>you know, I sacrificed my best years

173
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,640
<6-9,BECKETT>还有噩梦般的婚姻都献给了这鬼城市
<6-9,BECKETT>and worst marriages to this damn city.

174
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,860
<6-9,BECKETT>本以为已经够糟了  原来还有更糟的
<6-9,BECKETT>You'd think that'd be enough, but it never is.

175
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,190
<6-9,BECKETT>连我的好朋友都不放过
<6-9,BECKETT>Had to gobble up my best friend, too.

176
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,100
<7-1,BECKETT>你最后一次见约翰·拉格兰是什么时候
<7-1,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw John Raglan?

177
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,250
<7-1,BECKETT>大约一周前  他跟我说他快死了
<7-1,BECKETT>Week ago. Told me he was dying.

178
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,220
<7-2,BECKETT>他还说什么了
<7-2,BECKETT>What else did he tell you?

179
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,560
<8-24,ESPOSITO>这还不够吗
<8-24,ESPOSITO>Isn't that enough?

180
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
<8-24,ESPOSITO>不过我不大明白
<8-24,ESPOSITO>But I don't get it.

181
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,350
<7-1,BECKETT>拉格兰在你当警察前就退休了
<7-1,BECKETT>Raglan was retired by the time you come on the job.

182
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,350
<7-2,BECKETT>怎么会跟你有瓜葛
<7-2,BECKETT>What'd he want with you?

183
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,470
<7-3,BECKETT>拉格兰正在协助我
<7-3,BECKETT>Raglan was helping me with a-a cold case

184
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,970
<7-3,BECKETT>调查一宗悬案
<7-3,BECKETT>that I was working on.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,320
<7-3,BECKETT>我认为他应该就是被人灭口了
<7-3,BECKETT>I believe he was killed to keep him quiet.

186
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,170
<7-3,BECKETT>拉格兰似乎认为这宗悬案
<7-3,BECKETT>Look, Raglan seemed to think that the case

187
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,540
<7-3,BECKETT>跟他十九年前做过的某件事有关
<7-3,BECKETT>had something to do with something he did 19 years ago.

188
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,410
<7-3,BECKETT>你知道是什么事吗
<7-3,BECKETT>What was he into back then?

189
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,780
<7-3,BECKETT>什么事
<7-3,BECKETT>What was he into?

190
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,670
<7-3,BECKETT>约翰·拉格兰又不是圣人
<7-3,BECKETT>John Raglan was no angel,

191
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,010
<7-3,BECKETT>当时的纽约也和现在大不一样
<7-3,BECKETT>and New York was a different city back then,

192
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,750
<7-3,BECKETT>我只能告诉你
<7-3,BECKETT>And I'm here to tell you,

193
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,220
<7-3,BECKETT>小屁孩过家家式的调查一点用没有
<7-3,BECKETT>Kid gloves didn't get it done out there.

194
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,140
<7-4,BECKETT>什么事情都需要警察插一脚
<7-4,BECKETT>You police a damn theme park.

195
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,860
<7-4,BECKETT>你要是现在想给什么人沉冤昭雪啥的
<7-4,BECKETT>You're lookin' to start some half-assed truth commission.

196
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,860
<7-4,BECKETT>我可没那闲工夫
<7-4,BECKETT>You can count me out.

197
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,420
<7-4,BECKETT>我并不是想否定拉格兰的过去
<7-4,BECKETT>I'm not trying to tarnish Raglan's memory.

198
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,890
<7-4,BECKETT>我只想找到杀他的凶手
<7-4,BECKETT>I'm trying to find his murderer.

199
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,610
<7-5,BECKETT>我说过让他离那个人远点儿
<7-5,BECKETT>I told him not to get involved with that guy.

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,890
<7-6,CASTLE>-谁  -瓦肯·西蒙斯
<7-6,CASTLE>- With who? - Vulcan Simmons.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
<7-6,CASTLE>瓦肯·西蒙斯是谁
<7-6,CASTLE>Vulcan Simmons?

202
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,040
<7-7,BECKETT>他操纵着纽约大半的毒品交易
<7-7,BECKETT>He runs half the drug trade in New York.

203
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,060
<7-7,BECKETT>拉格兰常嫖娼[PONY:Prostitute of New York]
<7-7,BECKETT>Raglan liked to play the ponies.

204
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,410
<7-7,BECKETT>差不多十九年前
<7-7,BECKETT>19, 20 years ago would be about the time

205
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,460
<7-8,CASTLE>他正走背字
<7-8,CASTLE>he had a string of bad luck

206
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,220
<7-8,CASTLE>手头很紧
<7-8,CASTLE>and he was hard up for money.

207
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,420
<7-8,CASTLE>然后突然宽裕了
<7-8,CASTLE>And then he wasn't.

208
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,770
<7-8,CASTLE>然后突然宽裕了
<7-8,CASTLE>And then he wasn't.

209
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,040
<7-11,ESPOSITO>有传言说
<7-11,ESPOSITO>Word was, he got well

210
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,760
<7-11,ESPOSITO>他帮西蒙斯运毒
<7-11,ESPOSITO>working as a dope courier for Simmons,

211
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,300
<7-11,ESPOSITO>开着巡逻车  辗转于各镇之间
<7-11,ESPOSITO>moving product across town in his patrol car.

212
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,720
<7-11,ESPOSITO>拉格兰在凶案组干了四年
<7-11,ESPOSITO>Raglan worked homicide for four years.

213
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,520
<7-11,ESPOSITO>我很清楚西蒙斯会斩尽杀绝
<7-11,ESPOSITO>And I know Simmons put people in the ground.

214
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,060
<9-1,MARTHA RODGERS>要是是我的案子
<9-1,MARTHA RODGERS>If it were my case,

215
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,770
<7-7,BECKETT>我就好好研究瓦肯·西蒙斯
<7-7,BECKETT>I'd take a hard look at Vulcan Simmons.

216
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,040
<7-8,CASTLE>暴力攻击  蓄意谋杀  敲诈勒索
<7-8,CASTLE>Assault, attempted murder, extortion,

217
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,060
<7-9,BECKETT>恶意强占  威胁目击证人...
<7-9,BECKETT>possession with intent, witness intimidation...

218
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,330
<7-9,BECKETT>然后就不了了之
<7-9,BECKETT>Then it looks like it just dries up.

219
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,750
<7-9,BECKETT>多年来  在没人逮捕过他
<7-9,BECKETT>Nobody's booked him in years.

220
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,750
<7-10,CASTLE>这说明什么  他皈依我佛了
<7-10,CASTLE>So what does that mean, he found religion?

221
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,920
<7-11,ESPOSITO>说明他学聪明了  更善于掩藏自己
<7-11,ESPOSITO>It means he got smart. Swimminng deeper waters.

222
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,110
<7-12,RYAN>看来华盛顿高地事件后他进步不小
<7-12,RYAN>Guess he's come a long way since Washington Heights.

223
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,570
<7-13,BECKETT>等等  什么  华盛顿高地
<7-13,BECKETT>Wait. What? You said Washington Heights?

224
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,030
<7-14,RYAN>过去有段时间
<7-14,RYAN>Back in the day,

225
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,860
<7-14,RYAN>西蒙斯曾在华盛顿高地
<7-14,RYAN>Simmons used to run the drug trade

226
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,510
<7-14,RYAN>搞毒品交易
<7-14,RYAN>in Washington Heights.

227
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,700
<7-15,BECKETT>我妈妈和她的同事们
<7-15,BECKETT>My mom and a group of her colleagues,

228
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,020
<7-15,BECKETT>发动了一场叫做
<7-15,BECKETT>they put together this campaign

229
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,550
<7-15,BECKETT>"还我家园"的活动
<7-15,BECKETT>called "Take back the Neighborhood".

230
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,650
<7-15,BECKETT>他们试图借此将毒贩
<7-15,BECKETT>They were trying to get drug dealers off the streets

231
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,160
<7-15,BECKETT>赶出华盛顿高地
<7-15,BECKETT>in Washington Heights.

232
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,310
<7-16,RYAN>由于西蒙斯正是那个地区的老大
<7-16,RYAN>With Simmons running all the dope in that neighborhood,

233
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,810
<7-16,RYAN>那场活动应该让他损失不小
<7-16,RYAN>that campaign would cost him.

234
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,030
<7-16,RYAN>而那个职业杀手库南又是个瘾君子
<7-16,RYAN>That hit man, Coonan, we know that he was into dope.

235
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,950
<7-16,RYAN>也许西蒙斯就是这样找上他的
<7-16,RYAN>Maybe that's how Simmons got in contact with him.

236
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,100
<7-17,CASTLE>于是西蒙斯雇库南杀了所有相关人员
<7-17,CASTLE>So Simmons hires Coonan to kill them all,

237
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,790
<7-17,CASTLE>包括你母亲  然后买通老朋友拉格兰
<7-17,CASTLE>including your mother, and pays his old friend Raglan

238
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,450
<7-17,CASTLE>把这起谋杀案记录为流氓犯罪
<7-17,CASTLE>to write off their homicides as random gang violence.

239
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,150
<7-17,CASTLE>这样一来  就没可能
<7-17,CASTLE>There would've been no way to trace

240
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,240
<7-17,CASTLE>把他和谋杀案联系起来
<7-17,CASTLE>the murders back to him.

241
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,570
<7-18,BECKETT>直到拉格兰决定
<7-18,BECKETT>Until Raglan threatens to

242
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,160
<7-18,BECKETT>将自己的所做作为和盘托出
<7-18,BECKETT>reveal his role in the conspiracy,

243
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,850
<7-18,BECKETT>西蒙斯就想办法杀人灭口
<7-18,BECKETT>and Simmons has him silenced.

244
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,700
<7-19,ESPOSITO>午饭之前保证把人逮到
<7-19,ESPOSITO>We'll have him in the box before lunch.

245
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,270
<7-19,ESPOSITO>上次看到你的时候  你还不化妆呢
<7-19,ESPOSITO>You painted since the last time I was here.

246
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,190
<7-19,ESPOSITO>你大概也就十六岁
<7-19,ESPOSITO>You'd have been about 16,

247
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,640
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>跟满脸粉刺的毛头小子
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>wrestling some pimply kid

248
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,260
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>在他爸爸的车里嬉闹
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>in the back of his Daddy's wagon,

249
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,530
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>不知道要不要跟他做
<8-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>wondering if you were gonna give it to him or not.

250
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,900
<8-2,CASTLE>喂  该闭嘴了
<8-2,CASTLE>Hey. That's enough.

251
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,040
<8-3,SIMMONS>这小子喜欢你  才敢跟我嚣张
<8-3,SIMMONS>He's sweet on you. Makes him brave.

252
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,740
<8-4,BECKETT>你跟约翰·拉格兰警探什么关系
<8-4,BECKETT>What was your association with Detective John Raglan?

253
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,520
<8-4,BECKETT>拉格兰  拉格兰  拉格兰
<8-4,BECKETT>Raglan? Raglan, Raglan, Raglan?

254
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,010
<8-4,BECKETT>那个饥渴的警察  对吧
<8-4,BECKETT>Thirsty cop, right?

255
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,840
<8-4,BECKETT>没人救得了他吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Couldn't pick a winner to save his life?

256
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,900
<8-4,BECKETT>探长  如你所言
<8-4,BECKETT>Well, Detective, our association,

257
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,460
<8-4,BECKETT>我们的关系
<8-4,BECKETT>as you put it,

258
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,020
<8-5,BECKETT>几辈子以前就超越了法规的局限
<8-5,BECKETT>exceeded the statute of limitations many moons ago.

259
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,800
<8-5,BECKETT>谋杀案里不存在所谓的法规的局限
<8-5,BECKETT>There is no statute of limitations on murder,

260
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,490
<8-5,BECKETT>西蒙斯先生
<8-5,BECKETT>Mr. Simmons.

261
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,050
<8-6,SIMMONS>传说中的初次交锋开始了么
<8-6,SIMMONS>And here begins what is known as the initial confrontation.

262
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,720
<8-6,SIMMONS>在这个审讯阶段
<8-6,SIMMONS>During this phase of the interrogation,

263
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,780
<8-6,SIMMONS>审讯者会侵犯
<8-6,SIMMONS>the interrogator may invade

264
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,030
<8-6,SIMMONS>嫌犯的个人空间
<8-6,SIMMONS>the suspect's personal space

265
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,920
<8-6,SIMMONS>以增加其不适感
<8-6,SIMMONS>in order to increase his discomfort.

266
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,700
<8-6,SIMMONS>你想侵犯我个人空间吗
<8-6,SIMMONS>You want to invade my personal space?

267
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,920
<8-7,BECKETT>看着我
<8-7,BECKETT>Look at me.

268
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,620
<8-7,BECKETT>十二年前  乔安·贝克特
<8-7,BECKETT>12 years ago, Johanna Beckett led

269
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,500
<8-7,BECKETT>在华盛顿高地领导发动了
<8-7,BECKETT>a big take back the neighborhood campaign

270
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,210
<8-7,BECKETT>一场夺回生活家园的活动
<8-7,BECKETT>in Washington Heights.

271
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,310
<8-8,CASTLE>你对此肯定很不爽
<8-8,CASTLE>And that must have pissed you off.

272
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,540
<8-9,SIMMONS>原来这才是主线
<8-9,SIMMONS>And this would be theme development.

273
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,880
<8-9,SIMMONS>借助嫌犯的视角  重现谋杀
<8-9,SIMMONS>Presenting the crime through the eyes of the suspect.

274
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,710
<8-9,SIMMONS>乔安·贝克特
<8-9,SIMMONS>Johanna Beckett was murdered

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,950
<8-10,BECKETT>和她的两名同事被害
<8-10,BECKETT>along with two of her colleagues.

276
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,210
<8-10,BECKETT>凶手都是奉你命令行事的职业杀手
<8-10,BECKETT>They were professional hits carried out on your orders.

277
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,040
<8-10,BECKETT>你又让你的走狗
<8-10,BECKETT>And you had

278
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,590
<8-10,BECKETT>凶案组约翰·拉格兰警探掩盖此事
<8-10,BECKETT>your pet homicide Detective John Raglan bury them.

279
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,270
<8-10,BECKETT>看着她的脸
<8-10,BECKETT>Look at her face.

280
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,940
<8-10,BECKETT>告诉我你不记得她
<8-10,BECKETT>Tell me you don't remember her.

281
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,740
<8-11,SIMMONS>知道吗  贝克特探长
<8-11,SIMMONS>You know, Detective Beckett...

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,230
<8-11,SIMMONS>我觉得我记得她
<8-11,SIMMONS>I think I do remember her.

283
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,120
<8-11,SIMMONS>像垃圾一样倒在小巷里流血身亡
<8-11,SIMMONS>Bled out in an alley like the trash she was.

284
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,730
<8-12,BECKETT>西蒙斯先生  你最好看清楚
<8-12,BECKETT>Mr. Simmons, you better watch it.

285
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,940
<8-13,SIMMONS>从上东区高地来的的有钱婊子
<8-13,SIMMONS>Rich bitch from uptown on safari in the Heights.

286
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
<8-13,SIMMONS>应该有人提醒她
<8-13,SIMMONS>Somebody should warned her

287
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,290
<8-13,SIMMONS>千万不要挑衅或侵犯那些牲畜们
<8-13,SIMMONS>not to feed or tease the animals.

288
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,180
<8-14,BECKETT>你...
<8-14,BECKETT>You...

289
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,390
<8-15,SIMMONS>要是有人提醒过  她就不会被野兽咬着
<8-15,SIMMONS>If they had, she might not have gotten eaten.

290
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,350
<8-15,SIMMONS>不过据我所知
<8-15,SIMMONS>From what I hear, though...

291
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,490
<8-15,SIMMONS>她还挺可口的
<8-15,SIMMONS>she was pretty tasty.

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,840
<8-16,CASTLE>贝克特
<8-16,CASTLE>whoa, Beckett!

293
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,810
<8-17,BECKETT>退下  卡塞尔
<8-17,BECKETT>Back off, Castle!

294
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,580
<8-17,BECKETT>瓦肯  好好珍惜你那条老命
<8-17,BECKETT>Remember your old life, Vulcan. Savor it.

295
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,180
<8-19,BECKETT>因为我会拿了你的狗命
<8-19,BECKETT>Because I am gonna take it all away.

296
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,910
<8-19,BECKETT>退下  贝克特  别过火
<8-19,BECKETT>Stand down. Beckett, that's enough.

<8-20,ESPOSITO>退下
<8-20,ESPOSITO>Stand down.

<8-26,BECKETT>-你意识到了吗 -长官  你也听到他说什么了
<8-26,BECKETT>- You realize that? - Sir, you heard him.

302
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,150
<8-26,BECKETT>他马上就要供认谋杀案了
<8-26,BECKETT>He as much as confessed to the murder.

<8-27,MONTGOMERY>我们没有任何证据证明他与拉格兰或者
<8-27,MONTGOMERY>We've got nothing to tie him to raglan's murder

306
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,750
<8-27,MONTGOMERY>你妈妈的被害有关  你不准再调查此案了
<8-27,MONTGOMERY>or your mother's. You're off this case.

307
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,380
<8-28,BECKETT>不  长官  你不能这么做  尤其是现在
<8-28,BECKETT>No, sir. You can't do that. Not now.

308

<8-34,CASTLE>我做错了什么
<8-34,CASTLE>What did I do?

313
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,460
<8-35,MONTGOMERY>我不需要你在这件案子上扮演少女妙探
<8-35,MONTGOMERY>I don't need you playing Nancy Drew on this.

314

<8-36,ESPOSITO>My partner and I don't wish to be insubordinate...

318
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,800
<8-37,RYAN>但我们想礼貌地拒绝这项任务
<8-37,RYAN>but we respectfully decline the assignment.

319
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,660
<8-38,MONTGOMERY>我的警徽上写的什么
<8-38,MONTGOMERY>What does it say on my badge?

320
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,580
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>-"长官" -现在好好读一下这精美的印刷
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>- "Captain." - Now read the fine print.

<8-40,MONTGOMERY>It says get your ass out there and solve Raglan's murder

322
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,510
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>在我把你们俩降职为交通警察之前
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>before I bust you both back down to traffic.

<9-1,MARTHA RODGERS>What if it had been you?

327
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,130
<9-2,CASTLE>我不知道你在家
<9-2,CASTLE>I didn't know you were home.

335
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,610
<9-7,MARTHA>你他妈的怎么能问出这种问题
<9-7,MARTHA>How the hell can you ask me something like that?

336
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,350
<9-7,MARTHA>想一想你有多爱亚历克西斯
<9-7,MARTHA>Think about how much you love Alexis,

337
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,940

<9-7,MARTHA>你怎么敢问我的火从何而来
<9-7,MARTHA>And don't you dare ask me where this is coming from.

339
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,510
<9-7,MARTHA>你凭借着智慧和魅力以及很高的天赋
<9-7,MARTHA>You have gotten through most of your life

340
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,180
<9-7,MARTHA>顺顺利利了大半辈子
<9-7,MARTHA>on your wit and charm and no small amount of talent.

341
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,440
<9-7,MARTHA>但外面是真枪实弹的世界
<9-7,MARTHA>But that is the real world out there,

342
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,740
<9-7,MARTHA>在子弹面前施展魅力是没用的
<9-7,MARTHA>and you can't charm your way out of a bullet.

343
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,890
<9-8,CASTLE>你认为我应该全身而退吗
<9-8,CASTLE>You think I should quit?

344
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,250
<9-9,MARTHA>我认为你应该仔细想清楚
<9-9,MARTHA>I think you should be honest with yourself

345
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,430
<9-9,MARTHA>你现在这么做的动机是什么
<9-9,MARTHA>about why you're doing this.

346
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,100
<9-9,MARTHA>在没遇见她之前你写了二十二本书
<9-9,MARTHA>You have written 22 novels before you met her,

347
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,520
<9-9,MARTHA>你没有必要为了完成作品
<9-9,MARTHA>and you didn't need to spend every day in a police station

348
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,040
<9-9,MARTHA>每天都呆在警局
<9-9,MARTHA>in order to finish them.

349
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,720
<9-10,CASTLE>这早已和写书无关了
<9-10,CASTLE>It's not about the books anymore.

350
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,620
<9-11,ESPOSITO>你认为是西蒙斯雇的狙击手吗
<9-11,ESPOSITO>So you think that Simmons hired the sniper?

351
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,720
<9-12,RYAN>如果我们找到了狙击手  我们可以问问他
<9-12,RYAN>If we find the sniper, we can ask him.

352
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,520
<9-12,RYAN>我觉得他一定得先把枪拆了  对吧
<9-12,RYAN>I figure, he had to disassemble his rifle, right?

353
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,470
<9-12,RYAN>把他的武器拆成不那么受怀疑的形状
<9-12,RYAN>Break his weapon down to a less conspicuous shape

354
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,240
<9-12,RYAN>才能带着它走过大厅
<9-12,RYAN>in order to get it through the lobby.

355
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
<9-12,RYAN>像一些正好能装进公文包的东西
<9-12,RYAN>Something that would fit inside of a briefcase.

356
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,760
<9-13,ESPOSITO>大厅里的每个人都拿着一个该死的公文包
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Everyone in that lobby's carrying a damn briefcase.

357
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,150
<9-14,RYAN>你该拿出点警探的样子来了
<9-14,RYAN>You should be a detective.

358
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,390
<9-14,RYAN>这件案子我们不能空手而归
<9-14,RYAN>We can't come up empty on this one.

359
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,040
<9-15,ESPOSITO>我知道  老兄
<9-15,ESPOSITO>I know, bro.

360
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,940
<9-16,RYAN>那是场意外事故
<9-16,RYAN>Whoa. That wasn't an accident.

361
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,240
<9-17,ESPOSITO>他刚刚偷了她的门卡
<9-17,ESPOSITO>He just lifted her key card.

362
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,820
<9-17,ESPOSITO>从门卡获取狙击手信息
<9-17,ESPOSITO>Well, so much for the card telling us

363
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,560
<9-18,RYAN>-这条线索就这么断了 -等一下
<9-18,RYAN>- who the sniper was. - Wait a minute.

364
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,080
<9-18,RYAN>他没有带手套
<9-18,RYAN>He's not wearing gloves.

365
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,610
<9-19,ESPOSITO>那又怎样  他没碰到任何可印表面
<9-19,ESPOSITO>So what? He didn't touch any printable surfaces.

366
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,770
<9-20,RYAN>没错  但他碰了她
<9-20,RYAN>Yeah, but he touched her.

367
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,480
<9-20,RYAN>我们能从尸体上找到指纹  是吧
<9-20,RYAN>We can print a dead body, right?

368
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,670
<9-20,RYAN>那我们为什么不能从活人身上找到呢
<9-20,RYAN>So why can't we print a live one?

369
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,870
<9-21,ESPOSITO>她现在可能已经洗过澡了
<9-21,ESPOSITO>She's probably showered by now.

370
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,090
<9-22,RYAN>未必  今天是周六  而且下午才刚刚过完
<9-22,RYAN>Not necessarily. It's Saturday. And it's barely afternoon.

371
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,530
<9-22,RYAN>来吧
<9-22,RYAN>Come on.

372
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,230
<9-23,BECKETT>嗨  卡塞尔
<9-23,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

373
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,790
<9-23,BECKETT>嗨
<9-23,BECKETT>Hey.

374
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,080
<9-24,CASTLE>乔什去哪了
<9-24,CASTLE>Where's Josh?

375
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,710
<9-25,BECKETT>他在非洲  在拯救世界呢
<9-25,BECKETT>Oh, he's in Africa. He's saving the world.

376
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,020
<9-26,CASTLE>我给你带了一些...
<9-26,CASTLE>Uh, I brought you some...

377
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,900
<9-26,CASTLE>我只是觉得经历过这些事...
<9-26,CASTLE>I just thought, after everything, that...

378
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,060
<9-26,CASTLE>你可能需要一些...
<9-26,CASTLE>you might wanna...

379
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,170
<9-26,CASTLE>给
<9-26,CASTLE>Here.

380
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,830
<9-27,BECKETT>谢谢
<9-27,BECKETT>Thank you.

381
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,190
<9-27,BECKETT>这真的很贴心
<9-27,BECKETT>That's really sweet.

382
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,220
<9-27,BECKETT>-你想进来吗 -当然
<9-27,BECKETT>- You wanna come in? - Sure.

383
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,060
<9-28,CASTLE>房间很漂亮
<9-28,CASTLE>Wow. Nice.

384
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,050
<9-28,CASTLE>我在来的路上一直在想
<9-28,CASTLE>You know, I was thinking on the way over here,

385
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,370
<9-28,CASTLE>所有最棒的警察...《警探哈里》
<9-28,CASTLE>all the best cops...Dirty Harry,

386
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,600
<9-28,CASTLE>漫画里的哥普拉  还有 《警察学校》里面
<9-28,CASTLE>Cobra, the guy from "Police academy"

387
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,900
<9-28,CASTLE>那个会用口技模仿直升机声音的家伙
<9-28,CASTLE>who makes the helicopter noises...

388
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,550
<9-28,CASTLE>-他们都有一个共同的特点 -神勇的小跟班么
<9-28,CASTLE>- They all have one thing common. - Plucky sidekick?

389
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,270
<9-30,CASTLE>那是一方面  而且他们都是在被踢出调查组
<9-30,CASTLE>That, and they do their very best work

390
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,090
<9-30,CASTLE>之后做出了最棒的工作
<9-30,CASTLE>after they've been booted off a case.

391
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,400
<9-31,BECKETT>这就是你一路跑来这想要告诉我的吗
<9-31,BECKETT>Is that what you came all the way over here to tell me?

392
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,030
<9-32,CASTLE>蒙哥马利把我们踢出了拉格兰的案子
<9-32,CASTLE>Montgomery booted us off the raglan murder.

393
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,340
<9-32,CASTLE>但对于你妈妈的案子他只字未提
<9-32,CASTLE>But he didn't say anything about your mother's case,

394
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,680
<9-32,CASTLE>是吧
<9-32,CASTLE>did he?

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,410
<9-32,CASTLE>我的计划是这样的...我戴着帽子偷偷溜到警局里
<9-32,CASTLE>Here's my plan...I sneak back into the station wearing a hat.

396
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,770
<9-32,CASTLE>蒙哥马利总是每过一小时有十五分钟的
<9-32,CASTLE>Montgomery always takes a coffee break

397
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,360
<9-32,CASTLE>喝咖啡休息时间
<9-32,CASTLE>15 minutes after the hour.

398
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,070
<9-32,CASTLE>我穿着软底鞋偷偷拿走你妈妈案子的文件
<9-32,CASTLE>I get your mother's file wearing soft shoes.

399
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,350
<9-32,CASTLE>南入口处有...怎么了
<9-32,CASTLE>The south entrance has... What?

400
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,690
<9-33,BECKETT>过来卡塞尔  我给你看些东西
<9-33,BECKETT>Come on, castle. I gotta show you something.

401
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,870
<9-34,CASTLE>你知道  我有时会忘记
<9-34,CASTLE>You know, I sometimes forget

402
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:47,680
<9-34,CASTLE>你对这些已是刻骨铭心
<9-34,CASTLE>that you live with this every day.

403
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,020
<9-34,CASTLE>乔什知道这些吗
<9-34,CASTLE>Josh know about this?

404
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
<9-35,BECKETT>不知道
<9-35,BECKETT>No.

405
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,880
<9-36,CASTLE>你什么时候开始的
<9-36,CASTLE>When did you start?

406
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,190
<9-37,BECKETT>整整一夏天 当你在汉普顿的时候
<9-37,BECKETT>Over the summer, when you were in the hamptons.

407
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,270
<9-38,CASTLE>-你查到多少了 -除了我妈妈
<9-38,CASTLE>- And how far have you gotten? - Well, aside from my mom,

408
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,000
<9-39,BECKETT>被杀的还有戴安娜·卡瓦诺和詹妮弗·斯图尔特
<9-39,BECKETT>there was also Diane Cavanaugh, Jennifer Stewart.

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,530
<9-39,BECKETT>她们有时给我妈妈做义务劳动
<9-39,BECKETT>They volunteered for her from time to time

410
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,910
<9-39,BECKETT>为司法倡议组织
<9-39,BECKETT>for the justice initiative.

411
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,870
<9-39,BECKETT>第四位被害者是斯科特·穆雷
<9-39,BECKETT>And then the fourth victim was Scott Murray.

412
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,490
<9-39,BECKETT>他是法院里的一位文员
<9-39,BECKETT>He was a document clerk at the courthouse.

413
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,200
<9-39,BECKETT>你知道吗卡塞尔  直到今天我一直追查此案是
<9-39,BECKETT>You know, castle, up until today, I'd always run this

414
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,460
<9-39,BECKETT>建立在他们因一起正在调查的合法案件
<9-39,BECKETT>on the theory that they got killed because of a legal case

415
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,250
<9-39,BECKETT>而被谋杀的假设上
<9-39,BECKETT>that they were working on.

416
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,350
<9-39,BECKETT>我妈妈在被杀之前
<9-39,BECKETT>My mom requested a court file

417
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,740
<9-39,BECKETT>申请调查一份法庭文件
<9-39,BECKETT>just before she was murdered,

418
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,860
<9-39,BECKETT>那份文件失踪了
<9-39,BECKETT>and that file went missing.

419
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,820
<9-40,CASTLE>你妈妈肯定有私人记录
<9-40,CASTLE>Well, your mom must have had personal papers,

420
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820
<9-40,CASTLE>日程本之类的东西可以告诉你
<9-40,CASTLE>an appointment book, something that could tell you

421
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,910
<9-40,CASTLE>她死之前在调查什么
<9-40,CASTLE>what she was working on before she died.

422
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,040
<9-41,BECKETT>我九年之前就把那些东西全看过了
<9-41,BECKETT>Oh, I went through all of that nine years ago.

423
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,670
<9-41,BECKETT>什么也没有
<9-41,BECKETT>There's nothing.

424
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:39,800
<9-42,CASTLE>没错  但自从那以后发生了很多事
<9-42,CASTLE>Yeah, but a lot's happened since then.

425
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,820
<9-42,CASTLE>也许你漏掉了什么
<9-42,CASTLE>Maybe you missed something.

426
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,900
<12-70,CASTLE>摸过我胳膊的那家伙是杀人犯吗
<12-70,CASTLE>So the guy who touched my arm was a murderer?

427
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,950
<12-72,CASTLE>我就知道  为什么我总是吸引变态
<12-72,CASTLE>Figures. Why do I attract all the creeps?

428
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,790
<12-75,JOE PULGATTI>我和一个叫克雷格的家伙约会过
<12-75,JOE PULGATTI>I dated this one guy, Craig,

429
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,500
<12-77,PULGATTI>差不多有两个月吧  我那时感觉
<12-77,PULGATTI>for like two months, and I thought,

430
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,160
<12-79,PULGATTI>他就是我的唯一  有天晚上我给他打电话
<12-79,PULGATTI>like, he was the one. And I called him up one night,

431
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,550
<12-82,CASTLE>他室友接的电话  告诉我
<12-82,CASTLE>and his roommate answered the phone and told me

432
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,750
<12-84,PULGATTI>克雷格已经死了  我简直崩溃了
<12-84,PULGATTI>that Craig had died, and I was, like, devastated.

433
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,560
<8-7,BECKETT>我和他室友  我们把他的骨灰
<8-7,BECKETT>And me and the roommate, we scattered his ashes

434
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,020
<8-8,CASTLE>撒在了中央公园
<8-8,CASTLE>throughout central park...the whole thing.

435
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,780
<8-9,SIMMONS>我是靠心理引导  外加一票男人
<8-9,SIMMONS>And I worked through the stages of grief with my life coach

436
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,940
<3-14,BECKETT>才挺过了悲恸期
<3-14,BECKETT>and a lot of random guys,

437
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,240
<3-15,RAGLAN>正当我准备接受事实时
<3-15,RAGLAN>and I was getting into acceptance

438
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,100
<3-15,RAGLAN>却在一个酒吧撞到了克雷格
<3-15,RAGLAN>when I ran into Craig at a bar.

439
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,560
<10-1,RYAN>-他捏造了自己的死  -好难以置信
<10-1,RYAN>- He had faked his own death. - Unbelievable.

440
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,730
<10-1,RYAN>我知道  他应该做的一切只不过是告诉我他不想
<10-1,RYAN>I know, right? All he had to do was say he didn't want us

441
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,070
<10-1,RYAN>和我再约会下去了  我又不是什么精神变态
<10-1,RYAN>to date anymore. I mean, it's not like I'm some psycho.

442
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,500
<11-1,TECH GUY>-看上去我们找到了一枚指纹  -谢谢
<11-1,TECH GUY>- Looks like we got a lift. - Thank you.

443
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,470
<11-1,TECH GUY>我睡觉晚也是挺好一件事吧
<11-1,TECH GUY>Oh. Well, good thing I slept in late, huh?

444
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,300
<12-1,BECKETT>她的日程本里面没有任何线索
<12-1,BECKETT>There's nothing in her appointment book.

445
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,900
<12-1,BECKETT>至少没有什么是我能看出苗头的
<12-1,BECKETT>Not that I can make sense of anyway.

446
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,170
<12-1,BECKETT>她有她自己的记录方式
<12-1,BECKETT>She had her own system.

447
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,670
<12-1,BECKETT>我爸和我从来没看懂过
<12-1,BECKETT>I mean, my dad and I could never figure it out.

448
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,710
<12-2,CASTLE>你那时真可爱
<12-2,CASTLE>Aww. You were adorable.

449
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,240
<12-2,CASTLE>这是你妈妈拍的吗
<12-2,CASTLE>Did your mom take these?

450
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,570
<12-3,BECKETT>是的  大概在她死前三周
<12-3,BECKETT>Yeah, about three weeks before she died.

451
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,200
<12-3,BECKETT>啊  我好想看你现场摆造型啊
<12-3,BECKETT>Oh, I don't get to see you in action?

452
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,790
<12-4,BECKETT>信我吧  卡塞尔  一点都没看头
<12-4,BECKETT>Trust me, Castle. It was not pretty.

453
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,330
<12-5,CASTLE>那就更得看看了
<12-5,CASTLE>Oh, now I have to see it.

454
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,550
<12-6,BECKETT>怎么了
<12-6,BECKETT>What?

455
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,030
<12-7,CASTLE>这一卷有24张底片
<12-7,CASTLE>There's 24 exposures on this role,

456
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,510
<12-7,CASTLE>却只有20张照片
<12-7,CASTLE>but there's only 20 pictures.

457
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,370
<12-8,BECKETT>这是什么
<12-8,BECKETT>What is it?

458
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,210
<12-9,CASTLE>无人的街道
<12-9,CASTLE>An empty street?

459
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,210
<12-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这是我妈妈被杀的地点
<12-10,BECKETT>Castle, this is where my mom was murdered.

460
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,770
<12-10,BECKETT>我不明白
<12-10,BECKETT>I don't understand.

461
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,490
<12-10,BECKETT>这些照片是她被害
<12-10,BECKETT>I mean, these pictures were developed

462
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,930
<12-10,BECKETT>一周前拍的
<12-10,BECKETT>a week before she was killed.

463
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,260
<12-11,CASTLE>她干嘛要拍那条巷子的照片呢
<12-11,CASTLE>Why would she be taking photos of that alley?

464
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,530
<12-12,BECKETT>我不知道  我一直以为
<12-12,BECKETT>I don't know. I always thought

465
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,840
<12-12,BECKETT>这只是方便凶手作案的地方
<12-12,BECKETT>it was just a convenient place for the killer to attack.

466
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,170
<12-12,BECKETT>因为那里又黑暗  又隐秘
<12-12,BECKETT>I mean, it was dark, it was secluded.

467
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,120
<12-13,CASTLE>如果还有其他原因呢
<12-13,CASTLE>What if there was more to it than that?

468
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,660
<12-13,CASTLE>如果在她被害时
<12-13,CASTLE>What if she was looking into something

469
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,150
<12-13,CASTLE>她在那里寻找什么呢
<12-13,CASTLE>that happened in that alley when they killed her?

470
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,390
<12-14,BECKETT>我得查查以前的档案和报告
<12-14,BECKETT>Well, I'd have to go into the old archives and reports,

471
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,840
<12-14,BECKETT>但蒙哥马利队长现在
<12-14,BECKETT>and captain Montgomery won't

472
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,290
<12-14,BECKETT>是不会让我回警局的
<12-14,BECKETT>let me back into the precinct right now.

473
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,310
<12-15,CASTLE>我去
<12-15,CASTLE>I'll go.

474
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,360
<12-16,RYAN>哈尔·洛克伍德
<12-16,RYAN>Hal Lockwood.

475
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,220
<12-16,RYAN>男性  白人  32岁
<12-16,RYAN>Male, white, 32.

476
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,770
<12-16,RYAN>身家清白
<12-16,RYAN>Record's clean.

477
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,010
<12-16,RYAN>根据记录
<12-16,RYAN>According to this,

478
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,310
<12-16,RYAN>洛克伍德连交通罚单都没领过
<12-16,RYAN>Lockwood's never had so much as a traffic citation.

479
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,420
<12-16,RYAN>信用记录仅可以查到两年前
<12-16,RYAN>Credit history only goes back about two years.

480
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,240
<12-17,ESPOSITO>肯定是用假身份证
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Well, it's gotta be a cover I.D.

481
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,680
<12-18,RYAN>他的信用卡有在使用
<12-18,RYAN>huh. His credit card's active.

482
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,720
<12-18,RYAN>上面显示洛克伍德现在入住了
<12-18,RYAN>It shows Lockwood's checked into a corporate suite

483
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,220
<12-18,RYAN>市中心的商用套房
<12-18,RYAN>in midtown right now.

484
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,130
<12-18,RYAN>纽约警局  走走走
<12-18,RYAN>NYPD! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

485
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,690
<13-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  没人
<13-1,BECKETT>NYPD clear!

486
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,970
<12-17,ESPOSITO>没人
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Clear.

487
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,620
<12-18,RYAN>没人
<12-18,RYAN>Clear.

488
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,270
<12-19,RYAN>看来我们刚好错过了
<12-19,RYAN>Looks like we just missed him.

489
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,370
<12-20,ESPOSITO>看这个
<12-20,ESPOSITO>Yo. Look at this.

490
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,010
<12-20,ESPOSITO>他一直在跟踪她
<12-20,ESPOSITO>He's been watching her.

491
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,010
<12-17,ESPOSITO>莱恩和埃斯波西托追查到
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Ryan and Esposito traced your sniper

492
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,690
<12-18,RYAN>狙击手在市中心的一个商用套房里
<12-18,RYAN>to a corporate suite in midtown.

493
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,530
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>自拉格兰谋杀案以来  他一直盯着你
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>He's been on you since Raglan's murder.

494
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,650
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>这不只是持枪的疯子
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>This isn't just a kook with a deer rifle

495
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,520
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>还是现实版的《麦田里的守望者》
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>and a copy of "Catcher in the rye."

496
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,750
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>这家伙是职业杀手  专业训练且资金充足
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>This guy is a professional-- highly trained and well-funded.

497
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,700
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>也许是某团伙中的一员
<12-21,MONTGOMERY>Maybe part of a team.

498
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,180
<12-22,BECKETT>长官  我们得通知卡塞尔
<12-22,BECKETT>Sir, we gotta let Castle know.

499
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,580
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>他知道了  他回了12分局
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>He does. He's back at the 12th.

500
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,300
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>我在男厕所抓到他
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>I caught him in the men's room,

501
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,500
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>正在偷看旧报告
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>poking through some old reports.

502
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,000
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>这事你有什么解释的吗
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>You want to tell me about that?

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,880
<12-24,BECKETT>你真的想知道吗
<12-24,BECKETT>You real want to know?

504
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,120
<12-25,MONTGOMERY>我会把细节告诉你
<12-25,MONTGOMERY>Listen, I'm gonna have to put a detail on you.

505
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,590
<12-25,MONTGOMERY>但你必须呆在家里
<12-25,MONTGOMERY>But I need you to stay home.

506
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,220
<12-26,BECKETT>如果这狙击手是冲着我来的
<12-26,BECKETT>If this sniper is after me,

507
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,320
<12-26,BECKETT>最安全的地方就是警局
<12-26,BECKETT>the safest place in the city is the 12th.

508
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,700
<12-26,BECKETT>你得让我跟这个案子  罗伊
<12-26,BECKETT>You gotta let me have this, Roy.

509
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,940
<12-26,BECKETT>让我回来查我妈妈的案子
<12-26,BECKETT>Let me come back and work on my mom's case.

510
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,920
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>不  我很抱歉
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>No, I'm sorry.

511
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,890
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>绝对不行
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>Absolutely not.

512
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,070
<12-28,RYAN>鉴证组分析了
<12-28,RYAN>C.S.U. Analyzed the capsules

513
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,060
<12-28,RYAN>在洛克伍德套房里找到的胶囊
<12-28,RYAN>we found in Lockwood's suite

514
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,590
<12-28,RYAN>发现含有一种高浓缩
<12-28,RYAN>and found they contain a highly concentrated form

515
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,880
<12-28,RYAN>叫普拉西泮的抗抑郁药
<12-28,RYAN>of an antianxiety drug called prazepam.

516
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,590
<12-29,ESPOSITO>这就对了
<12-29,ESPOSITO>That fits.

517
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,900
<12-29,ESPOSITO>优秀的狙击手得克服心跳的影响
<12-29,ESPOSITO>A good sniper fires between heartbeats.

518
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,350
<12-29,ESPOSITO>在特种部队里  有些人
<12-29,ESPOSITO>Back in special forces, some of the guys

519
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,900
<12-29,ESPOSITO>会使用抗抑郁药使心跳放慢
<12-29,ESPOSITO>would use antianxiety meds to slow down their heart rate.

520
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,910
<12-29,ESPOSITO>给他们更多射击的时间
<12-29,ESPOSITO>gives 'em more time to shoot.

521
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,940
<12-30,RYAN>但这些不是从普通商贩那里就能买到的
<12-30,RYAN>But these didn't come from any commercial lab.

522
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,670
<12-30,RYAN>而是来源于大街上贩毒分子
<12-30,RYAN>They were hand-ground by someone on the street,

523
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,260
<12-30,RYAN>非常精通药理的人
<12-30,RYAN>someone very good with chemicals.

524
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,930
<12-31,ESPOSITO>比如瓦肯·西蒙斯
<12-31,ESPOSITO>Someone like Vulcan Simmons.

525
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,870
<12-32,RYAN>我也认为是这样  但是看看这个
<12-32,RYAN>I thought the same thing, but check this out.

526
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,530
<12-32,RYAN>毒贩有时会用这样的标签
<12-32,RYAN>Dealers sometimes use symbols like these

527
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,410
<12-32,RYAN>来标识产品
<12-32,RYAN>to mark their product.

528
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,340
<12-32,RYAN>这些不是西蒙斯的标签
<12-32,RYAN>These symbols don't belong to Simmons.

529
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,970
<12-32,RYAN>这是苏活区一个名叫查德·罗迪克的
<12-32,RYAN>They're the brand of a street pharmacist

530
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,880
<12-32,RYAN>江湖药剂师的品牌
<12-32,RYAN>in soho named Chad Rodrick.

531
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,980
<12-33,ESPOSITO>查德·罗迪克
<12-33,ESPOSITO>Chad Rodrick.

532
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,000
<12-33,ESPOSITO>你运气一定很好吧
<12-33,ESPOSITO>You must be one lucky guy.

533
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,320
<12-33,ESPOSITO>你曾因持有假麻黄碱
<12-33,ESPOSITO>You've been arrested for possession of pseudoephedrine,

534
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,440
<12-33,ESPOSITO>伪造3份处方
<12-33,ESPOSITO>possession of forged triplicate prescriptions,

535
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,620
<12-33,ESPOSITO>以及制造管制药物的罪名被逮捕
<12-33,ESPOSITO>and the manufacture of a controlled substance,

536
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,060
<12-33,ESPOSITO>但从未被定罪
<12-33,ESPOSITO>but never convicted.

537
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,930
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>那些都是误会
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>Those are all misunderstandings.

538
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,670
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>我只是一名普通大学生
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>I'm just a college student

539
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,820
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>只不过把我爸的律师号码放在了快捷拨号里
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>with my father's lawyer on speed dial.

540
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,040
<12-35,RYAN>知道自己为何在这里吗
<12-35,RYAN>You know why you're here?

541
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,820
<12-36,CHAD>不知道  但我想应该
<12-36,CHAD>No, but I'm going to guess it

542
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,250
<12-36,CHAD>和班级结怨有关
<12-36,CHAD>has something to do with class resentment.

543
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,440
<12-36,CHAD>就凭你们这种级别能插手这案子
<12-36,CHAD>I bet it's a special treat

544
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,140
<12-36,CHAD>一定是得到了什么特殊待遇吧

<12-48,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<12-48,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,820
<12-49,CHAD>她要买东西的时候才出现

<12-49,CHAD>I swear. I don't even know how to get ahold of her.

576
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,920
<12-50,CASTLE>你跟蒙哥马利谈过了
<12-50,CASTLE>You talked to Montgomery?

<12-52,CASTLE>说说看
<12-52,CASTLE>Name it.

580
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,180
<12-53,BECKETT>回家
<12-53,BECKETT>Go home.

<12-54,CASTLE>想都别想  既入此门  再无畏惧
<12-54,CASTLE>Forget it. Fear does not exist in this dojo.

582
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,700
<12-55,BECKETT>我戴上警徽的那一刻起便不计生死了
<12-55,BECKETT>Look, I signed up for this when I put that badge on.

583
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,510
<12-55,BECKETT>但你没有  这不是你的斗争
<12-55,BECKETT>You didn't. It's not your fight.

584
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,590
<12-55,BECKETT>扯淡
<12-55,BECKETT>The hell it isn't.

585
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,540
<12-56,CASTLE>我整天围着你转并不是存心烦你
<12-56,CASTLE>I don't hang around you just to annoy you.

586
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,510
<12-56,CASTLE>我屡屡半夜赶到犯罪现场
<12-56,CASTLE>I don't ride out to murder scenes

587
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,340
<12-56,CASTLE>并非是为了满足我的好奇心
<12-56,CASTLE>in the middle of the night to satisfy some morbid curiosity.

588
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,920
<12-56,CASTLE>如果仅仅为了那些  我老早就离开了
<12-56,CASTLE>If that's all this was, I would've quit a long time ago.

589
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,160
<12-57,BECKETT>那你为何一直往返在我身边  里克
<12-57,BECKETT>Well, then why do you keep coming back, Rick?

590
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,360
<12-58,CASTLE>听着  我也许没有警徽
<12-58,CASTLE>Look, I may not have a badge,

591
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,060
<12-58,CASTLE>除非你把阿丽克西斯为我生日
<12-58,CASTLE>unless you count the chocolate one

592
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,040
<12-58,CASTLE>做的巧克力警徽算上
<12-58,CASTLE>that Alexis gave me for my birthday,

593
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,280
<12-58,CASTLE>但我要告诉你
<12-58,CASTLE>But I'll tell you this--

594
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,420
<12-58,CASTLE>不管你喜不喜欢  我就是你神勇的小跟班
<12-58,CASTLE>Like it or not, I'm your plucky sidekick.

595
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,710
<12-59,BECKETT>神勇的小跟班总是被杀的那个
<12-59,BECKETT>Plucky sidekick always gets killed.

596
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,670
<12-60,CASTLE>那么就做搭档吧
<12-60,CASTLE>Your partner, then.

597
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,700
<12-61,BECKETT>好吧  你发现了什么
<12-61,BECKETT>Okay. What'd you find?

598
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,440
<12-62,CASTLE>你记得拉格兰在咖啡室说过
<12-62,CASTLE>You remember what Raglan said back at the coffee shop

599
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,660
<12-62,CASTLE>-这事要回溯到19年前吗  -嗯
<12-62,CASTLE>- about this thing going back 19 years? - Uh-huh.

600
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,510
<12-64,CASTLE>原来  在你母亲遇害前
<12-64,CASTLE>Turns out, before your mother,

601
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,360
<12-64,CASTLE>那巷子发生过另一宗谋杀案
<12-64,CASTLE>there was another murder in this alley,

602
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,950
<12-64,CASTLE>当时那里曾是叫做巴勒莫之子的
<12-64,CASTLE>back when it was the back entrance to a club

603
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,360
<12-64,CASTLE>俱乐部后门  那是黑帮聚集地
<12-64,CASTLE>Called sons of palermo. It was a mafia hangout.

604
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,530
<12-65,BECKETT>我不知道那曾是个俱乐部
<12-65,BECKETT>I didn't know this was a club.

605
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,740
<12-66,CASTLE>那在你母亲遇害一年前停业了
<12-66,CASTLE>Well, it got shut down years before your mother was killed,

606
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,410
<12-66,CASTLE>就在一个叫鲍勃·阿门的联调局探员
<12-66,CASTLE>After an FBI agent by the name of Bob Armen

607
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,030
<12-66,CASTLE>-被杀害后  -上面说阿门
<12-66,CASTLE>- Was killed in the alley behind it. - It says Armen

608
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,430
<12-67,BECKETT>当时正在黑帮当卧底
<12-67,BECKETT>was working undercover in the mafia.

609
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,820
<12-68,CASTLE>不知怎么的他们盯上了阿门
<12-68,CASTLE>Somehow the mob got on to Armen,

610
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:42,440
<12-68,CASTLE>-用了传统方法  -就地正法
<12-68,CASTLE>- used the old family remedy. - Summary execution.

611
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,560
<12-70,CASTLE>纽约警局调查阿门谋杀案时
<12-70,CASTLE>The NYPD arrested a mob

612
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,320
<12-70,CASTLE>逮捕了一个叫乔·布伽地的黑帮成员
<12-70,CASTLE>in Armen's murder--a guy by the name of Joe Pulgatti.

613
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,190
<12-70,CASTLE>他后来认罪了
<12-70,CASTLE>He later pled guilty.

614
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,010
<12-70,CASTLE>猜猜是哪个警官逮捕他的
<12-70,CASTLE>And guess who the arresting officer was.

615
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,730
<12-71,BECKETT>约翰·拉格兰警官
<12-71,BECKETT>Officer John Raglan.

616
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,620
<12-72,CASTLE>你母亲是民权辩护律师
<12-72,CASTLE>Your mother was a civil rights attorney.

617
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,640
<12-72,CASTLE>她有说过阿门的谋杀案吗
<12-72,CASTLE>Did she ever mention Armen's murder

618
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,990
<12-72,CASTLE>-或是布伽地认罪的事情  -没有
<12-72,CASTLE>- or Pulgatti's conviction? - No,

619
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,300
<12-73,BECKETT>但两者肯定是有关联的
<12-73,BECKETT>but there's gotta be a connection somewhere.

620
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,370
<12-74,CASTLE>我打赌布伽地能帮我们弄清楚
<12-74,CASTLE>I bet Pulgatti could shed some light on it.

621
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,700
<12-75,JOE PULGATTI>我没杀害鲍比·阿门
<12-75,JOE PULGATTI>I didn't kill Bobby Armen.

622
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,370
<12-76,CASTLE>那你为什么要认罪
<12-76,CASTLE>Then why'd you plead guilty?

623
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,320
<12-77,PULGATTI>因为我不喜欢刑讯逼供的滋味
<12-77,PULGATTI>'cause I don't like needles.

624
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,490
<12-78,BECKETT>拉格兰警探声称命案发生时
<12-78,BECKETT>Detective Raglan places you in the alley

625
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,360
<12-78,BECKETT>你在巷子里
<12-78,BECKETT>at the time of the murder.

626
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,530
<12-79,PULGATTI>没错  我当时跟鲍比在巷子
<12-79,PULGATTI>Yeah, I was in that alley with Bobby.

627
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,370
<12-79,PULGATTI>我是那起谋杀案的唯一目击者
<12-79,PULGATTI>I was the only witness to his murder,

628
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,780
<12-79,PULGATTI>但那不是故意行凶
<12-79,PULGATTI>but it wasn't a hit.

629
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,030
<12-79,PULGATTI>那次是绑架失控了
<12-79,PULGATTI>It was a kidnapping that went sideways.

630
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,970
<12-79,PULGATTI>三个戴着滑雪面具的男人从货车出来
<12-79,PULGATTI>Three guys in ski masks rolled up in a van,

631
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,320
<12-79,PULGATTI>说他们要带我在城里一日游
<12-79,PULGATTI>said they wanted to take me on a tour of the city.

632
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,450
<12-79,PULGATTI>鲍比试着制止他们  他去夺其中一人的枪
<12-79,PULGATTI>Bobby tried to stop 'em, he went for one of their guns

633
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,180
<12-79,PULGATTI>最后落得如此下场
<12-79,PULGATTI>and wound up on the wrong end of it.

634
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,790
<12-80,CASTLE>那些家伙是敌对帮派的吗
<12-80,CASTLE>Were the guys from a rival family?

635
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,470
<12-81,PULGATTI>不  不可能  我们当时正在停战
<12-81,PULGATTI>No. No way. We had a truce going back then

636
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,550
<12-81,PULGATTI>因为那时候
<12-81,PULGATTI>bwecause there was this, uh,

637
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,500
<12-81,PULGATTI>出现了一个神秘帮派  都是职业绑架犯
<12-81,PULGATTI>ghost crew out there-- professional kidnappers

638
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,900
<12-81,PULGATTI>以五大帮派的成员为目标
<12-81,PULGATTI>targeting members of all five families.

639
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,940
<12-81,PULGATTI>我当时跟鲍比在巷子里
<12-81,PULGATTI>Look, I was in that alley with Bobby.

640
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,920
<12-81,PULGATTI>但没人会知道的
<12-81,PULGATTI>But no one else could've known that.

641
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,040
<12-81,PULGATTI>那巷子是个盲区
<12-81,PULGATTI>It was a blind alley.

642
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
<12-81,PULGATTI>鲍比遇害时  除了我就只剩下
<12-81,PULGATTI>And the only other people in it when Bobby was shot

643
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,820
<12-81,PULGATTI>那些开枪的人了
<12-81,PULGATTI>were the people who shot him.

644
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,160
<12-81,PULGATTI>现在  你说说看  探长
<12-81,PULGATTI>So you tell me, detective...

645
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,380
<12-81,PULGATTI>拉格兰怎么会知道我在那里呢
<12-81,PULGATTI>how could Raglan have known I was there?

646
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,950
<12-82,CASTLE>你是说  拉格兰是其中一个绑架犯
<12-82,CASTLE>You're saying Raglan was one of the kidnappers?

647
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,270
<12-83,BECKETT>那时候
<12-83,BECKETT>There was, uh...

648
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,820
<12-83,BECKETT>有个叫乔安·贝克特的律师
<12-83,BECKETT>A lawyer named Johanna Beckett.

649
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,760
<12-83,BECKETT>你认识她吗
<12-83,BECKETT>Are you familiar with her?

650
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,700
<12-83,BECKETT>大概在你入狱七年后
<12-83,BECKETT>She was murdered in the alley

651
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,260
<12-83,BECKETT>她在那个巷子遇害了
<12-83,BECKETT>about seven years into your incarceration.

652
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,520
<12-84,PULGATTI>你跟她长得很像  知道吗
<12-84,PULGATTI>You look just like her, you know?

653
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,060
<12-84,PULGATTI>你一走进来的时候
<12-84,PULGATTI>You first walked in here...

654
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,250
<12-84,PULGATTI>我还以为见到了亡灵
<12-84,PULGATTI>It was like I was looking at a ghost.

655
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,790
<12-84,PULGATTI>从她形容你的样子
<12-84,PULGATTI>The way she talked about you,

656
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,920
<12-84,PULGATTI>我早该猜到你后来会成为警察
<12-84,PULGATTI>I should've known you'd become a cop.

657
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,340
<12-84,PULGATTI>我  我给所有
<12-84,PULGATTI>I-I-I sent letters...

658
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,470
<12-84,PULGATTI>能找到的律师寄过信
<12-84,PULGATTI>to every lawyer I could find.

659
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,540
<12-84,PULGATTI>你母亲是唯一
<12-84,PULGATTI>And your mother was the only one

660
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,200
<12-84,PULGATTI>回信的人
<12-84,PULGATTI>who wrote me back,

661
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,680
<12-84,PULGATTI>唯一愿意在我身上冒险的人
<12-84,PULGATTI>the only one willing to take a chance on me.

662
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,110
<12-84,PULGATTI>她不在乎我是个混混
<12-84,PULGATTI>She didn't care that I was a thug.

663
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,060
<12-85,BECKETT>她只在乎事实
<12-85,BECKETT>All she cared about was the truth.

664
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,250
<12-86,PULGATTI>她来探访我
<12-86,PULGATTI>She came to visit me here

665
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,220
<12-86,PULGATTI>并且说她会负责跟进我的案子
<12-86,PULGATTI>and she said she'd look into my case.

666
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,640
<12-86,PULGATTI>不久后  我发现她被杀害了
<12-86,PULGATTI>Later, I found out she was murdered.

667
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,480
<12-86,PULGATTI>别为了追查这件案子丢了性命
<12-86,PULGATTI>Don't get yourself killed chasing this thing.

668
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,370
<12-86,PULGATTI>相信我的话  没有比揣着警徽的杀手
<12-86,PULGATTI>Take it from me. There's nothing more dangerous out there

669
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,150
<12-86,PULGATTI>更危险的了
<12-86,PULGATTI>than a killer with a badge.

670
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,690
<12-87,MONTGOMERY>我们晚点再讨论直接命令是什么意思
<12-87,MONTGOMERY>We'll talk about the definition of a direct order later.

671
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,280
<12-87,MONTGOMERY>现在  我只想知道你发现了什么
<12-87,MONTGOMERY>Right now, I just want to hear what you found.

672
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,540
<12-88,BECKETT>好的  到目前为止我们知道
<12-88,BECKETT>Okay, so here's what we know so far--

673
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,330
<12-88,BECKETT>十九年前  拉格兰和至少两位警察
<12-88,BECKETT>19 years ago, Raglan and at least 2 other cops

674
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:24,080
<12-88,BECKETT>为了赎金而绑架黑帮成员
<12-88,BECKETT>were kidnapping mobsters for ransom.

675
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,830
<12-88,BECKETT>当他们试着抓走
<12-88,BECKETT>Things went south when they

676
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,340
<12-88,BECKETT>乔·布伽地的时候场面失去控制
<12-88,BECKETT>tried to snatch Joe Pulgatti.

677
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,410
<12-89,CASTLE>他们误杀了卧底探员
<12-89,CASTLE>They mistakenly killed an undercover fed

678
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,100
<12-89,CASTLE>-鲍勃·阿门  -为了自保
<12-89,CASTLE>- named Bob Armen.  - To cover their asses,

679
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,160
<12-89,CASTLE>他们将阿门的谋杀案嫁祸给布伽地
<12-89,CASTLE>They pinned Armen's murder on Pulgatti.

680
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,120
<12-90,BECKETT>而七年后
<12-90,BECKETT>And then seven years later,

681
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,220
<12-90,BECKETT>我母亲和她的同事们
<12-90,BECKETT>my mom and a group of her colleagues

682
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,760
<12-90,BECKETT>为了帮布伽地上诉而追查真相
<12-90,BECKETT>tried to put together an appeal for Pulgatti.

683
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,130
<12-90,BECKETT>那些警察们知道如果案子被翻审
<12-90,BECKETT>Now the cops knew that if the case got overturned,

684
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,230
<12-90,BECKETT>他们的勾当就会曝光
<12-90,BECKETT>They would all be exposed.

685
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,900
<12-90,BECKETT>于是他们雇迪克·库南杀了所有人
<12-90,BECKETT>So they hired Dick Coonan to kill all of them.

686
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,190
<12-91,MONTGOMERY>而拉格兰将他们的杀人案
<12-91,MONTGOMERY>And Raglan wrote off their homicides

687
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,530
<12-91,MONTGOMERY>归于随机的暴力案件
<12-91,MONTGOMERY>as random gang violence.

688
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,230
<12-92,CASTLE>还不止这些
<12-92,CASTLE>And that would've been the end of it,

689
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,010
<12-92,CASTLE>拉格兰发现自己将要死了
<12-92,CASTLE>But Raglan found out he was dying,

690
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,840
<12-92,CASTLE>决定坦白招供
<12-92,CASTLE>decided he wanted to come clean.

691
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,410
<12-92,CASTLE>所以他们必须将他灭口
<12-92,CASTLE>So they had to silence him, too.

692
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,640
<12-93,BECKETT>布伽地说货车上有三个绑架犯
<12-93,BECKETT>Pulgatti said that there were three kidnappers in that van.

693
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,310
<12-93,BECKETT>表示至少还有两个在逍遥法外
<12-93,BECKETT>That means there's at least two conspirators out there now.

694
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,590
<12-94,RYAN>而我们知道了其中一个是
<12-94,RYAN>And we already know who one of 'em is--

695
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,320
<12-94,RYAN>拉格兰的老同学  盖瑞·麦卡利斯特
<12-94,RYAN>Raglan's old academy buddy, Gary Mccallister.

696
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,510
<12-95,MONTGOMERY>你怎么知道的
<12-95,MONTGOMERY>How you know that?

697
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,150
<12-96,ESPOSITO>我找到了当时的警力调度记录
<12-96,ESPOSITO>I pulled the dispatcher's log from the archives.

698
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,530
<12-96,ESPOSITO>拉格兰逮捕布伽地时
<12-96,ESPOSITO>There was another unit backing Raglan

699
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,870
<12-96,ESPOSITO>还有有另一个警员在场
<12-96,ESPOSITO>when he arrested Pulgatti--

700
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,830
<12-96,ESPOSITO>那就是机动巡逻警员盖瑞·麦卡利斯特
<12-96,ESPOSITO>A one-man patrol unit-- officer Gary Mccallister.

701
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,830
<12-97,MONTGOMERY>捉住那个畜牲
<12-97,MONTGOMERY>Get that son of a bitch.

702
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,000
<12-98,BECKETT>瓦肯·西蒙斯跟这事没有任何关系
<12-98,BECKETT>Vulcan Simmons had nothing to do with this.

703
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,380
<12-98,BECKETT>但身为退休警员  你知道他是完美的嫌犯
<12-98,BECKETT>But as a former cop, you knew that he fit the part,

704
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,690
<12-98,BECKETT>于是你利用他摆脱我们
<12-98,BECKETT>And so you used him throw us off

705
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,450
<12-98,BECKETT>但事实上你跟拉格兰
<12-98,BECKETT>when the truth is that you and Raglan

706
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,590
<12-98,BECKETT>都参与了谋杀和绑架
<12-98,BECKETT>were up to your necks in murder and kidnappings.

707
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,940
<12-98,BECKETT>听着  你现在推断起来好像很容易
<12-98,BECKETT>Listen, it's easy for you to sit in judgment now,

708
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,460
<12-99,BECKETT>但你不在现场
<12-99,BECKETT>but you weren't there.

709
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,990
<12-99,BECKETT>我们做了我们应该做的事
<12-99,BECKETT>We did what we thought we had to do.

710
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,890
<12-100,CASTLE>而且你们做了可不少
<12-100,CASTLE>And you did plenty.

711
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,480
<12-100,CASTLE>绑架  掩盖真相
<12-100,CASTLE>Kidnapping, cover-ups.

712
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,730
<12-101,BECKETT>你杀了联邦警员  然后嫁祸给布伽地
<12-101,BECKETT>You killed a fed, and then you pinned it on Pulgatti.

713
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,890
<12-82,CASTLE>让我告诉你乔·布伽地的为人
<12-82,CASTLE>You want me to tell you about Joe Pulgatti,

714
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,380
<12-63,BECKETT>多少人因为他被送进医院
<12-63,BECKETT>About the people he put in the hospital,

715
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,190
<12-45,CHAD>还有那些被他丢下河的人
<12-45,CHAD>The ones he put in the river?

716
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,420
<12-26,BECKETT>他和他的手下
<12-26,BECKETT>He and the rest of those jackals

717
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,290
<12-7,CASTLE>在城市里胡作非为几十年
<12-7,CASTLE>fed on this city for decades,

718
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,010
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>但你不能制裁他们
<12-23,MONTGOMERY>But you couldn't touch them

719
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,670
<12-39,RYAN>因为他们买通了所有人
<12-39,RYAN>because they bought everybody.

720
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,590
<12-56,CASTLE>还有  我想让你知道的
<12-56,CASTLE>And this part--this part I want you to know,

721
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,540
<12-72,CASTLE>因为我对这不感到惭愧
<12-72,CASTLE>'cause this part I'm not ashamed of,

722
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,840
<12-88,BECKETT>因为至少我们有尝试过
<12-88,BECKETT>'cause at least we tried to do something.

723
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,710
<12-4,BECKETT>这不光彩也不合法  但这是正确的
<12-4,BECKETT>It wasn't pretty and it wasn't legal, but it was right.

724
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,120
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>为了赎金而绑架别人是正确的吗
<12-27,MONTGOMERY>Kidnapping people for ransom was right?

725
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,970
<12-28,RYAN>我们叫这拘留
<12-28,RYAN>We called it incarceration.

726
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,350
<4-4,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>没错  我们从街上抓走他们
<4-4,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yeah, we grabbed 'em off the street,

727
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,770
<12-38,CHAD>带去某个地方然后好好调教一下
<12-38,CHAD>and we'd take them somewhere and we'd tune them up.

728
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,640
<12-39,RYAN>我们让他们吓得屁滚尿流  至少有好一会儿
<12-39,RYAN>We put the fear of god into 'em, at least for a while.

729
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,140
<12-37,RYAN>但我们知道不能永远关着他们
<12-37,RYAN>But we knew we couldn't hold 'em forever.

730
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,170
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>所以我们设了保释金
<12-34,CHAD RODRICK>So we set bail.

731
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,580
<12-32,RYAN>而且我告诉你  赎金相当高
<12-32,RYAN>And I'm here to tell you that we set it high.

732
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,570
<12-30,RYAN>如果那些混蛋想回到街上
<12-30,RYAN>If those bastards wanted back on the street,

733
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,340
<14-2,ESPOSITO>他们必须有所付出
<14-2,ESPOSITO>they were gonna have to pay for their way.

734
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,710
<12-102,CASTLE>当我母亲为布伽地的上诉做调查时
<12-102,CASTLE>When my mom put together that appeal for Pulgatti,

735
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,280
<12-103,BECKETT>你担心她会找上你
<12-103,BECKETT>you got worried that she'd get on to you,

736
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,270
<12-103,BECKETT>-所以你雇了迪克·库南去杀害她  -不
<12-103,BECKETT>- and so you hired Dick Coonan to kill her. - No.

737
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,910
<12-104,CASTLE>然后当拉格兰良心发现
<12-104,CASTLE>And then when Raglan grew a conscience,

738
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,300
<12-104,CASTLE>-你也把他杀了  -不
<12-104,CASTLE>- You had him killed, too. - No.

739
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,590
<12-104,CASTLE>我跟那事没有关系
<12-104,CASTLE>I didn't have anything to do with that.

740
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,020
<12-104,CASTLE>那个  那是其他人干的
<12-104,CASTLE>That was... That was somebody else.

741
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,130
<12-105,BECKETT>-谁  -你永远也碰不到他
<12-105,BECKETT>- Who? - Somebody you'll never touch.

742
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,990
<12-105,BECKETT>是谁
<12-105,BECKETT>Who?

743
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,130
<9-2,CASTLE>你不明白  探长
<9-2,CASTLE>You don't understand, detective.

744
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,770
<9-3,MARTHA>你把恶魔唤醒了
<9-3,MARTHA>You woke the dragon.

745
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:03,950
<8-39,ESPOSITO>这事比你想象中要严重得多
<8-39,ESPOSITO>And this is so much bigger than you realize.

746
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,020
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>我说完了
<8-40,MONTGOMERY>And I'm done talking.

747
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,550
<8-41,RYAN>我要请律师
<8-41,RYAN>I want a lawyer.

748
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,880
<8-42,ESPOSITO>他害怕某人  而那人不是警察
<8-42,ESPOSITO>He's afraid of someone, and it's not a cop.

749
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,730
<8-43,MONTGOMERY>我们要找到那个枪手
<8-43,MONTGOMERY>We gotta find that shooter.

750
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,140
<12-108,RYAN>我想我们找到线索了
<12-108,RYAN>I think we got a lead on him.

751
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,760
<12-109,ESPOSITO>据罗迪克所说
<12-109,ESPOSITO>According to Rodrick,

752
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,780
<12-109,ESPOSITO>我们在洛克伍德的商务套房里
<12-109,ESPOSITO>a woman named Jolene

753
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,260
<12-109,ESPOSITO>找到的那些药片  是一个
<12-109,ESPOSITO>bought those capsules that we found

754
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,200
<12-110,CASTLE>-叫卓琳的女人从他那买的  -女朋友吗
<12-110,CASTLE>- in Lockwood's corporate suite.  - Girlfriend?

755
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,970
<12-111,RYAN>可能吧  我们只知道她是个金发女郎
<12-111,RYAN>Probably. All we got is blonde,

756
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,080
<12-111,RYAN>三十多岁  住在布鲁克林
<12-111,RYAN>30s, lives in Brooklyn.

757
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,030
<12-111,RYAN>所以我们把她的特征
<12-111,RYAN>So we fed her descriptors

758
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,500
<12-111,RYAN>输到车管所的数据库里进行查找
<12-111,RYAN>into the DMV database.

759
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,170
<12-111,RYAN>查找结果缩小到了两个女人
<12-111,RYAN>Got it narrowed down to two women --

760
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,120
<12-111,RYAN>卓琳·格兰杰和卓琳·安德斯
<12-111,RYAN>Jolene Granger and Jolene Anders.

761
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,780
<12-112,BECKETT>你们俩去找卓琳·安德斯
<12-112,BECKETT>Okay, you guys take Jolene Anders.

762
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,220
<12-112,BECKETT>我们去找格兰杰  找到她以后打电话给我
<12-112,BECKETT>We'll take Granger. You call me when you get her.

763
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,660
<12-113,ESPOSITO>遵命
<12-113,ESPOSITO>Roger that.

764
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
<13-1,BECKETT>卓琳·格兰杰  我们是纽约警局的
<13-1,BECKETT>Jolene Granger, NYPD.

765
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,730
<13-1,BECKETT>卓琳
<13-1,BECKETT>Jolene?

766
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,390
<13-5,BECKETT>我是埃斯波西托
<13-5,BECKETT>Esposito.

767
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,680
<13-3,BECKETT>卓琳·格兰杰死了
<13-3,BECKETT>Jolene Granger is dead.

768
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,000
<13-4,ESPOSITO>我们这就过去  走吧
<13-4,ESPOSITO>We're on our way. Let's go.

769
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,670
<13-5,BECKETT>捂上耳朵
<13-5,BECKETT>Cover your ears!

770
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,540
<13-5,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  埃斯波西托
<13-5,BECKETT>Esposito? Esposito?!

771
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,970
<13-6,BECKETT>你查到什么了
<13-6,BECKETT>So what do you got?

772
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,390
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>你所听到的是闪光弹的声音
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>What you heard was a flash bang.

773
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,600
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>他俩肯定在洛克伍德手上
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>Lockwood must've grabbed 'em.

774
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,030
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>我们目前找到的唯一东西就是他们的手机
<13-7,MONTGOMERY>Only thing we've recovered so far are their cell phones.

775
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,600
<13-8,BECKETT>他怕我们用全球定位系统追踪他们的位置
<13-8,BECKETT>He dumped both of their phones,

776
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,180
<13-8,BECKETT>于是把他们俩的手机都丢了
<13-8,BECKETT>so we can't GPS track 'em.

777
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,670
<13-9,CASTLE>我们也找不到卓琳的手机
<13-9,CASTLE>We couldn't find Jolene's cell phone either.

778
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,030
<13-9,CASTLE>肯定也被洛克伍德给扔了
<13-9,CASTLE>Lockwood must have gotten rid of it.

779
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,760
<13-10,BECKETT>因为我们可以通过她的手机找到他
<13-10,BECKETT>Because her phone was a link to him.

780
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,490
<13-10,BECKETT>她用手机给他打过电话
<13-10,BECKETT>She called him on it.

781
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,110
<13-11,CASTLE>她家里肯定会有手机账单
<13-11,CASTLE>There's gotta be a cell phone bill around here somewhere.

782
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,010
<13-11,CASTLE>我要恭喜你们两个
<13-11,CASTLE>I want to congratulate you both.

783
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,340
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>我不知道你们是怎么找到我家的
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>I don't know how you found my place,

784
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,820
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>但是我做这行也做了很久了
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>but I've been doing this kind of work for a while now,

785
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,950
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>从来没人如此接近过我
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>and no one's ever come that close to me.

786
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,960
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>现在的问题就是  你们的调查
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>My problem is that your investigation

787
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,700
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>比我预期的要深入
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>has gone further than I expected.

788
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,820
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>为了能够完成我的任务
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>And now in order for me to finish my job,

789
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,720
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>我需要知道你们对我和我的雇主
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>I need to know exactly what you know about me

790
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,310
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>到底有多少了解
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>and my employer.

791
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,770
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>我很尊重你们两个
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>Now I got a lot of respect for you guys.

792
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,790
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>干嘛  我是说真的
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>What? I do.

793
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,460
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>所以我要跟你们做个交易
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>Now I'm gonna make you a deal.

794
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,220
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>你们把我想知道的事情告诉我
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>You tell me what I need to know,

795
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>咱们来个专业人士间的对话
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>one pro to another,

796
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,740
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>那么我就给你们脑袋来一枪
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>and I will put

797
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,580
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>让你们死得痛快点
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>bullet in your brain.

798
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,890
<14-2,ESPOSITO>要是你们不说
<14-2,ESPOSITO>You don't,

799
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,580
<14-3,RYAN>或是你们敢耍我
<14-3,RYAN>you jerk me around,

800
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,690
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>那今夜对你们来说将是漫漫长夜
<14-1,HAL LOCKWOOD>and you will be begging me to before this night is up.

801
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,450
<14-2,ESPOSITO>我选后者
<14-2,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna have to go with option "B".

802
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,410
<14-3,RYAN>说的对
<14-3,RYAN>Oh, yeah.

803
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,330
<14-3,RYAN>我们绝对会好好耍耍你
<14-3,RYAN>We're definitely gonna jerk you around.

804
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,270
<14-3,RYAN>她的账号是多少
<14-3,RYAN>What's her account number?

805
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,710
<15-1,CASTLE>5892-639-1199
<15-1,CASTLE>5892-639-1199.

806
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,020
<15-3,CASTLE>好了  如果我们能查出她母亲的娘家姓
<15-3,CASTLE>All right. If we can figure out her mother's maiden name,

807
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,450
<15-3,CASTLE>他们就会把密码通过电邮发给我们
<15-3,CASTLE>they'll e-mail us the password.

808
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,290
<15-4,BECKETT>你们去好好查一下卓琳·格兰杰的资料
<15-4,BECKETT>I need everything you can get on Jolene Granger,

809
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,040
<15-4,BECKETT>特别是她母亲的娘家姓
<15-4,BECKETT>specifically her mother's maiden name.

810
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,190
<15-4,BECKETT>给爷爷听好了  龟孙子
<15-4,BECKETT>Listen, ass clown,

811
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,940
<16-1,RYAN>我在教会学校待了十二年
<16-1,RYAN>I was in catholic school for 12 years.

812
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,700
<16-1,RYAN>我以前上课讲话  他们就这样罚我
<16-1,RYAN>Hell. They used to do this to me for talking in cla --

813
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,380
<16-2,ESPOSITO>你死定了  洛克伍德
<16-2,ESPOSITO>You're dead, Lockwood.

814
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,380
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>开始的时候  每个人都会虚张声势
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>You know, they always start off with bravado.

815
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,040
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>待会有你们求饶的时候  这池子里是冰水
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>The begging comes later. See, this is ice cold water.

816
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,180
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>冰水进到他肺里的时候会产生剧烈的灼烧感
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>It'll burn like hell when it hits his lungs,

817
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,000
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>但是他不会马上失去知觉
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>but he won't lose consciousness right away.

818
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,030
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>但是只要你告诉我  警察查到了什么
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>But all this stops when you tell me

819
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,050
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>我就会放过他
<16-3,LOCKWOOD>how much the cops know!

820
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,820
<16-4,CASTLE>她打的最后几个电话里
<16-4,CASTLE>Lockwood would've been one of the

821
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,710
<16-4,CASTLE>肯定有一个是洛克伍德的号码
<16-4,CASTLE>last numbers she called.

822
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,260
<16-5,BECKETT>找到了
<16-5,BECKETT>Uh, got it.

<16-5,BECKETT>Uh, 917-555-0176

824

<16-6,CASTLE>-追踪一下这个号码  -卡塞尔  你又破案了
<16-6,CASTLE>- I need a GPS track.  - Castle, you've done it again.

825
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:24,750
<16-6,CASTLE>这家伙肯定大老远地就能看到特警队
<16-6,CASTLE>That guy is gonna spot a SWAT team

826
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,440
<17-1,BECKETT>然后通知洛克伍德
<17-1,BECKETT>from a block away, warn Lockwood.

827
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,750
<17-1,BECKETT>我们要是动用装甲部队的话  他俩就死定了
<17-1,BECKETT>We call in the cavalry, and they're both dead.

828
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,480
<17-1,BECKETT>我黔驴技穷了
<17-1,BECKETT>I'm open to dumb ideas here.

829
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,400
<17-2,CASTLE>正好  我有个主意
<17-2,CASTLE>Good. 'Cause I got one.

830
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,870
<17-3,BECKETT>他不信  卡塞尔
<17-3,BECKETT>He's not buying it, Castle.

831
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,000
<17-4,CASTLE>感觉棒极了
<17-4,CASTLE>That was amazing.

832
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,550
<17-4,CASTLE>我是说  你刚刚打他那下
<17-4,CASTLE>The -- the way you knocked him out, I mean.

833
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,490
<17-4,CASTLE>那真是
<17-4,CASTLE>It was...

00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,370
<17-5,BECKETT>好吧
<17-5,BECKETT>Okay!

836
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,950

<18-2,RYAN>Ohh. Don't tell this jack hole anything.

837
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,900
<18-3,ESPOSITO>对不起  兄弟  我看不下去了
<18-3,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry, bro. I can't watch this.

<18-3,ESPOSITO>警察已经知道我干了你妈
<18-3,ESPOSITO>The cops already know all about me and your mom.

840
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
<18-4,LOCKWOOD>打碎他一个膝盖
<18-4,LOCKWOOD>Shoot out one of his kneecaps.

00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,810
<19-1,BECKETT>你的手怎么样
<19-1,BECKETT>How's the hand?

848
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,840
<19-2,CASTLE>疼得要死
<19-2,CASTLE>Uh, excruciating.

849
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,120
<19-4,CASTLE>莱恩和埃斯波西托怎么样了
<19-4,CASTLE>How's Ryan and Esposito?

850
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,830
<19-5,BECKETT>体温有些过低  自尊心受损
<19-5,BECKETT>Mm, mild hypothermia...wounded pride.

851
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,410
<19-5,BECKETT>猜猜看哪个会先好起来
<19-5,BECKETT>Guess which one will heal first.

852
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,560
<19-5,BECKETT>谢谢你
<19-5,BECKETT>Thank you...

853
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,140
<19-5,BECKETT>刚才做我的后援
<19-5,BECKETT>for having my back in there.

854
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,250
<19-6,CASTLE>随时效劳
<19-6,CASTLE>Always.

855
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,610
<20-1,BECKETT>我们把你登记为无名氏
<20-1,BECKETT>We booked you as John Doe.

856
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,810
<20-1,BECKETT>你真名绝对不是哈尔·洛克伍德
<20-1,BECKETT>You sure as hell aren't Hal Lockwood.

857
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,870
<20-1,BECKETT>是谁雇的你
<20-1,BECKETT>Who hired you?

858
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,320
<20-1,BECKETT>我曾将很多人送进这里
<20-1,BECKETT>I put a lot of people in this place.

859
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,370
<20-1,BECKETT>其中一些人想要杀我
<20-1,BECKETT>Some of them want to kill me.

860
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,830
<20-1,BECKETT>而其他人  这辈子从未受过这么公正的待遇
<20-1,BECKETT>Others, never been treated so fairly in their lives.

861
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,050
<20-1,BECKETT>所以他们对我产生了一种感情
<20-1,BECKETT>So they form this attachment to me.

862
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,570
<20-1,BECKETT>把我看做了他们最喜爱的老师
<20-1,BECKETT>It's like I'm their favorite schoolteacher.

863
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,100
<20-1,BECKETT>你在这所监狱的这段时间里
<20-1,BECKETT>Some of those people might visit you

864
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,680
<20-1,BECKETT>他们其中的一些人可能会探望一下你
<20-1,BECKETT>while you're in here...

865
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:11,390
<20-1,BECKETT>就像是缠着史顾己的那些鬼魂一样
<20-1,BECKETT>like the ghosts that visit Scrooge.

867
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,260
<20-1,BECKETT>跟他们相处一段时间以后
<20-1,BECKETT>And after some time with them,

868
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,040
<20-1,BECKETT>你也许会发现  自己变成了一个崭新的人
<20-1,BECKETT>you might find yourself a changed man.

869
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,210
<20-1,BECKETT>所以我会每个礼拜
<20-1,BECKETT>So I will be back here

870
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:24,200
<20-1,BECKETT>都到这来
<20-1,BECKETT>week after week

871
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,090
<20-1,BECKETT>问你到底是谁雇了你
<20-1,BECKETT>to ask you who hired you...

872
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,850
<20-1,BECKETT>直到奇迹发生的那天
<20-1,BECKETT>until that miracle occurs.
