00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,430
<1-1,REGINALD EASLEY>希斯顿先生  一切都还好吧
<1-1,REGINALD EASLEY>Mr. Hixton, is everything all right?

2
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,960
<1-1,REGINALD EASLEY>希斯顿先生
<1-1,REGINALD EASLEY>Mr. Hixton?

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,750
<2-1,CASTLE>快杀了我吧
<2-1,CASTLE>Kill me now.

4
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,980
<2-2,ALEXIS>你收到手机话费单了
<2-2,ALEXIS>You got the cell phone bill?

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,710
<2-2,ALEXIS>没有
<2-2,ALEXIS>No.

6
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,820
<2-3,CASTLE>是我的出版商要我写封底评论的书
<2-3,CASTLE>Uh, books from my publisher for back cover quotes.

7
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,710
<2-3,CASTLE>等等  手机话费单是怎么回事
<2-3,CASTLE>Wait. What about the cell phone bill?

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,590
<2-4,ALEXIS>没事啊
<2-4,ALEXIS>Nothing.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,930
<2-5,MARTHA>啊  又来一批要评论的书啊
<2-5,MARTHA>Ah, more books to endorse.

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,180
<2-5,MARTHA>你怎么可能看得完呢
<2-5,MARTHA>You couldn't possibly read them all.

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,390
<2-6,CASTLE>没必要看完
<2-6,CASTLE>Don't have to.

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,980
<2-7,CASTLE>"又一惊悚力作  理查德·卡塞尔"
<2-7,CASTLE>"A tour de force in terror. Richard Castle."

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,100
<2-8,CASTLE>"此书之于按摩浴池  有如《大白鲨》之于大海"
<2-8,CASTLE>"Does for hot tubs what 'Jaws' did for the ocean."

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,780
<2-9,ALEXIS>奶奶  这有你的信  样式很正式
<2-9,ALEXIS>Gram, there's a letter for you. Looks official.

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,770
<2-9,ALEXIS>巴克曼塞巴斯图律师事务所
<2-9,ALEXIS>"Bachman & Sabasto"?

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,810
<2-10,MARTHA>是切特的房产律师
<2-10,MARTHA>Oh. Chet's estate lawyer.

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,760
<2-10,MARTHA>他们可能走完了遗嘱认证程序
<2-10,MARTHA>They probably resolved the probate.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,370
<2-11,CASTLE>你还好吧
<2-11,CASTLE>You okay?

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,570
<2-12,MARTHA>这封他的遗嘱突然勾起了我的思念
<2-12,MARTHA>This memory of him caught me by surprise.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,830
<2-13,ALEXIS>你觉得他在遗嘱中有留东西给你吗
<2-13,ALEXIS>Do you think he left you anything in his will?

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,400
<2-14,MARTHA>其实他没必要留什么给我  但如果...
<2-14,MARTHA>Well, he certainly didn't need to, but if...

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,640
<2-15,MARTHA>天啊
<2-15,MARTHA>Oh, my.

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,510
<2-16,CASTLE>妈  怎么了
<2-16,CASTLE>Mother, what's wrong?

24
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,460
<2-16,CASTLE>我...
<2-16,CASTLE>I...

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,300
<2-16,CASTLE>一百万
<2-16,CASTLE>$1 million?

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,220
<3-1,BECKETT>你妈妈肯定很震惊
<3-1,BECKETT>Your mom must be in shock.

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,010
<3-1,BECKETT>知道她会怎么处理这笔钱吗
<3-1,BECKETT>Any idea what she's gonna do with it?

28
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,870
<3-2,CASTLE>如果我够走运  她会为自己置一套房
<3-2,CASTLE>If I'm lucky, get a place of her own.

29
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,920
<3-3,BECKETT>要是真能买到就走大运了
<3-3,BECKETT>Yeah, that would be lucky.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,540
<3-3,BECKETT>一百万美金在曼哈顿能买到什么房产啊
<3-3,BECKETT>You can't buy much in Manhattan for 1 million bucks.

31
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,010
<3-3,BECKETT>哇
<3-3,BECKETT>Wow.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,050
<3-3,BECKETT>桌上足球  篮球架  摩托车
<3-3,BECKETT>Foosball, basketball, a motorcycle--

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,970
<3-3,BECKETT>我敢说这公寓的业主
<3-3,BECKETT>I'll bet the owner of this place

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,730
<4-1,CASTLE>身家肯定有一千万
<4-1,CASTLE>clearly had ten times that.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,280
<4-2,ESPOSITO>应该是一亿
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Try a hundred.

36
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,620
<4-2,ESPOSITO>死者名叫杰·希斯顿
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Victim's name is Jay Hixton.

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,850
<4-2,ESPOSITO>他去年在佛罗里达州
<4-2,ESPOSITO>He won a cool $117 mil

38
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,500
<4-2,ESPOSITO>中了一亿一千七百万彩票
<4-2,ESPOSITO>in the Florida lottery last year.

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,180
<4-3,CASTLE>随后他就去了疯狂大购物
<4-3,CASTLE>And then he went on a serious shopping spree.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,140
<4-3,CASTLE>绝对是低级错误
<4-3,CASTLE>Rookie mistake.

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,640
<4-4,BECKETT>听起来是你的经验之谈啊
<4-4,BECKETT>Sounds like the voice of experience.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
<4-4,BECKETT>嗯  大学期间写出一本畅销书
<4-4,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Writing a best seller in college

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,610
<4-5,CASTLE>就跟赢彩票一样
<4-5,CASTLE>is a lot like winning the lottery.

44
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,360
<4-5,CASTLE>我六个月就把钱花光了
<4-5,CASTLE>I spent every penny of it in six months.

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,820
<4-5,CASTLE>还好我不是昙花一现的作家
<4-5,CASTLE>Good thing I'm not a one-hit wonder.

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,270
<4-6,LANIE>胸部中了一枪
<4-6,LANIE>Single gunshot to the chest.

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,210
<4-6,LANIE>从火药残余颗粒沉着和瘀伤来看
<4-6,LANIE>From the stippling and bruising,

48
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,300
<4-6,LANIE>我敢说死者有反抗过
<4-6,LANIE>I'd say there was a struggle,

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,390
<4-6,LANIE>枪支走火了  射中了他的心脏
<4-6,LANIE>the gun went off, vaporized his heart,

50
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,990
<4-6,LANIE>死亡时间大概是昨晚11点至2点间
<4-6,LANIE>somewhere between 11:00 and 2:00 last night.

51
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,990
<4-7,BECKETT>这把枪口径太大  与射入伤不吻合
<4-7,BECKETT>That's a big gun. It's too big for that entry wound.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,950
<4-7,BECKETT>这把枪不是凶器
<4-7,BECKETT>This isn't the murder weapon.

53
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,080
<4-8,LANIE>就说过她会第一时间发现
<4-8,LANIE>Told you she'd spot it first off.

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,990
<4-8,LANIE>射杀死者的凶器是把9毫米自动手枪
<4-8,LANIE>Our victim was shot with a 9-millimeter automatic.

55
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,970
<4-8,LANIE>子弹直接穿膛而出
<4-8,LANIE>The bullet went straight through him.

56
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,400
<4-8,LANIE>我们从扑克桌上拔出了子弹
<4-8,LANIE>We pulled the slug out of the poker table.

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,510
<4-9,BECKETT>所以凶手可能是逼着希斯顿去打开保险箱
<4-9,BECKETT>Okay, so maybe our killer forces Hixton to open the safe,

58
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,170
<4-9,BECKETT>这个宽357毫米的保险箱藏在墙里
<4-9,BECKETT>The .357 is hidden inside.

59
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,840
<4-9,BECKETT>希斯顿把它打开  后来他们发生了争执
<4-9,BECKETT>Hixton pulls it out, they struggle,

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,530
<4-9,BECKETT>-然后他中枪倒地  -这就是中了奖的彩票
<4-9,BECKETT>- and he gets shot. - That's the winning ticket.

61
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,380
<4-10,ESPOSITO>真是难以想象这一小张纸价值竟超过一亿
<4-10,ESPOSITO>Hard to believe a little slip of paper is worth over $100 mil.

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,440
<4-11,CASTLE>要是你中了彩票你会怎么花
<4-11,CASTLE>What would you do if you won that kind of money?

63
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
<4-12,ESPOSITO>简单  买一辆法拉利
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Easy. Buy a Ferrari.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,950
<4-13,CASTLE>我有一辆  其实没你想得那么好
<4-13,CASTLE>I have one. Not as great as you would think.

65
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,950
<4-14,ESPOSITO>但它们胜在速度够快
<4-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but they're hella fast.

66
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,210
<4-15,CASTLE>交通尖峰时段速度跟其他车没差
<4-15,CASTLE>Fast as every other car in rush-hour traffic.

67
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,770
<4-16,BECKETT>知道箱里面装了多少钱吗
<4-16,BECKETT>Any idea how much money was in here?

68
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,660
<4-17,EASLEY>十万元  保管在银行袋里
<4-17,EASLEY>$100,000, secured in a bank bag.

69
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,690
<4-18,RYAN>这位是雷金纳德·伊斯利
<4-18,RYAN>Uh, this is Reginald Easley.

70
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,240
<4-18,RYAN>他是希斯顿先生的仆人
<4-18,RYAN>He's Mr. Hixton's servant.

71
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,080
<4-19,EASLEY>仆人  年轻人  我可是传统的英式管家
<4-19,EASLEY>Servant? Young man, I am a traditional english butler.

72
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,100
<4-19,EASLEY>我受训于白金汉宫[英国皇宫]
<4-19,EASLEY>I apprenticed at buckingham palace.

73
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,960
<4-20,BECKETT>他的保险箱里总是放着那么多现金吗
<4-20,BECKETT>Did he always keep that much hard cash in the safe?

74
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,740
<4-21,EASLEY>希斯顿以前家境贫困
<4-21,EASLEY>Mr. Hixton came from an impoverished background.

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,480
<4-21,EASLEY>他觉得把钱放在身边较有安全感
<4-21,EASLEY>He found having hard currency around reassuring.

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,890
<4-22,BECKETT>有多少人知道钱放在那里
<4-22,BECKETT>How many people knew that it was there?

77
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,080
<4-23,EASLEY>知情者无疑不少
<4-23,EASLEY>Dozens, no doubt.

78
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,160
<4-23,EASLEY>他购物习惯看到就买下
<4-23,EASLEY>He had a habit of buying everything in sight,

79
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,100
<4-23,EASLEY>从不考虑自己亮出了多少钱
<4-23,EASLEY>no thought to how much money he was flashing around

80
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,400
<4-23,EASLEY>也不考虑让他人得知
<4-23,EASLEY>or how dangerous it was to tell people

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,210
<4-23,EASLEY>家里藏有更多钱会有多危险
<4-23,EASLEY>that there was plenty more of it at home.

82
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,240
<4-24,CASTLE>在纽约  那就等同于
<4-24,CASTLE>In New York, that's like

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,600
<4-24,CASTLE>邀请别人尾随你回家来杀你
<4-24,CASTLE>inviting someone back to your house to kill you.

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,520
<4-25,BECKETT>那把枪是他收在保险箱里的吗
<4-25,BECKETT>Did he keep that gun in the safe?

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,710
<4-26,EASLEY>小姐  这点很奇怪
<4-26,EASLEY>That's the odd thing, miss.

86
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,510
<4-26,EASLEY>我熟悉这公寓里的每一件物品
<4-26,EASLEY>I know every item in this apartment.

87
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,450
<4-26,EASLEY>但却从未在此见过一把枪
<4-26,EASLEY>I have never seen a gun.

88
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,340
<4-26,EASLEY>但我知道他在失窃的袋子里
<4-26,EASLEY>Oh, but I do know he kept a dye pack

89
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,390
<4-26,EASLEY>放了一叠自爆染色钞票
<4-26,EASLEY>in the bag that was stolen.

90
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,430
<4-27,BECKETT>那它会怎么引爆
<4-27,BECKETT>And how is it triggered?

91
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,040
<4-28,EASLEY>它连着一个三分钟的定时器
<4-28,EASLEY>It was on a 3-minute timer

92
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,510
<4-28,EASLEY>从袋子离开公寓开始计时
<4-28,EASLEY>that began when the bag left the apartment.

93
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,630
<4-29,BECKETT>好的  带上一队警员  彻查这片区域
<4-29,BECKETT>All right, grab some uniforms, canvass the area.

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,900
<4-29,BECKETT>既然钞票还没自爆
<4-29,BECKETT>The killer couldn't have gotten very far

95
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,790
<4-29,BECKETT>凶手肯定还没走远
<4-29,BECKETT>before that pack exploded.

96
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,860
<4-29,BECKETT>你最后一次看到希斯顿是什么时候
<4-29,BECKETT>When was the last time you saw Hixton?

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,860
<4-30,EASLEY>昨晚
<4-30,EASLEY>Yesterday evening.

98
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,560
<4-30,EASLEY>他5点左右出门了
<4-30,EASLEY>He left about 5:00.

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,080
<4-30,EASLEY>我相信他当时与他夫人有约
<4-30,EASLEY>I believe he had made plans with his wife.

100
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,270
<4-31,BECKETT>他已婚了吗
<4-31,BECKETT>He was married?

101
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,400
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>对的  有一个十几岁的女儿
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>Oh, yes, with a teenage daughter.

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,870
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>他们在我开始当管家前
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>They'd been separated for some months

103
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,770
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>就已经分居数月了
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>before I began to work for him.

104
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,930
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>显然是金钱导致他们失睦的
<4-32,REGINALD EASLEY>Apparently, the money caused some kind of a rift.

105
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,980
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>我们当时开心极了
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>We were so happy then.

106
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,330
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>去了巴黎  罗马旅行
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>Trips to Paris and trips to Rome and...

107
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,790
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>买了有加热座椅的车子...
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>Cars with heated seats and...

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,580
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>然后大家看我们的眼光就变了
<5-1,NOREEN HIXTON>Then everyone started looking at us different.

109
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,120
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>把我们当怪人看
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>Like we were freaks.

110
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,800
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>你能看出他们的想法
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>You could see them thinking,

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,730
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>"为什么是你中奖  而不是我"
<5-2,NICOLE HIXTON>why you? Why not me?

112
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,950
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>无论我们做什么都是错的
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>And nothing we did was good enough.

113
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,170
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>所以我们搬来了这里
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>So we moved here.

114
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,660
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>理应是个全新的开始
<5-3,NOREEN HIXTON>It was supposed to be a fresh start.

115
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,290
<5-4,BECKETT>那你们为何分居呢
<5-4,BECKETT>Why were the two of you separated?

116
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,470
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>那笔钱简直是...就像是毒药
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>That money, it was... just like poison.

117
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,400
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>杰不由自主地花钱
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>Jay couldn't stop spending it,

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,060
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>而尼可...
<5-5,NOREEN HIXTON>and--and Nicole...

119
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,580
<5-6,NICOLE HIXTON>没关系  妈妈
<5-6,NICOLE HIXTON>It's okay, mom.

120
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,870
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>尼可染上了毒瘾
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>Nicole got hooked on drugs.

121
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,120
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>这事对我们犹如当头棒喝
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>And it was the wake-up call we needed, really.

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>杰和我从无话可说变成合力帮尼可戒毒
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>Jay and I went from not talking to getting Nicole clean.

123
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,190
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>然后他开始把钱用于善事上
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>And then he started using his money for good.

124
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,130
<5-12,BECKETT>他在落后贫困的鲍厄里街
<5-12,BECKETT>He found this soup kitchen on the Bowery

125
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,720
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>鲍厄里街:美国纽约市一条经济萧条的街
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>以低级旅馆  廉价酒吧众多著称

126
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,720
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>找到一家救济处
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>that was in dire straits.

127
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,350
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>他说看着那些需要帮助的人
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>He said that looking at all those people in need

128
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,160
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>让他想起若不是中了彩票
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>just reminded him, if--if it wasn't for that lottery,

129
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,840
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>我们也会是穷人之一
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>we'd be right there ourselves.

130
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,570
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>他开始天天往那里跑
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>He started going there almost every day.

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,470
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>这也让我想起自己是多么...
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>And it just reminded me of how much...

132
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,230
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>多么爱他
<5-7,NOREEN HIXTON>how much I love him.

133
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,300
<5-8,CASTLE>你们俩昨晚最后去了哪里
<5-8,CASTLE>Where was it the two of you ended up going last night?

134
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,360
<5-9,NOREEN HIXTON>昨晚
<5-9,NOREEN HIXTON>Last night?

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,970
<5-10,BECKETT>他的管家说你俩昨晚有约
<5-10,BECKETT>His butler said that the two of you had a date.

136
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,890
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>没有  杰最后一刻打来取消了
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>No. Jay called to cancel at the last minute.

137
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,590
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>他说发生了一些事
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>He told me something had happened,

138
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>需要我们俩一起处理的
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>something that we had to deal with together.

139
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,270
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>然后我试着问出他到底是什么事
<5-11,NOREEN HIXTON>And I tried to get him to tell me what it was,

140
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,400
<5-12,BECKETT>-但他不愿说  -他是在哪里打给你的
<5-12,BECKETT>- but he wouldn't. - And where did he call from?

141
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,760
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>我想是鲍厄里街的救济所吧
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>The bowery soup kitchen, I-I think.

142
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>我们原定就在那里碰面
<5-13,NOREEN HIXTON>It's where we were supposed to meet.

143
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,760
<5-14,BECKETT>他有与哪些你认识的人
<5-14,BECKETT>And did he have problems with anyone

144
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,540
<5-14,BECKETT>发生摩擦吗
<5-14,BECKETT>there that you know of?

145
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,580
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>没特别想起谁
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>No one in particular.

146
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,880
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>他接触的人都很粗俗
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>It was a pretty rough crowd.

147
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,790
<6-1,CASTLE>凭我多年来当推理作家的经验
<6-1,CASTLE>All my years as a mystery writer

148
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,760
<6-1,CASTLE>我敢说凶手只有一人
<6-1,CASTLE>point to one unequivocal killer.

149
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,620
<6-1,CASTLE>-就是那个管家  -是吗
<6-1,CASTLE>- The butler did it. - Oh.

150
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,070
<6-2,BECKETT>你想想  咱们处理过那么多案子
<6-2,BECKETT>Oh, come on. How many cases have we actually had

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,330
<6-3,CASTLE>说真的  有哪桩的疑犯是管家呢
<6-3,CASTLE>where there's a-a butler as a potential suspect?

152
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,810
<6-3,CASTLE>如果不是他干的  那真是没天理啊
<6-3,CASTLE>It would be a crime if he didn't do it.

153
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,720
<6-4,BECKETT>然后他第二天早晨出现了
<6-4,BECKETT>And then he shows up the next morning

154
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,310
<6-4,BECKETT>还报了警
<6-4,BECKETT>and calls the cops?

155
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,460
<6-5,CASTLE>挺高明的  不是吗
<6-5,CASTLE>Pretty clever, right?

156
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,310
<6-5,CASTLE>说到高明  我注意到在犯罪现场
<6-5,CASTLE>Speaking of clever, I noticed at the crime scene,

157
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,050
<6-5,CASTLE>你从没提过要是
<6-5,CASTLE>you never mentioned what you

158
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,430
<6-5,CASTLE>你中了彩票你会怎么用
<6-5,CASTLE>would do if you won the lottery.

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,990
<6-6,BECKETT>我没想过
<6-6,BECKETT>No, I didn't.

160
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,580
<6-7,CASTLE>因为是羞于启齿的事吗  难道是艳事
<6-7,CASTLE>Is that because it's embarrassing? Ooh, scandalous?

161
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,430
<6-8,BECKETT>其实我真的没想过这问题  卡塞尔
<6-8,BECKETT>I actually haven't really thought about it, Castle.

162
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,020
<6-9,CASTLE>所以不是羞事也不是艳事  只是秘事
<6-9,CASTLE>So not embarrassing or scandalous, just secretive.

163
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,040
<6-10,CASTLE>真是坏事传千里
<6-10,CASTLE>Bad news travels fast.

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,050
<7-2,CASTLE>他对待错误态度宽容
<7-2,CASTLE>The man was generous to a fault.

165
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,380
<7-3,BECKETT>当他初次来这里的时候
<7-3,BECKETT>When he first started coming here,

166
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,760
<7-3,BECKETT>他拿出一张100元钞票  仿佛那只是一张纸
<7-3,BECKETT>he'd hand out $100 bills like-- like they were nothing.

167
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,890
<7-3,BECKETT>情况越变越糟  我只得请他收手
<7-3,BECKETT>Got so bad, I had to ask him to stop.

168
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,340
<7-3,BECKETT>-为什么  -我们已经吸引了一些坏分子
<7-3,BECKETT>- Why? - Well, we were attracting a bad element.

169
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,840
<7-2,CASTLE>但我还是看见希斯顿先生偷偷
<7-2,CASTLE>Still, I'd see mr. Hixton sneak money

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,890
<7-2,CASTLE>把钱塞给孕妇或流浪儿童
<7-2,CASTLE>to a pregnant woman or homeless kid.

171
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,910
<7-2,CASTLE>那是一种强迫行为  好像他必须得施舍
<7-2,CASTLE>It was a compulsion for him, like he had to give it away

172
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,960
<7-2,CASTLE>因为自己不配拥有这么多钱
<7-2,CASTLE>'cause he didn't deserve it somehow.

173
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,170
<7-2,CASTLE>赢了也受之有愧
<7-2,CASTLE>Winner's guilt.

174
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,580
<7-2,CASTLE>这事其实在彩票得主身上很常见
<7-2,CASTLE>It's actually quite common with lottery recipients.

175
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,990
<7-3,BECKETT>希斯顿先生昨晚来到这里后
<7-3,BECKETT>Did anything suspicious happen with Mr. Hixton

176
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,390
<7-3,BECKETT>有没有发生什么可疑的事
<7-3,BECKETT>when he was here last night?

177
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,850
<7-3,BECKETT>你这么一说我就想起来了
<7-3,BECKETT>Now that you mention it, yeah.

178
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,370
<7-4,BECKETT>有个男人下午那会一直在附近转悠
<7-4,BECKETT>A man was hanging around a good part of the afternoon.

179
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,780
<7-4,BECKETT>-是你不认识的人吗  -从来没见过
<7-4,BECKETT>- Someone you didn't know? - I'd never seen him before,

180
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,270
<7-4,BECKETT>当希斯顿先生6点来到时
<7-4,BECKETT>but he went right up to Mr. Hixton

181
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,830
<7-4,BECKETT>他便径直走向希斯顿先生
<7-4,BECKETT>when he arrived at 6:00,

182
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,900
<7-5,BECKETT>就好像两人认识似的
<7-5,BECKETT>like he knew him, you know?

183
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,860
<7-5,BECKETT>过了几分钟  他便一走没回头了
<7-5,BECKETT>A few minutes later, he left and never came back.

184
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,460
<7-5,BECKETT>你觉得你能向素描师描述他的样子吗
<7-5,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?

185
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,780
<8-1,CASTLE>所以说神秘男子
<8-1,CASTLE>So our mystery man

186
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,270
<8-1,CASTLE>去了救济所  等候希斯顿
<8-1,CASTLE>goes to the soup kitchen, waits for Hixton,

187
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,030
<8-1,CASTLE>之后把他带去哪了呢
<8-1,CASTLE>and then takes him where?

188
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,510
<8-1,CASTLE>他并非死于之后的6小时内
<8-1,CASTLE>He wasn't killed for another six hours.

189
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,920
<8-2,BECKETT>为什么要等呢  如果这家伙想抢劫希斯顿
<8-2,BECKETT>And why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton,

190
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,210
<8-2,BECKETT>为何不直接押他回家  抢空他的保险箱呢
<8-2,BECKETT>why not just take him home and empty his safe?

191
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,870
<8-3,CASTLE>还有希斯顿的枪有怎么说呢
<8-3,CASTLE>And then there's Hixton's gun.

192
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,240
<8-3,CASTLE>为什么他需要枪  他又是从哪弄来的呢
<8-3,CASTLE>Why did he need it and where did he get it?

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,400
<8-4,BECKETT>根据鉴证人员反馈  枪是从非法途径得来的
<8-4,BECKETT>Well, according to C.S.U., nowhere legal.

194
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,640
<8-4,BECKETT>序列号与枪支对不上号
<8-4,BECKETT>The serial numbers were filed off the gun,

195
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,750
<8-4,BECKETT>而且希斯顿胸部的子弹上有他自己的指纹
<8-4,BECKETT>and Hixton's prints were on the bullets in the chamber,

196
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,370
<8-4,BECKETT>也就是说枪是他亲自上膛的
<8-4,BECKETT>which means he loaded it himself.

197
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,970
<8-5,ESPOSITO>找到彩票得主的钱袋了
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Found our lottery winner's money bag.

198
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,010
<8-6,BECKETT>-你在哪里找到的  -希斯顿那栋楼的后巷
<8-6,BECKETT>- Where'd you find it? - Alley behind Hixton's building.

199
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,190
<8-7,ESPOSITO>袋是空的  但如你所见
<8-7,ESPOSITO>It was empty, but as you can see,

200
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,120
<8-8,BECKETT>袋里的自爆染色钞票爆破了
<8-8,BECKETT>the dye pack in the bag went off.

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,550
<8-7,ESPOSITO>凶手的手一定染上了染料
<8-7,ESPOSITO>And it must have gotten on our killer's hands,

202
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,220
<8-7,ESPOSITO>因为我们找到了指纹
<8-7,ESPOSITO>because we got prints

203
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,260
<8-7,ESPOSITO>一个叫托德·希普利的人留下的
<8-7,ESPOSITO>belonging to one Todd Shipley,

204
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,280
<8-7,ESPOSITO>他是希斯顿那栋楼的维修工
<8-7,ESPOSITO>a maintenance worker in Hixton's building.

205
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,480
<8-7,ESPOSITO>他下班那会  希斯顿刚好就遇害了
<8-7,ESPOSITO>He got off right around the time that Hixton was killed.

206
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
<8-8,BECKETT>但是如果他是维修工的话
<8-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but if he's a maintenance worker,

207
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,840
<8-8,BECKETT>他完全可以等染色钞票
<8-8,BECKETT>he could've picked up the bag

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,290
<8-8,BECKETT>-爆破后再拿钱走人啊  -我想他没那么聪明
<8-8,BECKETT>- after the dye pack went off. - I don't think so.

209
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,070
<8-10,CASTLE>那家伙要么是《阿凡达》的粉丝
<8-10,CASTLE>Either that guy really likes "Avatar"...

210
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,500
<8-11,BECKETT>要么就是本案的凶手
<8-11,BECKETT>Or he's our killer.

211
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,900
<9-1,TODD SHIPLEY>我发誓  我是在地上发现那个袋子的
<9-1,TODD SHIPLEY>I swear. I found the bag on the ground,

212
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,850
<9-1,TODD SHIPLEY>我一打开  袋子便冲着我脸爆炸了
<9-1,TODD SHIPLEY>and when I opened it, it went off in my face.

213
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,530
<9-2,RYAN>那个袋子装了个3分钟定时器
<9-2,RYAN>That bag was on a 3-minute timer.

214
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,890
<9-2,RYAN>你是想告诉我们
<9-2,RYAN>Are you telling us that you

215
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,130
<9-2,RYAN>你刚巧在不恰当的时机无意间捡到了袋子吗
<9-2,RYAN>accidentally picked it up at exactly the wrong time?

216
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,360
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>老兄  我说的都是实话
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>Man, I'm telling the truth.

217
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,660
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>我那时刚下班  想停下买罐汽水
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>I-I had just gotten off work, stopped to get a soda,

218
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,410
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>就看见有一个人从小巷跑了出来
<9-3,TODD SHIPLEY>when I saw someone running out of the alley.

219
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,110
<9-4,RYAN>你说看到有个人跑出来  那人是什么样子的
<9-4,RYAN>This, uh, someone that ran away, what did they look like?

220
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,560
<9-5,TODD SHIPLEY>我不知道  周围很暗
<9-5,TODD SHIPLEY>I-I don't know. It--it was dark.

221
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,580
<9-6,RYAN>托德  如果你再不说实话
<9-6,RYAN>So's your future, Todd,

222
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,990
<9-6,RYAN>那你的未来就危险了
<9-6,RYAN>if you don't start telling us the truth.

223
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,650
<9-7,TODD SHIPLEY>老兄  我句句属实  你去问韩货店的李先生
<9-7,TODD SHIPLEY>Man, I am. Yo, ask Mr. Lee at the korean grocery.

224
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,770
<9-7,TODD SHIPLEY>他就是卖我汽水的人
<9-7,TODD SHIPLEY>He--he--he's the one that sold me the soda.

225
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,700
<9-8,ESPOSITO>定时器设定了3分钟自爆
<9-8,ESPOSITO>Timer was set for three minutes.

226
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,920
<9-8,ESPOSITO>他不可能在
<9-8,ESPOSITO>There's no way he could've

227
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,640
<9-8,ESPOSITO>染色钞票自爆前
<9-8,ESPOSITO>gotten downstairs from the 20th floor

228
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,600
<9-8,ESPOSITO>从20楼下来  还买了罐饮料
<9-8,ESPOSITO>and bought a drink before the dye pack exploded.

229
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,280
<9-8,ESPOSITO>好吧  告诉我  你上班期间有在大楼里
<9-8,ESPOSITO>All right, tell me this--did you see Hixton in the building

230
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,980
<9-8,ESPOSITO>-见过希斯顿吗  -有
<9-8,ESPOSITO>- at all during your shift? - Yeah.

231
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,610
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>他11点左右回到家时我刚好在大堂
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>I was in the lobby when he came home, around 11:00.

232
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,050
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>他满身大汗  好像走路回来似的
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>Uh, he was sweating like he had been walking.

233
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,810
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>看他提前下了凯迪拉克  我便问他
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>And since he left earlier in his Escalade, I asked him

234
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,270
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>他的车在哪里
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>where his car was.

235
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,740
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>他说某人从他那开走了
<9-9,TODD SHIPLEY>He said someone had taken it from him.

236
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,200
<10-1,RYAN>李先生证实了希普利不在场证言
<10-1,RYAN>So Mr. Lee confirmed Shipley's alibi.

237
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,270
<10-1,RYAN>希斯顿的车确实不见了
<10-1,RYAN>And Hixton's car is definitely missing.

238
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,410
<10-2,BECKETT>希斯顿遇害当天
<10-2,BECKETT>Well, it can't be a coincidence

239
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,090
<10-2,BECKETT>车子也不见了  这绝不可能是巧合
<10-2,BECKETT>that on the same day Hixton's car was taken, he was killed.

240
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,550
<10-3,ESPOSITO>凶手可以在抢车那时顺便抢了
<10-3,ESPOSITO>The killer could've gotten Hixton's home key

241
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,500
<10-3,ESPOSITO>希斯顿家的钥匙
<10-3,ESPOSITO>when he took his ride.

242
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,060
<10-4,RYAN>驾照上有家庭地址
<10-4,RYAN>Address was on the registration.

243
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,010
<10-4,RYAN>凶手那么爱这辆车
<10-4,RYAN>He liked the car so much,

244
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,230
<10-4,RYAN>他会开车去抢劫公寓
<10-4,RYAN>he drove over to rob the apartment,

245
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,380
<10-4,RYAN>结果当场被抓包
<10-4,RYAN>got caught in the act.

246
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,450
<10-5,CASTLE>那为何希斯顿要回家呢
<10-5,CASTLE>Yeah, but why would Hixton go home?

247
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,320
<10-5,CASTLE>-他为什么不报警说车子失窃了  -好的
<10-5,CASTLE>- Why wouldn't he call the police, report the theft? - Okay.

248
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,610
<10-6,BECKETT>追踪公司锁定了希斯顿那辆凯迪拉克的位置
<10-6,BECKETT>Tracking company's got a lock on Hixton's Escalade.

249
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,500
<10-6,BECKETT>看来车子正在运河街往西开
<10-6,BECKETT>Looks like it's heading west on Canal Street.

<13-1,BECKETT>And Hixton's signature on the car title is authentic.

<13-4,CASTLE>如果昨晚他用信用卡消费了
<13-4,CASTLE>If he made any charges on his credit card last night,

330
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,670
<13-4,CASTLE>消费单可能帮助我们知道他去哪了
<13-4,CASTLE>it might give us a clue as to where he was.

<14-3,ESPOSITO>这还只是冰山一角
<14-3,ESPOSITO>And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

<14-4,BECKETT>Wow. Sounds like that money really turned Hixton

341
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,550
<14-4,BECKETT>真的是把希斯顿变成了一个不一样的人
<14-4,BECKETT>into a different person for a little while.

342
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,020
<14-5,CASTLE>钱不会改变人的本性
<14-5,CASTLE>Yeah, money doesn't change who you are.

361
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,040
<14-14,RYAN>卡在前座的下面  肯定是希斯顿的
<14-14,RYAN>Lodged under the front seat. Clearly it belongs to Hixton.

362
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,820

<15-3,BECKETT>那我干什么
<15-3,BECKETT>Well, what else would I do?

382
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,340
<15-7,BECKETT>因为没什么可说的
<15-7,BECKETT>Because there's nothing really to tell.

419
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,860
<16-11,CASTLE>为什么我觉得
<16-11,CASTLE>Why is it I'm thinking,

420
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,040
<16-11,CASTLE>希斯顿先生提供的唯一救援

<16-11,CASTLE>was to your own bank account?

422
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,640
<16-12,BECKETT>希斯顿是发现你诈骗他了吗
<16-12,BECKETT>Did Hixton get on to your scamming him?

423
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,820
<16-12,BECKETT>他是不是威胁要报警
<16-12,BECKETT>Did he threaten to go to the cops?

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,450
<16-12,BECKETT>-你是不是因此杀了他  -我说了
<16-12,BECKETT>- Is that why you killed him? - I told you,

425

<16-13,MEECH>我没杀他
<16-13,MEECH>I didn't kill him.

426
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,340
<16-13,MEECH>-我好几周没见他了  -真有趣

427
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,160
<16-14,BECKETT>因为我跟你房东谈过  他说
<16-14,BECKETT>because I talked to your landlord, and he said that

428
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,440

447
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,810
<17-2,BECKETT>为什么找米奇买枪
<17-2,BECKETT>And why go to Meech for a gun?

448
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,340
<17-2,BECKETT>为什么不报警  或是雇保镖
<17-2,BECKETT>Why not just go to the police or hire a bodyguard?

449
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,240
<17-3,RYAN>也许他认为他们保护不了他
<17-3,RYAN>Maybe he didn't think they could protect him.

450
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,380
<17-4,ESPOSITO>鉴证组检查了希斯顿的公寓
<17-4,ESPOSITO>CSU finished processing Hixton's apartment,

<17-5,BECKETT>现在因盗窃案服刑5年
<17-5,BECKETT>and currently serving a nickel for grand larceny.

458
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,450
<17-6,RYAN>那个消息有点滞后
<17-6,RYAN>Yeah, well, that info's a little bit behind.

459
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,650
<17-6,RYAN>他们因为监狱过于拥挤上周得以释放
<17-6,RYAN>They were released last week due to overcrowding.

460
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,220
<17-7,ESPOSITO>说说他们抢的是谁
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, get to the part about who they robbed.

461
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,120
<17-8,ESPOSITO>-希斯顿  -在他中奖一个月后
<17-8,ESPOSITO>- Hixton. - A month after he collected his jackpot.

462
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,350
<17-9,RYAN>尽管他们带着滑雪面具
<17-9,RYAN>Even though they wore ski masks,

463
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,920
<17-9,RYAN>他还是认出了他们的声音
<17-9,RYAN>he recognized them by their voices

464
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,590
<17-9,RYAN>因为他们从小一起长大
<17-9,RYAN>because they grew up together.

465
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,050
<17-9,RYAN>是他的证词使得他们锒铛入狱
<17-9,RYAN>It was his testimony that put them away.

466
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,480
<17-10,CASTLE>希斯顿一定是听说他们被释放了
<17-10,CASTLE>Hixton must have heard they were being released

467
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,960
<17-10,CASTLE>担心他们会来找他报复
<17-10,CASTLE>and worried they were coming after him again.

468
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,080
<17-11,RYAN>根据弗罗里达警方的说法
<17-11,RYAN>According to Florida police,

469
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,880
<17-11,RYAN>兄弟二人在家待了两天
<17-11,RYAN>the brothers were in town for all of two days

470

<17-11,RYAN>就收拾行李  开车北上
<17-11,RYAN>before the packed up their car and headed up north.

<17-11,RYAN>告诉邻居他们要去捕猎
<17-11,RYAN>Told a neighbor that they were going hunting.

472
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,520
<17-12,CASTLE>看来他们捕到了一个彩票中奖者
<17-12,CASTLE>Looks like they bagged themselves a lottery winner.

473
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,000
<18-1,CASTLE>天啊
<18-1,CASTLE>Whoa!

<18-1,CASTLE>in your surprise inheritance.

476
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,000
<18-1,CASTLE>是不是可以说全纽约的动物花纹
<18-1,CASTLE>Is it safe to say there is not an animal print left

477
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,910
<18-1,CASTLE>-都被买光了呢  -真好笑
<18-1,CASTLE>- in any store in New York City? - Very funny.

478
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,990
<18-2,MARTHA>估计是这样
<18-2,MARTHA>Probably true.

<18-3,CASTLE>恭喜你
<18-3,CASTLE>Well, congratulations.

480
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,150
<18-3,CASTLE>看起来你成功地完成了中头彩
<18-3,CASTLE>Looks like you have successfully completed the first stage

<18-4,MARTHA>下一步是什么
<18-4,MARTHA>What's the next stage?

483
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,120
<18-5,CASTLE>如果你是我那位中彩票的被害人
<18-5,CASTLE>Well, if you were my lottery-winning victim,

484
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,490
<18-5,CASTLE>你会转做慈善
<18-5,CASTLE>you'd turn to charity,

485
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,440
<18-5,CASTLE>然后在你的起居室被射杀
<18-5,CASTLE>and then get shot to death in your living room.

486
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,400
<18-6,MARTHA>算了
<18-6,MARTHA>I'll pass.

487
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,500
<18-6,MARTHA>再说  我打算把钱还回去
<18-6,MARTHA>Besides, I've decided to give back the money.

488
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,270
<18-7,CASTLE>什么  为什么
<18-7,CASTLE>What? Why?

489
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,620
<18-8,MARTHA>理查德  我本来要和他分手的
<18-8,MARTHA>Richard, I was about to break up with the man.

490
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,400
<18-8,MARTHA>你认为如果他知道的话
<18-8,MARTHA>Do you really think he would've left me that money

491
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,430
<18-8,MARTHA>还会给我留遗产吗
<18-8,MARTHA>if he'd know that?

492
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,190
<18-8,MARTHA>不不  我要把东西还回去
<18-8,MARTHA>No, no. I'm gonna return all this stuff.

493
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,190
<18-8,MARTHA>把钱也还回去  这样做才是对的
<18-8,MARTHA>I'm gonna give back the money. It's the right thing to do.

494
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,410
<18-9,CASTLE>你一下跳到第五步了
<18-9,CASTLE>Well, you've just jumped to stage five.

495
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,480
<18-9,CASTLE>释怀

<18-11,MARTHA>不是真的皮草
<18-11,MARTHA>It's not real.

499

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,170
<21-1,BECKETT>你之前说钱不会改变我们
<21-1,BECKETT>You said earlier that money doesn't change us,

520
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,190
<21-1,BECKETT>只会放大我们的个性
<21-1,BECKETT>it just magnifies who we are.

521
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,000
<21-1,BECKETT>你赚了大钱  你的什么个性被放大了
<21-1,BECKETT>W-what did your windfall magnify in you?

522
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,530
<21-2,CASTLE>一开始...是我那未泯的童心
<21-2,CASTLE>My inner child... At first.

523
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,940
<21-2,CASTLE>有点像希斯顿
<21-2,CASTLE>Kind of like Hixton.

524
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,910
<21-2,CASTLE>变成那种喜欢

<21-2,CASTLE>But then I realized,

527
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,050
<21-2,CASTLE>我真正在乎的奢侈品其实是自由
<21-2,CASTLE>the only luxury I truly care about is freedom.

<21-2,CASTLE>to spend time with Alexis.

530
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,740
<21-2,CASTLE>有了那些钱
<21-2,CASTLE>Having that money just...

531
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,450
<21-2,CASTLE>使得我可以过我想要的生活
<21-2,CASTLE>allows me to live life on my terms.

532
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,760
<21-4,CASTLE>-你长大了  -我可不会那样说
<21-4,CASTLE>- You grew up. - Well, I wouldn't go that far.

<23-14,BECKETT>从保险箱拿走的剩下的四万在哪
<23-14,BECKETT>you took from Hixton's safe when you killed him?

558
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,660
<23-14,BECKETT>是不是都花在你的饶舌事业上了
<23-14,BECKETT>You spend it on your rap career?

559

<23-15,GREG PAGE>我们没有杀他
<23-15,GREG PAGE>We didn't kill the man.

561
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,750
<23-15,GREG PAGE>我们是来这里帮他的
<23-15,GREG PAGE>We came up here to help him.

562
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,060
<23-16,TY PAGE>我们脱离帮派  现在是良民
<23-16,TY PAGE>Got out the joint for good behavior.

563
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,290
<23-16,TY PAGE>兄弟打给我们  说他需要救星
<23-16,TY PAGE>Dude called us up, said he needed a savior.

564
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,670
<23-17,CASTLE>别再饶舌了  我会买你们唱片的
<23-17,CASTLE>Stop rapping. I'll buy the album.

565
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,410
<23-17,CASTLE>救星
<23-17,CASTLE>Savior?

566
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,480
<23-18,GREG PAGE>没错  他女儿又开始吸毒了
<23-18,GREG PAGE>Yeah. His daughter got back into the drugs.

567
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,760
<23-18,GREG PAGE>他要采取些措施  所以找我们了
<23-18,GREG PAGE>He needed to make things right, so he called us.

568
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,930
<23-19,BECKETT>你们俩在佛罗里达州持枪抢劫希斯顿
<23-19,BECKETT>The two of you robbed Hixton at gunpoint in Florida.

569
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,110
<23-19,BECKETT>-他怎么会找你们  -希斯顿意识到
<23-19,BECKETT>- Why would he call you? - When Hixton realized

570
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,680
<23-20,GREG PAGE>尼可卷入了什么样的麻烦
<23-20,GREG PAGE>what kind of trouble Nicole was in,

571
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,720
<23-20,GREG PAGE>他知道我们是唯一能指望的人
<23-20,GREG PAGE>He knew we were the only people he could turn to.

572
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,910
<23-21,BECKETT>那你们到底能做什么去帮他的女儿
<23-21,BECKETT>And what could you possibly do to help his daughter

573
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,020
<23-21,BECKETT>戒掉毒瘾
<23-21,BECKETT>with her addiction?

574
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,670
<23-22,GREG PAGE>问题不是毒品  而是她的毒品供应商
<23-22,GREG PAGE>Problem wasn't the drugs. It was her dealer.

575
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,000
<23-22,GREG PAGE>一个叫奥兹的家伙
<23-22,GREG PAGE>A cat named Oz.

576
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,360
<23-22,GREG PAGE>尼可被他操控迷惑了
<23-22,GREG PAGE>Nicole was under his spell somethin' fierce.

577
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,010
<23-22,GREG PAGE>当希斯顿知道后  他去找了奥兹
<23-22,GREG PAGE>And when Hixton found out about it, he went to go see Oz,

578
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,070
<23-22,GREG PAGE>告诉他"离我女儿远一点"
<23-22,GREG PAGE>told the man, "Stay away from my daughter."

579
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,780
<23-22,GREG PAGE>但奥兹不肯  他就找了我们
<23-22,GREG PAGE>When Oz didn't, he called us.

580
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,850
<23-22,GREG PAGE>你不相信我的话  看我的钱包里面
<23-22,GREG PAGE>You don't believe me, look in my wallet.

581
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,190
<23-23,RYAN>看来尼可撒谎了
<23-23,RYAN>Looks like Nicole lied to me

582
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,870
<23-23,RYAN>她说她不认得他
<23-23,RYAN>when she told me she didn't recognize him.

583
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,130
<23-24,BECKETT>这就是希斯顿在监视的那个人
<23-24,BECKETT>It's the guy Hixton had under surveillance.

584
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,580
<23-24,BECKETT>这是奥兹吗
<23-24,BECKETT>Is this Oz?

585
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,750
<23-25,GREG PAGE>是的  当希斯顿打给我们
<23-25,GREG PAGE>Yep. When Hixton called us,

586
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,440
<23-25,GREG PAGE>我们立马开车过来
<23-25,GREG PAGE>we drove right up here.

587
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,900
<23-25,GREG PAGE>我们把奥兹从市中心的俱乐部里拽了出来
<23-25,GREG PAGE>Jumped Oz outside this club downtown.

588
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,290
<23-26,GREG PAGE>泰用管子修理了他的保镖
<23-26,GREG PAGE>Yo, Ty hit his bodyguard with a pipe.

589
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,070
<23-26,GREG PAGE>我将奥兹塞进后车箱  开到桥下
<23-26,GREG PAGE>I stuffed Oz in the trunk, drove under the bridge,

590
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,230
<23-26,GREG PAGE>揍了他一顿
<23-26,GREG PAGE>and beat on his ass.

591
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,320
<23-26,GREG PAGE>然后我们回到这里
<23-26,GREG PAGE>Then we came straight here,

592
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,130
<23-26,GREG PAGE>一直唱到现在
<23-26,GREG PAGE>been bouncin' tunes ever since.

593
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,840
<23-27,BECKETT>真的吗  他们昨晚过来了吗
<23-27,BECKETT>Is that true? Did they come here last night?

594
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,180
<23-28,GREG PAGE>没错  我们跟那家伙说
<23-28,GREG PAGE>Yeah, we told the man,

595
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,010
<23-28,GREG PAGE>"最好离尼可远点
<23-28,GREG PAGE>"Best stay away from Nicole

596
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,500
<23-28,GREG PAGE>否则我们就把你丢进河里"
<23-28,GREG PAGE>Or we gon' put your ass in the river."

597
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,150
<23-28,GREG PAGE>他说我们应该这样做  否则的话
<23-28,GREG PAGE>He told us we should do it, cause if we let him live,

598
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,930
<23-28,GREG PAGE>他会把我们活活烧死
<23-28,GREG PAGE>he was gonna burn us alive.

599
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,590
<23-28,GREG PAGE>你想知道谁杀了希斯顿  肯定是奥兹了
<23-28,GREG PAGE>You wanna know who killed Hixton? Gotta be Oz.

600
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,620
<23-29,CASTLE>那么希斯顿弄了把枪用来防范奥兹
<23-29,CASTLE>So Hixton gets a gun to protect himself from Oz.

601
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,860
<23-29,CASTLE>他不能找警察庇护
<23-29,CASTLE>He can't go to the cops

602
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,950
<23-29,CASTLE>因为那会令他女儿有麻烦
<23-29,CASTLE>'cause that'll get his daughter in trouble.

603
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,610
<23-30,TY PAGE>-发生什么事了   -莱恩  看住他们
<23-30,TY PAGE>- What the hell was that? - Ryan, watch them.

604
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,540
<23-32,RYAN>呆着别动
<23-32,RYAN>Stay right where you are.

605
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,710
<24-1,CASTLE>看来奥兹说要活活烧死他们
<24-1,CASTLE>Well, looks like Oz wasn't kidding

606
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,320
<24-1,CASTLE>并不是在开玩笑
<24-1,CASTLE>when he said he'd burn 'em alive.

607
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,610
<25-1,BECKETT>真的吗  尼可  你又开始吸毒了
<25-1,BECKETT>Is it true, Nicole? Did you start using again?

608
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,950
<25-2,NICOLE HIXTON>我戒毒后  奥兹来找我
<25-2,NICOLE HIXTON>After I got clean, Oz found me.

609
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,010
<25-2,NICOLE HIXTON>他说他希望我回去
<25-2,NICOLE HIXTON>He said he wanted me back.

610
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,710
<25-4,NICOLE HIXTON>- 尼可  -抱歉  妈妈
<25-4,NICOLE HIXTON>- Nicole. -I'm sorry, mom.

611
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,690
<25-4,NICOLE HIXTON>我很抱歉
<25-4,NICOLE HIXTON>I'm so sorry.

612
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,460
<25-5,NOREEN HIXTON>-你爸知道吗  -他责怪自己
<25-5,NOREEN HIXTON>- And your father knew? - He blamed himself.

613
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,740
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>他说他会搞定的
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>He said that he was gonna fix it all,

614
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,170
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>但我没想过
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>but I never thought...

615
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,890
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>这叫奥兹的家伙
<25-6,NICOLE HIXTON>This Oz--

616
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,730
<25-7,CASTLE>你认为他有能力杀害你父亲吗
<25-7,CASTLE>you think he's capable of killing your dad?

617
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:14,470
<25-8,NICOLE HIXTON>全都是我的错  爸爸是因我而死的
<25-8,NICOLE HIXTON>This is all my fault. Dad is dead because of me.

618
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,560
<25-9,NOREEN HIXTON>没事的
<25-9,NOREEN HIXTON>It's okay.

620
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,100
<26-2,CASTLE>难怪他要改名
<26-2,CASTLE>No wonder he changed his name.

621
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,770
<26-3,ESPOSITO>罪案科的资料显示  他有一个赚钱的小窍门
<26-3,ESPOSITO>According to vice, he has a lucrative gig

623
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,210
<26-3,ESPOSITO>就是贩卖高端毒品给城里的富人及明星
<26-3,ESPOSITO>peddling high-end product to the city's rich and famous,

624
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,280
<26-3,ESPOSITO>而汽车炸弹绝对是他的作案手法
<26-3,ESPOSITO>and a car bomb is definitely his M.O.

625
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
<26-3,ESPOSITO>去年他以同样手法炸死了个竞争者
<26-3,ESPOSITO>A competing dealer got blown up last year,

626
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,470
<26-3,ESPOSITO>但鉴于缺乏证据无法定罪
<26-3,ESPOSITO>but they didn't have enough evidence to convict.

627
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,210
<26-4,CASTLE>那么奥兹因为被打  射杀了希斯顿
<26-4,CASTLE>So Oz shoots Hixton for ordering the beatdown,

628
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,430
<26-4,CASTLE>然后企图炸死佩奇兄弟
<26-4,CASTLE>and then attempts to barbecue the Page brothers

629
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,730
<26-4,CASTLE>进行报复
<26-4,CASTLE>to complete his revenge.

630
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,930
<26-5,BECKETT>好的  去逮捕奥兹吧
<26-5,BECKETT>All right. Let's go pick up Oz.

631
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,640
<26-6,ESPOSITO>那个有点难度
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, that's gonna be difficult.

632
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,360
<26-6,ESPOSITO>罪案科的资料显示  奥兹几乎在地下活动
<26-6,ESPOSITO>According to vice, Oz pretty much operates off grid.

633
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,980
<26-6,ESPOSITO>只有在夜总会进行交易时
<26-6,ESPOSITO>The only time he's on is when he's dealing

634
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,410
<26-6,ESPOSITO>才会出现  而且他在那里
<26-6,ESPOSITO>out of word-of-mouth nightclubs, and even there, he's got

635
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,010
<26-6,ESPOSITO>有一大群保镖  侍应跟老主顾也会把风
<26-6,ESPOSITO>a network of bouncers, waiters, and patrons as lookouts.

636
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,760
<26-6,ESPOSITO>奥兹一有风吹草动
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Oz catches one whiff of bacon,

637
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,100
<26-6,ESPOSITO>就消失得无影无踪
<26-6,ESPOSITO>and he vanishes into thin air.

638
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,940
<26-7,CASTLE>肯定有办法能偷偷溜进去的
<26-7,CASTLE>There's gotta be some way to slip under the radar.

639
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,480
<26-8,CASTLE>干嘛
<26-8,CASTLE>What?

640
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,680
<26-9,BECKETT>我想我们要用到你的法拉利了
<26-9,BECKETT>I think we're gonna need your Ferrari.

641
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,170
<27-1,CASTLE>老妈
<27-1,CASTLE>Mother.

642

<27-2,MARTHA>噢  看看你  你看起来太美了
<27-2,MARTHA>Oh, my. Look at you. Oh, you look gorgeous.

643

<27-3,CASTLE>我只是来拿钥匙顺便换身衣服
<27-3,CASTLE>I'm just gonna grab my keys and change.

644
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,560
<27-4,MARTHA>你俩终于要去约会了吗
<27-4,MARTHA>You two going out on a date?

<27-5,BECKETT>We're just doing a little undercover work.

647

<27-5,BECKETT>你最近怎么样
<27-5,BECKETT>So how are you doing?

<27-6,MARTHA>I've been better.

649
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,340
<27-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔告诉我你决定要把钱还给他们
<27-7,BECKETT>Castle told me that you decided to give the money back.

650
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,720
<27-8,MARTHA>没错  我试过了  但切特的孩子拒绝了
<27-8,MARTHA>Yeah, well, I tried. Chet's kids refused to take it.

651
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,290
<27-8,MARTHA>他们说  他们的父亲很爱我
<27-8,MARTHA>They said, their father loved me,

652
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,930
<27-8,MARTHA>他希望我拿着这些钱
<27-8,MARTHA>He wanted me to have the money.

653
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,740
<27-8,MARTHA>所以我
<27-8,MARTHA>So I'm...

654
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,520
<27-8,MARTHA>在想到底该拿这些钱怎么办
<27-8,MARTHA>You know, trying to figure out what to do with it.

655
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,240
<27-8,MARTHA>我目前的想法似乎都很
<27-8,MARTHA>Everything I come up with seems so...

656
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,790
<27-8,MARTHA>自私和短浅
<27-8,MARTHA>Selfish and petty.

657
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,800
<27-9,BECKETT>噢  不要这样想
<27-9,BECKETT>Oh, well, it doesn't have to be that way.

658
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,000
<27-10,BECKETT>你知道么  有人告诉过我
<27-10,BECKETT>You know, someone once told me that

659
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,130
<27-10,BECKETT>金钱不会改变你
<27-10,BECKETT>money doesn't change you,

660
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,930
<27-10,BECKETT>只会放大你的个性
<27-10,BECKETT>it just magnifies who you are.

661
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,300
<27-10,BECKETT>你在乎过切特
<27-10,BECKETT>You cared about Chet.

662
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,520
<27-10,BECKETT>或许你能用这些钱来
<27-10,BECKETT>maybe you could do something

663
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,930
<27-10,BECKETT>做些对他表示敬意的事
<27-10,BECKETT>that would honor his memory somehow.

<4-7,BECKETT>You sure took a big step down in the wardrobe department.

708
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,430
<4-7,BECKETT>你将要退更大一步
<4-7,BECKETT>You're about to take and even bigger step down--

709
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,060
<30-1,BECKETT>穿上监狱囚衣

711
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,790
<30-1,BECKETT>时候当场将你逮捕

712
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,640
<30-1,BECKETT>要判二十年牢狱
<30-1,BECKETT>That's 20 years federal time.

713
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,030
<30-1,BECKETT>但那跟一级谋杀罪名的
<30-1,BECKETT>But that's nothing compared to

714
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,080
<30-1,BECKETT>服刑时间相比算不了什么
<30-1,BECKETT>the time that you're gonna do for first-degree murder.

715
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,300
<30-2,CASTLE>更别说引起爆炸的重罪了
<30-2,CASTLE>Not to mention felony blowing crap up.

716
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,740
<30-2,CASTLE>我不晓得你在说什么
<30-2,CASTLE>I don't know what you're talking about.

<30-3,BECKETT>你认得这家伙吗
<30-3,BECKETT>You remember this guy?

718
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,540
<30-3,BECKETT>你应该要认得  你杀了他
<30-3,BECKETT>You should. You killed him.

719
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,800
<30-3,BECKETT>还试着用汽车炸弹杀了这两个人
<30-3,BECKETT>And these two you tried to kill with a car bomb.

720
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,420
<30-3,BECKETT>我必须给那俩乡巴佬点颜色瞧瞧
<30-3,BECKETT>Look... I had to get those country boys back.

721
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,630
<30-4,CASTLE>但我没对希斯顿做任何事  我发誓
<30-4,CASTLE>But I didn't have anything to do with Hixton. I swear.

722
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,340
<30-4,CASTLE>目前情况是这样的  马文
<30-4,CASTLE>Here's a thing, Marvin--

723
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,480
<30-4,CASTLE>我们给希斯顿住址附近的人看你的照片
<30-4,CASTLE>We showed your picture around Hixton's place.

724
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,870
<30-4,CASTLE>说也奇怪  有人看到你在
<30-4,CASTLE>Oddly enough, people saw you there

725
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,090
<30-4,CASTLE>案发时间出现在那里
<30-4,CASTLE>right about the time he was killed.

726
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,100
<30-5,BECKETT>佩奇兄弟狠狠揍了你一顿
<30-5,BECKETT>Page brothers gave you a serious beating,

727
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,630
<30-5,BECKETT>你发誓要报仇  然后希斯顿就死了
<30-5,BECKETT>you vowed revenge, and then Hixton shows up dead

728
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,500
<30-5,BECKETT>而且有目击者在犯案现场看到你
<30-5,BECKETT>with witnesses claiming to see you at the crime scene?

729
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,000
<30-5,BECKETT>这对你并不乐观  马文
<30-5,BECKETT>That doesn't look good for you, Marvin,

730
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,030
<30-5,BECKETT>对我们撒谎只会令情况更糟
<30-5,BECKETT>and lying to us will only make it worse.

731
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,980
<30-5,BECKETT>好吧
<30-5,BECKETT>Okay.

732
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,560
<30-5,BECKETT>或许  我对自己的身体状况不满
<30-5,BECKETT>Maybe... I had hard feelings about my medical condition,

733
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,190
<30-6,BECKETT>或许我打算去找希斯顿谈谈
<30-6,BECKETT>and maybe I paid Hixton a visit to discuss them.

734
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,880
<30-6,BECKETT>但我还没进门就放弃找他了
<30-6,BECKETT>But I abandoned ship before I got to his door.

735
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,970
<30-6,BECKETT>你急着要当面跟希斯顿说清楚
<30-6,BECKETT>You were hot to straighten Hixton out,

736
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,840
<30-6,BECKETT>然后又改变了主意吗
<30-6,BECKETT>And you changed your mind?

737
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,850
<30-6,BECKETT>你真的认为我会相信你吗
<30-6,BECKETT>Do you really expect us to believe that?

738
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,150
<30-3,BECKETT>这是事实
<30-3,BECKETT>It's the truth.

739
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,540
<30-4,CASTLE>我坐电梯到上希斯顿的住处
<30-4,CASTLE>I took the elevator up to Hixton's place,

740
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,620
<30-5,BECKETT>电梯门打开后
<30-5,BECKETT>When the doors opened,

741
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,280
<30-6,BECKETT>有个家伙站在那儿
<30-6,BECKETT>there was a guy standing right there.

742
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,740
<30-7,CASTLE>他看见我了
<30-7,CASTLE>He got a good look at me.

743
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,380
<30-7,CASTLE>要是我还去找他的话
<30-7,CASTLE>If I would've gone though with my visit,

744
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,190
<30-7,CASTLE>那人肯定很容易就能指证我
<30-7,CASTLE>he woulda pointed me out in a lineup, easy.

745
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,550
<30-7,CASTLE>所以我走了
<30-7,CASTLE>So I walked away.

746
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,080
<30-7,CASTLE>你看清楚这家伙了吗
<30-7,CASTLE>You get a good look at this guy?

747
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,990
<34-18,ESPOSITO>是的  我们一起坐电梯到一层
<34-18,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Rode back down to the first floor with him.

748
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,300
<34-19,CASTLE>他大概五十岁
<34-19,CASTLE>He was maybe 50,

749
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,060
<34-20,ESPOSITO>绅士打扮  穿着一件经典燕尾服
<34-20,ESPOSITO>proper looking, wearing an old-school tuxedo.

750
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,950
<30-8,CASTLE>真的是管家干的
<30-8,CASTLE>The butler really did do it.

751
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,750
<31-1,CASTLE>管家伊斯利
<31-1,CASTLE>Easley the butler--

752
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,310
<31-1,CASTLE>忠诚  尽责
<31-1,CASTLE>Loyal, devoted,

753
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,610
<31-1,CASTLE>表面上因为主人的死极度伤心
<31-1,CASTLE>seemingly distraught over the death of his master.

754
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,910
<31-1,CASTLE>但始终隐藏在这顺从卑屈
<31-1,CASTLE>Yet all the while, lurking behind that mask

755
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,490
<31-1,CASTLE>的面具后面的  是一个杀手
<31-1,CASTLE>of servile correctness... was a killer.

756
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,250
<31-2,BECKETT>或者奥兹只是想扰乱我们的视线
<31-2,BECKETT>Or Oz is just trying to kick up some dust.

757
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,720
<31-2,BECKETT>我是说  管家的动机是什么
<31-2,BECKETT>I mean, what's the butler's motive?

758
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,300
<31-3,CASTLE>在小说里  通常都是两个原因
<31-3,CASTLE>Well, in fiction, it would be one of two things.

759
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,310
<31-3,CASTLE>第一个  他跟主人的妻子
<31-3,CASTLE>Firstly, he was carrying on a torrid affair

760
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,340
<31-3,CASTLE>-在暗度陈仓  -恶
<31-3,CASTLE>- with his master's wife. - Ew.

761
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,700
<31-4,CASTLE>另一个  就是跟钱有关
<31-4,CASTLE>Second, had to be the money.

762
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,470
<31-5,RYAN>我想卡塞尔或许猜对了
<31-5,RYAN>I think Castle might be on to something.

763
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,830
<31-5,RYAN>我深入调查了雷金纳德·伊斯利
<31-5,RYAN>I dug a little deeper into Reginald Easley,

764
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,410
<31-5,RYAN>他过去几任雇主都说
<31-5,RYAN>and his last few employers all say the same thing--

765
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,270
<31-5,RYAN>伊斯利都在某些昂贵物品失踪后辞职
<31-5,RYAN>Easley resigned after some of their valuables went missing.

766
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,470
<32-1,CASTLE>我意识到  我一直都想错方向了
<32-1,CASTLE>I realized, I've been thinking about this all wrong.

767
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,830
<32-1,CASTLE>你不是一个轻佻的人
<32-1,CASTLE>You're not a frivolous person,

768
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,010
<32-1,CASTLE>所以你不会用中彩票的钱
<32-1,CASTLE>so you wouldn't do frivolous things

769
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,630
<32-1,CASTLE>-做轻佻的事  -卡塞尔
<32-1,CASTLE>- with your lottery winnings. - Castle.

770
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,690
<32-3,CASTLE>不  我会查个水落石出的  如果你
<32-3,CASTLE>No, no. I'm gonna figure this out. If you...

771
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,030
<32-4,CASTLE>在收拾包袱吗
<32-4,CASTLE>Packing your things?

772
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,320
<32-5,EASLEY>这些不是我的
<32-5,EASLEY>These aren't my things.

773
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,220
<32-5,EASLEY>全都属于我的雇主
<32-5,EASLEY>They belong to my employer.

774
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,920
<32-6,CASTLE>肯定很辛苦  被这样一堆财产围绕着
<32-6,CASTLE>Must be hard, being around all this wealth,

775
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,110
<32-6,CASTLE>但全都不是你的
<32-6,CASTLE>none of it yours.

776
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,410
<32-7,EASLEY>-我对自己的待遇很满意  -真的吗
<32-7,EASLEY>- I'm content with my lot. - Really?

777
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,330
<32-8,BECKETT>我们查了你的背景
<32-8,BECKETT>We read up on you.

778
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,020
<32-8,BECKETT>在利兹的一个单亲家庭出身
<32-8,BECKETT>Born in Leeds to a single mother

779
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,500
<32-8,BECKETT>母亲是一个裁缝
<32-8,BECKETT>who was a seamstress.

780
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,180
<32-8,BECKETT>经过训练后  你改掉了你的口音
<32-8,BECKETT>With the right training, you lost the lowbrow accent

781
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,840
<32-8,BECKETT>学习如何跻身名流社会
<32-8,BECKETT>and learned to fit in with the gentry,

782
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,350
<32-8,BECKETT>你见到这些人一天就能花光
<32-8,BECKETT>where you saw people spend more in one day

783
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,490
<32-8,BECKETT>你母亲工作一年的钱
<32-8,BECKETT>than your mother made in an entire year.

784
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,170
<32-9,CASTLE>然后你遇到了希斯顿
<32-9,CASTLE>Then along comes Hixton,

785
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,400
<32-9,CASTLE>一个身世背景跟你相似的人
<32-9,CASTLE>a man with an upbringing not unlike your own.

786
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,390
<32-9,CASTLE>但这些都是属于他的  你也是他的
<32-9,CASTLE>But he owned all this, and he owned you,

787
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,570
<32-9,CASTLE>并不是因为任何特长或才智
<32-9,CASTLE>and not because of any special talent or intelligence.

788
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,650
<32-9,CASTLE>只是因为他猜到了六个数字
<32-9,CASTLE>Just because he guessed six numbers,

789
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,150
<32-9,CASTLE>而你没有
<32-9,CASTLE>and you didn't.

790
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,170
<32-9,CASTLE>从希斯顿那儿拿到的并不算是偷
<32-9,CASTLE>And taking from Hixton wasn't really stealing.

791
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,220
<32-9,CASTLE>只是为了更正命运的不公
<32-9,CASTLE>It was just correcting a karmic injustice.

792
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,930
<32-10,BECKETT>你逼他打开保险箱
<32-10,BECKETT>You made him open that safe,

793
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,810
<32-10,BECKETT>但你不知道他有枪
<32-10,BECKETT>but what you didn't know was that he had a gun,

794
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,360
<32-10,BECKETT>但他伸手去拿枪时  事情最终发展成这样
<32-10,BECKETT>and when he reached for it, this is where it ended.

795
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,670
<32-11,EASLEY>你怎么会这样想
<32-11,EASLEY>What on earth makes you think that?

796
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,970
<32-12,BECKETT>我们知道他被杀害当晚
<32-12,BECKETT>We know that you were here

797
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,350
<32-12,BECKETT>你在这里  伊斯利先生
<32-12,BECKETT>the night that he was killed, Mr. Easley,

798
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,540
<32-12,BECKETT>比你说你离开的时间更晚
<32-12,BECKETT>long after you said that you had left.

799
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,190
<32-13,EASLEY>不久前  他买了二十五本狄更斯的初版书
<32-13,EASLEY>Early on, he bought 25 first edition Dickens...

800
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,330
<32-13,EASLEY>查尔斯·狄更斯  他连看都没看过
<32-13,EASLEY>Charles Dickens-- and the man didn't even read.

801
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,510
<32-13,EASLEY>他只是喜欢书脊上
<32-13,EASLEY>He just liked the look of the leather

802
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,210
<32-14,BECKETT>-的皮革  -伊斯利先生
<32-14,BECKETT>- on their spines. - Mr. Easley--

803
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,790
<32-15,EASLEY>我偷了其中的两本
<32-15,EASLEY>I stole two of them.

804
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,010
<32-15,EASLEY>对我来说  就权当他作为
<32-15,EASLEY>To me, it was like levying a tax

805
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,500
<32-15,EASLEY>一个白痴给国家上税了
<32-15,EASLEY>on him for being an idiot.

806
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,210
<32-16,BECKETT>但后来我改变了主意
<32-16,BECKETT>But then I had a change of heart.

807
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,060
<32-15,EASLEY>我晚上把它们带回来了  十一点左右的时候
<32-15,EASLEY>I brought them back here that night, around 11:00,

808
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,500
<32-15,EASLEY>以为他和他妻子出去了
<32-15,EASLEY>thinking he was out with his wife.

809
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,840
<32-15,EASLEY>但因为某些原因他却在这儿
<32-15,EASLEY>But for some reason he was here.

810
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,660
<32-15,EASLEY>我听见淋浴的声音
<32-15,EASLEY>I...I heard the shower running.

811
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,530
<32-16,BECKETT>他被杀的那天夜里
<32-16,BECKETT>Your excuse for coming back here

812
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,530
<32-16,BECKETT>你返回这儿的理由
<32-16,BECKETT>the night that he was killed

813
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,970
<32-16,BECKETT>就是你改变了主意吗
<32-16,BECKETT>was that you had a change of heart?

814
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,800
<32-16,BECKETT>是的
<32-16,BECKETT>Yes.

815
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,810
<32-17,EASLEY>我倒愿意说是因为他转向慈善事业的行为
<32-17,EASLEY>I'd like to say it was because his turn to philanthropy

816
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,570
<32-17,EASLEY>让我对他刮目相看
<32-17,EASLEY>made me see him in a different light,

817
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,420
<32-17,EASLEY>作为一个好人他不应该被别人偷东西
<32-17,EASLEY>as a good man one shouldn't steal from.

818
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,490
<32-17,EASLEY>但实际上是因为  我吓坏了
<32-17,EASLEY>But the truth is, I was scared

819
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,450
<32-17,EASLEY>他的霉运可能会转到我身上
<32-17,EASLEY>his bad luck would become mine.

820
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,950
<32-18,CASTLE>他中了一亿美元的彩票
<32-18,CASTLE>He won over $100 million in the lottery.

821
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,110
<32-18,CASTLE>这算是哪门子的霉运啊
<32-18,CASTLE>One could hardly consider that bad luck.

822
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,500
<32-19,EASLEY>他婚姻失败  女儿染上了毒品
<32-19,EASLEY>Mm. His marriage failed, his daughter fell into drugs,

823
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,550
<32-19,EASLEY>而且他刚刚在自己公寓被枪杀
<32-19,EASLEY>and he was just gunned down in his own apartment.

824
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,900
<32-19,EASLEY>这就是天地万物的规律
<32-19,EASLEY>That, sir, is the universe...

825
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,030
<32-19,EASLEY>你刚才管这叫什么来着
<32-19,EASLEY>what did you call it?

826
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,370
<32-19,EASLEY>哦对了  "更正命运的不公"
<32-19,EASLEY>Oh, yes, "Correcting a karmic injustice."

827
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,620
<32-20,BECKETT>你这是什么意思
<32-20,BECKETT>What do you mean?

828
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,130
<32-20,BECKETT>中奖的那张彩票
<32-20,BECKETT>The winning lottery ticket.

829
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,510
<32-21,EASLEY>在喝了不少酒之后
<32-21,EASLEY>Hixton let it slip one night

830
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,730
<32-21,EASLEY>希斯顿有天晚上说漏了嘴
<32-21,EASLEY>after a little too much time with the bottle.

831
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,310
<32-21,EASLEY>他总是下注相同的数字
<32-21,EASLEY>He always played the same numbers...

832
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,390
<32-21,EASLEY>他和他妻子相遇和结婚的日子
<32-21,EASLEY>the dates he and his wife met and were married

833
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,510
<32-21,EASLEY>010395和102498
<32-21,EASLEY>010395 and 102498.

834
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,510
<32-22,CASTLE>彩票上并没有这些数字
<32-22,CASTLE>None of those numbers are on the ticket.

835
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,690
<32-23,EASLEY>所有的痛苦都来源于金钱吗
<32-23,EASLEY>All the misery that came from the money?

836
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,640
<32-23,EASLEY>希斯顿这么认为是因为他偷了彩票
<32-23,EASLEY>Hixton believed it was because he stole the ticket.

837
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,930
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>你们觉得希斯顿是因为
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>So you think hixton was murdered

838
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,290
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>偷了彩票而被谋杀吗
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>because he stole the ticket?

839
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,730
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>-不  -是
<33-1,MONTGOMERY>- No. - Yes.

840
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,110
<33-2,CASTLE>得了吧  你...我的意思是
<33-2,CASTLE>Come on. You...I mean,

841
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,440
<33-2,CASTLE>这彩票价值一大笔钱呢
<33-2,CASTLE>it was worth a fortune.

842
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,320
<33-3,BECKETT>伊斯利完全有理由编造一个那样的故事
<33-3,BECKETT>Easley had every reason to make up that story,

843
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,610
<33-3,BECKETT>即使那些不是希斯顿的常规数字
<33-3,BECKETT>and even if those weren't hixton's regular numbers,

844
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,290
<33-3,BECKETT>这也不能证明是他偷了彩票
<33-3,BECKETT>it still doesn't prove that he stole the ticket.

845
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,260
<33-4,CASTLE>但偷彩票解释通了很多希斯顿的行为
<33-4,CASTLE>But the theft explains so much about Hixton's behavior.

846
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,340
<33-4,CASTLE>救济所的主管
<33-4,CASTLE>The director of the soup kitchen

847
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,320
<33-4,CASTLE>说希斯顿强迫症一样地发钱
<33-4,CASTLE>said that Hixton compulsively gave away his money,

848
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,470
<33-4,CASTLE>就像他根本不值得拥有它们一样
<33-4,CASTLE>like he felt he didn't deserve it.

849
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,460
<33-4,CASTLE>我管这叫中奖者的愧疚
<33-4,CASTLE>I called it winner's guilt.

850
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,510
<33-4,CASTLE>但如果这完全是另外一种愧疚呢
<33-4,CASTLE>But what if it was another kind of guilt entirely?

851
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,110
<33-5,BECKETT>那好吧  我们就暂定你是对的
<33-5,BECKETT>Okay, fine. Let's say that you're right.

852
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,710
<33-5,BECKETT>我们假设是希斯顿偷了彩票
<33-5,BECKETT>Let's say that Hixton stole the ticket.

853
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,480
<33-5,BECKETT>但依然没有证据证明
<33-5,BECKETT>There's still no evidence suggesting the

854
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,800
<33-5,BECKETT>这导致了他的死
<33-5,BECKETT>that contributed to his death.

855
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,340
<33-6,CASTLE>你是第一个告诉我
<33-6,CASTLE>You're the first person to tell me

856
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,450
<33-6,CASTLE>在谋杀案调查中没有巧合可言的人
<33-6,CASTLE>that there are no coincidences in a murder investigation.

857
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,360
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>等下  警官
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>Hold on, detective.

858
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,780
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>他说中了  你说希斯顿告诉米奇
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>He's got a point. You said Hixton told Meech

859
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,290
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>他的过去又找上门来了
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>his past was coming back to get him.

860
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,100
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>我们以为是佩奇兄弟
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>Now we thought he meant the Page brothers.

861
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,310
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>但这张彩票揭示了
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>But this ticket represents

862
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,190
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>发生在他身上最大的一件事
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>the biggest thing that ever happened to him.

863
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,770
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>我管这叫谋杀的主要动机
<33-7,MONTGOMERY>I call that a major motive for murder.

864
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,060
<33-8,BECKETT>好吧  如果这是真的我们该怎样证明
<33-8,BECKETT>Okay, fine. Then if it's true, how do we prove it?

865
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,850
<33-9,CASTLE>通过数字啊
<33-9,CASTLE>The numbers.

866
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,440
<34-1,CASTLE>2  4  8
<34-1,CASTLE>2, 4, 8...

867
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,010
<34-1,CASTLE>19  41  和79
<34-1,CASTLE>19, 41, and 79.

868
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,480
<34-1,CASTLE>我知道这希望渺茫
<34-1,CASTLE>I know it's a long shot,

869
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,810
<34-1,CASTLE>但如果我们研究出这些数字的含义
<34-1,CASTLE>but if we can figure out what these numbers signify,

870
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,790
<34-1,CASTLE>我们有可能找到彩票真正的主人
<34-1,CASTLE>we might be able to find the ticket's real owner.

871
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,190
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>我用我孩子的生日下注
<34-2,MONTGOMERY>I play my kids' birthdays.

872
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,600
<34-3,ESPOSITO>我用第一次上床和格斗的日期下注
<34-3,ESPOSITO>I play my firsts-- sex and combat.

873
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,110
<34-4,RYAN>我跟他一样
<34-4,RYAN>I play his firsts, too.

874
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,180
<34-4,RYAN>咋了  这样的话我们俩都能赢
<34-4,RYAN>What? That way, we both win,

875
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,610
<34-4,RYAN>而且一点也不尴尬
<34-4,RYAN>and it's not awkward.

876
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,740
<34-6,BECKETT>-贝克特你呢  -对不起我不下注  卡塞尔
<34-6,BECKETT>- Beckett? - Uh, sorry. I don't play, Castle.

877
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,960
<34-7,CASTLE>-但如果你下注呢  -这无关紧要  卡塞尔
<34-7,CASTLE>- But if you did? - Well, it doesn't really matter, Castle.

878
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,740
<34-8,BECKETT>事实上是
<34-8,BECKETT>I mean, the fact is,

879
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,860
<34-8,BECKETT>希斯顿一年前中了彩票
<34-8,BECKETT>Hixton won the lottery a year ago.

880
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,880
<34-8,BECKETT>如果他是偷的那张彩票
<34-8,BECKETT>If he stole that ticket,

881
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,900
<34-8,BECKETT>真正的中奖者为什么不站出来呢
<34-8,BECKETT>why didn't the rightful owner come forward sooner?

882
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,970
<34-9,MONTGOMERY>也许真正的中奖者死了
<34-9,MONTGOMERY>Maybe the rightful owner is dead.

883
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,370
<34-10,CASTLE>也许是希斯顿杀了他
<34-10,CASTLE>Maybe Hixton killed him.

884
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,670
<34-10,CASTLE>月球上的地  希斯顿所做的奇怪的购买
<34-10,CASTLE>The moon. The weird purchases hixton made.

885
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,180
<34-10,CASTLE>他刚一赢钱  就买了月球上三英亩的地
<34-10,CASTLE>As soon as he won, he bought 3 acres on the moon

886
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,780
<34-10,CASTLE>还为他邻居买了一座陵墓
<34-10,CASTLE>and a mausoleum for his neighbor.

887
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,500
<34-11,BECKETT>-查出所有关于他邻居的事  -这就去
<34-11,BECKETT>- Find out everything we can on this neighbor.- I'm on it.

888
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,280
<34-12,ESPOSITO>如果你是对的  卡塞尔  我打赌希斯顿的邻居
<34-12,ESPOSITO>If you're right, Castle, I'm betting Hixton's neighbor

889
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,320
<34-13,BECKETT>没料到他这辈子最幸运的日子
<34-13,BECKETT>never imagined that the luckiest day of his life

890
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,950
<34-13,BECKETT>-也是他的祭日  -我赞成
<34-13,BECKETT>- would also be his last.- Boo-yah!

891
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,990
<34-14,ESPOSITO>邻居名字叫汉克·沃特斯
<34-14,ESPOSITO>Neighbor's name was Hank Walters.

892
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,240
<34-14,ESPOSITO>他死于公布彩票中奖结果那天
<34-14,ESPOSITO>He died the day the winning numbers were announced.

893
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,780
<34-15,CASTLE>沃特斯的生日是1941年8月2日
<34-15,CASTLE>Walters' birthday-- 2/8/41--

894
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,260
<34-15,CASTLE>彩票上的三个数字
<34-15,CASTLE>Three of the numbers in the lottery ticket.

895
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,180
<34-16,ESPOSITO>两天之后
<34-16,ESPOSITO>Two days later,

896
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,220
<34-16,ESPOSITO>希斯顿站出来索要他的1.17亿支票
<34-16,ESPOSITO>Hixton came forward to claim his $117 million check.

897
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,750
<34-17,BECKETT>沃特斯死于什么
<34-17,BECKETT>What did Walters die of?

898
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,360
<34-18,ESPOSITO>-自然死亡  -真的吗
<34-18,ESPOSITO>- Natural causes.- For real?

899
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,710
<34-19,CASTLE>没错  他是一个死于
<34-19,CASTLE>Yeah. He was an old man dying of,

900
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,880
<34-20,ESPOSITO>大约六种不同疾病的老人
<34-20,ESPOSITO>like, six different things.

901
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,930
<34-20,ESPOSITO>蕾妮已经尸检过
<34-20,ESPOSITO>Lanie went over the autopsy,

902
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,810
<34-20,ESPOSITO>她说所有东西看上去
<34-20,ESPOSITO>said everything looked like

903
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,850
<34-20,ESPOSITO>都毫无疑点
<34-20,ESPOSITO>it was on the up-and-up.

904
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,670
<34-21,CASTLE>也就是说沃特斯早已卧床不起
<34-21,CASTLE>So Walters is bedridden.

905
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,830
<34-21,CASTLE>希斯顿就像是所有好邻居一样  问老人
<34-21,CASTLE>Hixton, like any good neighbor, asks the old man

906
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,230
<34-21,CASTLE>有什么他能为他做的
<34-21,CASTLE>if there's anything he can do for him.

907
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,120
<34-21,CASTLE>沃特斯说  帮我买张彩票
<34-21,CASTLE>Walters says, "Yes, buy me a lottery ticket."

908
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>也许这只是一锤子买卖
<5-15,NOREEN HIXTON>Maybe it was a onetime thing.

909
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,220
<34-21,CASTLE>也许他一直这样做
<34-21,CASTLE>Maybe he did it all the time.

910
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:48,100
<34-21,CASTLE>这次  中奖数字公布后
<34-21,CASTLE>This time, the numbers are announced,

911
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,470
<34-21,CASTLE>沃特斯中奖了
<34-21,CASTLE>and Walters won.

912
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,460
<34-21,CASTLE>希斯顿冲回去告诉他  却发现沃特斯死了
<34-21,CASTLE>Hixton rushes back to tell him and finds Walters dead.

913
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,620
<34-22,BECKETT>他不知该怎么办
<34-22,BECKETT>And doesn't know what to do.

914
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,540
<34-22,BECKETT>这就是为什么他隔了两天才站出来
<34-22,BECKETT>That's why it took him an extra day to come forward.

915
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,300
<34-22,BECKETT>他在做思想道德上的斗争
<34-22,BECKETT>He was struggling with the moral implications.

916
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,660
<34-23,CASTLE>没错  但人有多大胆  地有多大产
<34-23,CASTLE>Yeah, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

917
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,900
<34-23,CASTLE>他声称彩票是他自己的
<34-23,CASTLE>He claimed the ticket as his own.

918
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,290
<34-23,CASTLE>很显然没别人知道此事
<34-23,CASTLE>Clearly no one else knew about it.

919
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,420
<34-24,BECKETT>那家人呢  沃特斯有家人吗
<34-24,BECKETT>What about family? Did walters have any?

920
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,340
<34-25,RYAN>根据记录  汉克·沃特斯唯一活着的亲属
<34-25,RYAN>According to county records, the only living relative

921
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,270
<34-25,RYAN>是一个叫汤姆的侄子
<34-25,RYAN>of Hank Walters is a nephew named Tom,

922
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,410
<34-26,BECKETT>-猜猜他住在哪  -纽约
<34-26,BECKETT>- and guess where he lives.- New york city.

923
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,090
<34-26,BECKETT>抱歉
<34-26,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

924
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,710
<35-1,TOM WALTERS>你是在说我继承了一亿美元吗
<35-1,TOM WALTERS>Are you telling me that I might inherit $100 million?

925
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,830
<35-2,CASTLE>得了吧  汤姆  你早都知道了
<35-2,CASTLE>Come on, tom. You already figured that out.

926
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,020
<35-2,CASTLE>你与希斯顿对峙
<35-2,CASTLE>You confronted Hixton.

927
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,600
<35-2,CASTLE>你告诉他你想要回财产
<35-2,CASTLE>You told him you wanted restitution.

928

964
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,970
<36-6,BECKETT>威胁他如果不按你说的做
<36-6,BECKETT>threatened him with all kinds of things

965
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,180

<36-10,SHAWN YORK>I went to his apartment to collect what was mine.

977
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,240
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>他告诉我...
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>He told me...

978

<36-10,SHAWN YORK>他说我是个人渣罪犯
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>He said that I was a dirtbag criminal,

980
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,000
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>如果他把钱给了我  我会做的
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>And all I was gonna do if he gave it to me

981
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,030
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>无非就是挥霍一空
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>was put it up my nose.

982
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:42,030
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>取而代之的是  他要把钱全捐出去
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>Instead, he was gonna give it all away...

983
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,060
<36-10,SHAWN YORK>给那些需要的人

985
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,300

<36-10,SHAWN YORK>Then he grabbed for my gun.

986
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,570
