<7-3,CASTLE>什么时候戴米安变成嫌犯了
<7-3,CASTLE>Since when is Damian a suspect?

<7-5,CASTLE>真正的嫌疑犯  比如工匠
<7-5,CASTLE>real suspects, like workmen,

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
<7-5,CASTLE>比如神秘的帮派成员
<7-5,CASTLE>Like, uh, mystery gang members?

127
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,330
<7-6,ESPOSITO>哎哟这不是卡塞尔么
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Yo! Castle.

128
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,880
<7-7,RYAN>你赶上了
<7-7,RYAN>Hey, you made it.

129
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,450
<7-8,CASTLE>我和戴米安·韦斯莱的朋友
<7-8,CASTLE>Yeah. So I talked with

130
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,810
<7-9,RYAN>查尔斯·厄特利谈过了
<7-9,RYAN>Damian Westlake's friend, Charles Utley.

131
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,130
<7-9,RYAN>他说当戴米安看到妻子的尸体时
<7-9,RYAN>He said Damian was distraught

132
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,930
<7-9,RYAN>几乎失控
<7-9,RYAN>when he found his wife's body,

133
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,040
<7-9,RYAN>但他提到当他们像平常一样进行友谊赛时
<7-9,RYAN>but he also says that during their normally friendly game,

134
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,670
<7-9,RYAN>戴米安表现出不寻常的紧张和侵略性
<7-9,RYAN>Damian was unusually tense and aggressive.

135
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,800
<7-10,ESPOSITO>所以有可能他先朝妻子射钉
<7-10,ESPOSITO>So maybe he shoots his wife,

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,860
<7-10,ESPOSITO>然后去打篮球
<7-10,ESPOSITO>then goes to shoot some hoops,

137
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,380
<7-10,ESPOSITO>弄伤他的朋友  带他进屋做不在场证明
<7-10,ESPOSITO>injures his friend, brings him inside to establish an alibi.

138
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,120
<7-11,CASTLE>薇琪·韦斯莱星期五和一个工匠
<7-11,CASTLE>You know, Vicky Westlake had an argument

139
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,440
<7-11,CASTLE>有过争执
<7-11,CASTLE>with one of her workers on Friday.

140
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,470
<7-11,CASTLE>这个工匠  就我目前所推测
<7-11,CASTLE>A worker who, and I'm just speculating here,

141
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,820
<7-11,CASTLE>是有经验使用钉枪的人
<7-11,CASTLE>may have some experience with nail guns.

142
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,700
<7-11,CASTLE>也许我们应该根据这条线索先查查清楚
<7-11,CASTLE>Maybe we should go run and check out that lead

143
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,990
<7-11,CASTLE>再对一个无辜的人做出草率的判断
<7-11,CASTLE>before we rush to judgment on an innocent man.

144
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,150
<7-12,BECKETT>打断下  这就是你说的不妨碍我工作吗
<7-12,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Is this you staying out of the way?

145
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,370
<7-13,CASTLE>我只是想说
<7-13,CASTLE>This is me simply making a point

146
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,650
<7-13,CASTLE>还有其他的目标嫌疑人
<7-13,CASTLE>about remaining objective.

<8-5,AMBER PATINELLI>天哪  你们不会以为莫里斯是凶手吧
<8-5,AMBER PATINELLI>Oh, my god. You don't think that Morris did this?

155

<8-6,RYAN>我们正在调查几个嫌疑人
<8-6,RYAN>We're looking at several suspects.

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,510
<8-7,ESPOSITO>莫里斯干了什么会被开除
<8-7,ESPOSITO>What did Morris do to get fired?

<8-8,AMBER PATINELLI>他偷了她的订婚戒指
<8-8,AMBER PATINELLI>He stole her engagement ring.

<8-8,AMBER PATINELLI>薇琪担心会被抢劫
<8-8,AMBER PATINELLI>Vicky was afraid of getting mugged,

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
<8-8,AMBER PATINELLI>所以她不常戴着  上周她在

<8-10,AMBER PATINELLI>她就要报警  莫里斯疯了
<8-10,AMBER PATINELLI>she'd have to call the police. Morris went crazy.

<8-12,AMBER PATINELLI>and he made a scene.

170
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,070

<11-4,CASTLE>But there were other prints on the weapon.

209
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,380
<11-5,BECKETT>只是部分  都不在系统记录里
<11-5,BECKETT>Partials, but none of them are in the system.

210
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,220
<11-6,CASTLE>好吧  有什么新线索
<11-6,CASTLE>Okay, so what's our new theory?

211
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,540
<11-6,CASTLE>谁是我们新的嫌疑人
<11-6,CASTLE>Who's our new suspect?

212
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,550
<11-6,CASTLE>算了吧  不会是戴米安的
<11-6,CASTLE>Oh, come on. Not Damian.

213
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,640
<11-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  当坏人
<11-7,BECKETT>Castle, bad guys

214
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,850
<11-7,BECKETT>带着武器闯进屋子时
<11-7,BECKETT>breaking into houses bring their own weapons,

215
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,510
<11-7,BECKETT>狗是会冲着陌生人叫的
<11-7,BECKETT>dogs bark at strangers,

216
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,800
<11-7,BECKETT>而且超过三分之一的
<11-7,BECKETT>and over one-third

217
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,920
<11-7,BECKETT>家庭女性凶杀案的受害者
<11-7,BECKETT>of domestic female homicide victims

218
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,160
<11-7,BECKETT>是被他们的丈夫所杀
<11-7,BECKETT>are murdered by their husbands.

219
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,940
<11-8,CASTLE>我不管什么数据
<11-8,CASTLE>I don't care about statistics.

220
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,670
<11-8,CASTLE>我告诉你  戴米安不会杀人
<11-8,CASTLE>I am telling you, Damian is not capable of murder.

221
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,560
<11-9,BECKETT>告诉你吧  我人生至今为止只遇到过三个人
<11-9,BECKETT>You know, I could say that about maybe three people

222
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,150
<11-9,BECKETT>让我敢担保他们不会杀人
<11-9,BECKETT>that I've met in my entire life.

223
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,510
<11-9,BECKETT>这个人有什么地方可以让你如此
<11-9,BECKETT>What is it about this guy that--that warrants

224
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,750
<11-9,BECKETT>坚定不移地担保他
<11-9,BECKETT>this unshakable faith that you have in him?

225
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,010
<11-10,CASTLE>我14岁时  妈妈送我去艾维克学院
<11-10,CASTLE>When I was 14, my Mom sent me to Edgewyck Academy.

226
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,380
<11-10,CASTLE>我想家  又没有朋友
<11-10,CASTLE>I... I was homesick, and I didn't have any friends,

227
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,080
<11-10,CASTLE>所以我就把一切都记录下来
<11-10,CASTLE>so I wrote about it.

228
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,060
<11-10,CASTLE>一天  我向文学杂志投稿
<11-10,CASTLE>One day, I submitted a story to the literary magazine.

229
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,760
<11-10,CASTLE>戴米安·韦斯莱是编辑
<11-10,CASTLE>Damian Westlake was the editor.

230
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,820
<11-11,BECKETT>他登了你的作品
<11-11,BECKETT>And he published it.

231
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,890
<11-11,BECKETT>不止是这样
<11-11,BECKETT>More than that.

232
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,070
<11-12,CASTLE>他把我叫到他的办公室
<11-12,CASTLE>He called me down to his office,

233
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,620
<11-12,CASTLE>他请我坐下  说"里奇"
<11-12,CASTLE>he sat me down, and he said, "Ricky..."

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,870
<11-12,CASTLE>"你很有天赋"
<11-12,CASTLE>"You have a great talent."

235
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,690
<11-12,CASTLE>以前从没人对我说过那样的话
<11-12,CASTLE>No one had ever said anything like that to me before.

236
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,690
<11-12,CASTLE>戴米安  他鼓励我  指导我  他
<11-12,CASTLE>Damian, he encouraged me, he critiqued me, he...

237
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,870
<11-12,CASTLE>他帮我挖掘出更深层的自我
<11-12,CASTLE>he always made me dig a little deeper.

238
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,890
<11-12,CASTLE>没有戴米安·韦斯莱  我可能会成为律师
<11-12,CASTLE>Without Damian Westlake, I'm a lawyer,

239
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,260
<11-12,CASTLE>骗子或者是放牧人竞技会上的小丑
<11-12,CASTLE>I'm a grifter, I'm a rodeo clown,

240
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,830
<11-12,CASTLE>总之我不会成为一个作家
<11-12,CASTLE>but I am not a writer.

241
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,160
<11-12,CASTLE>没有他  就没有现在的我
<11-12,CASTLE>Without him, I'm not me.

242
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,130
<11-13,ESPOSITO>我对戴米安·韦斯莱
<11-13,ESPOSITO>Yo. I ran a standard background check

243
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,370
<11-13,ESPOSITO>做了一个标准的背景调查
<11-13,ESPOSITO>on Damian Westlake.

244
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,660
<11-13,ESPOSITO>原来薇琪不是他第一个死于袭击的
<11-13,ESPOSITO>Turns out Vicky isn't the first family member

245
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,940
<11-13,ESPOSITO>-家人  -你是指他的父亲吗
<11-13,ESPOSITO>- that he's lost to violence. - You mean his father.

246
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,690
<11-14,CASTLE>戴米安19岁时  他父亲死在韦斯莱家
<11-14,CASTLE>When Damian was 19, his father was killed

247
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,950
<11-14,CASTLE>位于波多黎各的度假屋里
<11-14,CASTLE>at the Westlake vacation home in Puerto Rico.

248
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,480
<11-15,BECKETT>不是自然死亡  卡塞尔  而是谋杀
<11-15,BECKETT>Not killed, Castle. Murdered.

249
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,990
<11-16,ESPOSITO>你怎么没告诉我们这个
<11-16,ESPOSITO>And you didn't tell us?

250
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,720
<11-17,CASTLE>告诉你们什么
<11-17,CASTLE>Tell you what?

251
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,090
<11-17,CASTLE>二十年前戴米安的父亲是
<11-17,CASTLE>H-how is the tragic death of Damian's father

252
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,170
<11-17,CASTLE>怎么惨死的
<11-17,CASTLE>over two decades ago

253
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,660
<11-17,CASTLE>这和这件案子有什么关系吗
<11-17,CASTLE>in any way relevant to this case?

254
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,260
<11-18,BECKETT>我来告诉你有什么关系
<11-18,BECKETT>I'll tell you how.

255
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,180
<11-18,BECKETT>调查那件案子的警察
<11-18,BECKETT>The cops that were investigating that case

256
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,730
<11-18,BECKETT>将戴米安列为主要嫌疑犯
<11-18,BECKETT>named Damian as the prime suspect.

259
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,770
<11-18,BECKETT>翻译：摄氏零度   咖啡十三   小易   千花

261
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,650
<12-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  讲朋友义气是一回事
<12-1,BECKETT>Castle, it's one thing for you to look out for your friend.

262
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,220
<12-1,BECKETT>但对我隐瞒重要线索
<12-1,BECKETT>It's a completely different story

263
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,020
<12-1,BECKETT>就完全是另外一回事了
<12-1,BECKETT>when you hide vital information from me.

264
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,740
<12-2,CASTLE>我没有想隐瞒  我只是觉得它不重要
<12-2,CASTLE>I wasn't hiding it. I just didn't think it mattered.

265
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,250
<12-3,BECKETT>你觉得戴米安曾是某起凶杀案的
<12-3,BECKETT>You didn't think it mattered

266
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,300
<12-3,BECKETT>主要嫌疑人这件事不重要
<12-3,BECKETT>that Damian was a suspect in a previous homicide?

267
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,920
<12-4,CASTLE>我不知道他是嫌疑人
<12-4,CASTLE>I didn't know he was a suspect.

268
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,230
<12-4,CASTLE>既然他从未被逮捕
<12-4,CASTLE>And since he was never arrested,

269
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,580
<12-4,CASTLE>而且那件案子一直没破
<12-4,CASTLE>and that case is still unsolved,

270
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,700
<12-4,CASTLE>我认为那些警察有很多假设
<12-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing those cops have a lot of theories

271
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,090
<12-4,CASTLE>但却没有证据证明  就像某位现在
<12-4,CASTLE>and no evidence, like another detective I could name

272
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,830
<12-4,CASTLE>站在我眼前的警官这样
<12-4,CASTLE>right about now.

273
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,840
<12-5,BECKETT>如果这是别人
<12-5,BECKETT>You know, if this was anybody else,

274
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,100
<12-5,BECKETT>你一定会在问我
<12-5,BECKETT>you'd be asking me

275
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,310
<12-5,BECKETT>为什么我还没有把他们铐起来
<12-5,BECKETT>why I hadn't already slapped the cuffs on 'em.

276
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,690
<12-6,CASTLE>但这不是别人
<12-6,CASTLE>But it isn't anyone else.

277
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,710
<12-6,CASTLE>而且我告诉你
<12-6,CASTLE>And I'm telling you,

278
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,240
<12-6,CASTLE>在这件案子上你错得离谱了
<12-6,CASTLE>you are way off base on this one.

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,880
<12-8,ESPOSITO>-怎么了  -老爸老妈吵架了
<12-8,ESPOSITO>- What's going on? - Mom and dad are fighting.

280
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,110
<12-9,RYAN>谁占上风
<12-9,RYAN>Who's winning?

281
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,570
<12-10,BECKETT>我们协商好了你在这件案子上
<12-10,BECKETT>We agreed that you would stay out of my way

282
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,420
<12-11,CASTLE>不能干涉我  -没错  但我没同意
<12-11,CASTLE>on this. Yes, but I did not agree

283
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,420
<12-11,CASTLE>我会袖手旁观让你们诬陷我的朋友
<12-11,CASTLE>I would stand by and let you railroad my friend!

284
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,770
<12-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这单案子你太感情用事了
<12-12,BECKETT>Castle, you are too close to this one.

285
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,490
<12-12,BECKETT>你必需回家
<12-12,BECKETT>You need to go home!

286
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,420
<12-12,BECKETT>现在就回
<12-12,BECKETT>Now!

287
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,540
<12-13,RYAN>-没错  -谢谢你 比利
<12-13,RYAN>-Yeah...-Thanks, Billy.

288
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,340
<12-13,RYAN>非常感谢
<12-13,RYAN>Really appreciate that.

289
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,990
<12-15,RYAN>好  我会尽快  谢谢
<12-15,RYAN>Yeah, as soon as possible. Thank you.

290
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,340
<12-16,ESPOSITO>好的
<12-16,ESPOSITO>Okay.

291
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
<12-17,BECKETT>我们看一下菲利普·韦斯莱案子的卷宗吧
<12-17,BECKETT>Let's get ahold of Philip Westlake's case file.

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,370
<12-17,BECKETT>我想查出为什么当时逮捕他
<12-17,BECKETT>I want to find out why no arrests were made.

293
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,890
<12-17,BECKETT>还有薇琪·韦斯莱的前夫西蒙·坎贝尔
<12-17,BECKETT>And Vicky Westlake's ex-husband, Simon Campbell,

294
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,590
<12-17,BECKETT>把他带到局里吧
<12-17,BECKETT>let's bring him in.

<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Sorry. I... I had to get outta there.

296
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,150
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我总感觉自己会听见薇琪说话
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I keep thinking I'm gonna hear Vicky's voice

297
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,320
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>或者我走到拐角时
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>or I'm gonna come around the corner

298
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,260
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>看到她蜷缩着躺在沙发上
<13-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>and see her curled up on the sofa.

299

<13-2,CASTLE>听着 戴米安  我很抱歉
<13-2,CASTLE>Listen, Damian, I'm sorry.

300
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,240
<13-2,CASTLE>调查中出了一点事
<13-2,CASTLE>Something's come up in the investigation.

301

<13-2,CASTLE>你爸爸的谋杀案里  你是嫌疑人
<13-2,CASTLE>Your father's murder...you were a suspect.

302
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,660
<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>一些疯子闯进了我家
<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Some creep broke into our house,

<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>洗劫一空  打死了我父亲
<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>robbed the place, and shot my father.

304
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,630
<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>警察从调查第一天起就认定我是凶手
<13-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>The cops decided on day one that it must have been me.

305
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,010
<13-4,CASTLE>你当时在那吗
<13-4,CASTLE>Were you there?

306
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,270
<13-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我在两千英里外的大学里
<13-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I was at college, 2,000 miles away.

307
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,260
<13-6,CASTLE>我知道你和你父亲的关系
<13-6,CASTLE>I know you and your father didn't have

<13-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我母亲去世后关系又恶化了
<13-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>It only got worse after my mother passed away.

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
<13-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>现在我又重操旧业了  对吧
<13-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>now I've done it again, doesn't she?

314
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,770
<13-10,CASTLE>戴米安  你本应告诉我的
<13-10,CASTLE>Ah, Damian, you should've told me.

315
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,980
<13-10,CASTLE>我不是警察  我是你的朋友
<13-10,CASTLE>I'm not a cop. I'm your friend.

316
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,640
<13-11,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>没错  你是我的朋友
<13-11,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>That's right. You are.

317
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,650
<13-11,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>记得你第一次来艾维克的时候吗
<13-11,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Remember when you first came to edgewyck?

318
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,490
<13-12,CASTLE>我记得
<13-12,CASTLE>I remember.

319
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,190
<13-13,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>是我告诉他们给你一个机会
<13-13,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I was the one that told them to give you a chance.

320
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,810
<13-13,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我现在也渴望一个这样的机会
<13-13,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I'm looking for the same chance now.

321
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,280
<14-1,BECKETT>坎贝尔先生  你和你前妻关系如何
<14-1,BECKETT>Mr. Campbell, how did you get along with your ex-wife?

322
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,890
<14-2,SIMON CAMPBELL>有一阵子不大好  我那时很痛苦
<14-2,SIMON CAMPBELL>Well, it was hard for a while. I was bitter.

323
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,260
<14-2,SIMON CAMPBELL>薇琪为了他离我而去  你知道吗
<14-2,SIMON CAMPBELL>Vicky left me for him, you know?

324
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,800
<14-3,BECKETT>-嗯  -我们有家庭
<14-3,BECKETT>- Mm-hmm.- We had a home.

325
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,110
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>我们有两个进入青春期的孩子
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>We had two kids going into their teens,

326
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,350
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>她却不可救药地爱上了戴米安·韦斯莱
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>and she fell madly in love with Damian Westlake

327
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,280
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>然后离我而去
<14-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>and left me.

328
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,540
<14-5,BECKETT>你了解他吗  关于他的过去
<14-5,BECKETT>And what did you know about him, about his past?

329
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,380
<14-6,SIMON CAMPBELL>我知道他没有工作  我猜他奔着钱来的
<14-6,SIMON CAMPBELL>I know he doesn't work. Comes from money, I guess.

330
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,990
<14-7,BECKETT>-嗯  -典型的从被宠坏的小孩
<14-7,BECKETT>- Mm-hmm.- A typical spoiled child

331
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,550
<14-8,SIMON CAMPBELL>成长为一个娇纵浪荡的男人
<14-8,SIMON CAMPBELL>that grew into a spoiled man.

332
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,600
<14-8,SIMON CAMPBELL>我知道薇琪后悔嫁给了他
<14-8,SIMON CAMPBELL>I know Vicky regretted marrying him.

333
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,650
<14-9,BECKETT>为什么你这么说
<14-9,BECKETT>And why would you say that?

334
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,150
<14-9,BECKETT>薇琪的店铺
<14-9,BECKETT>Vicky's business

335
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,120
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>在我们房子的一楼
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>is on the ground floor of our brownstone.

336
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,490
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>我依然和孩子们住在上面的两层
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>I still live in the top two floors with the kids.

337
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,360
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>我每天都能见到她  听见她哼哼小曲
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>I would see her every day, you know, singing a little tune

338
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,150
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>爱不释手地看着他买给她的小玩意
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>or gazing fondly at some new bauble he had gotten her.

339
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,700
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>没过多久她不怎么唱歌了
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>Then lately, there was less

340
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,080
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>哭声却增多起来
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>singing and more crying.

341
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,440
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>周一时  她告诉我
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>Monday, she told me she

342
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,720
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>她觉得自己犯了个错误
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>thought she had made a mistake.

343
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,640
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>我们甚至谈到了复合
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>We even talked about getting back together.

344
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,030
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>难道你认为她两天后遇害
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>What, you think it's a coincidence

345
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,150
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>是个巧合吗
<14-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>that two days later, she was dead?

346
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,280
<15-1,MARTHA>理查德  我以为你早都睡觉了
<15-1,MARTHA>Richard, I thought you went to bed hours ago.

347
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,650
<15-2,CASTLE>我睡不着
<15-2,CASTLE>Couldn't sleep.

348
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,770
<15-3,MARTHA>睡不着是因为你和贝克特吵了一架
<15-3,MARTHA>Couldn't sleep because of your fight with Beckett

349
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,290
<15-3,MARTHA>还是因为你的老朋友戴米安
<15-3,MARTHA>or because there's a possibility

350
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,810
<15-3,MARTHA>有可能是两起凶杀案的凶手
<15-3,MARTHA>Your old friend Damian may be a double murderer?

351
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,560
<15-4,CASTLE>都有  感谢你这么直言不讳地说出来
<15-4,CASTLE>Both, and thank you for putting it so bluntly.

352
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,050
<15-5,MARTHA>理查德
<15-5,MARTHA>Richard, you know...

353
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,170
<15-6,CASTLE>别  别说出来
<15-6,CASTLE>Don't. Don't say it.

354
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,380
<15-6,CASTLE>我知道你在想什么
<15-6,CASTLE>I know what you're thinking,

355
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,340
<15-6,CASTLE>因为我也在想这个
<15-6,CASTLE>'cause I'm thinking it, too.

356
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,570
<15-6,CASTLE>戴米安的父亲和妻子都因
<15-6,CASTLE>What are the chances Damian's father and wife

357
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,430
<15-6,CASTLE>入室抢劫被害而他却与此毫无关系
<15-6,CASTLE>are both murdered in home invasions,

358
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,110
<15-6,CASTLE>这可能性能有多大
<15-6,CASTLE>but he had nothing to do with 'em?

359
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,910
<15-7,MARTHA>那你怎么认为
<15-7,MARTHA>So what do you think?

360
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,210
<15-8,CASTLE>我只知道  如果他是有罪的
<15-8,CASTLE>I know, if he is guilty,

361
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,260
<15-8,CASTLE>想说服我不仅仅需要一个合理的假设
<15-8,CASTLE>I'll need to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.

362
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,710
<15-8,CASTLE>我得看到实实在在的证据
<15-8,CASTLE>I will need solid evidence,

363
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,750
<15-8,CASTLE>不仅仅靠巧合和猜测
<15-8,CASTLE>not just coincidence and speculation.

364
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,920
<15-9,MARTHA>你难道见过贝克特
<15-9,MARTHA>Have you ever known Beckett

365
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,190
<15-9,MARTHA>仅仅满足于巧合和猜测么
<15-9,MARTHA>to settle for less than that?

366
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,720
<15-10,CASTLE>没有
<15-10,CASTLE>No.

367
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,150
<15-11,MARTHA>我觉得你需要面对事实  孩子
<15-11,MARTHA>Then I think you should face it, kiddo.

368
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,370
<15-11,MARTHA>你欠那个女人一声道歉
<15-11,MARTHA>You may owe that woman an apology...

369
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
<15-11,MARTHA>特别是如果你还想调查此案的话
<15-11,MARTHA>especially if you want to stay on the case.

370
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,620
<16-1,BECKETT>哦  不
<16-1,BECKETT>oh, no.

371
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,150
<16-2,CASTLE>我能帮你一把吗
<16-2,CASTLE>Can I give you a hand with that?

372
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,970
<16-3,BECKETT>我能搞定
<16-3,BECKETT>I got it.

373
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,040
<16-4,CASTLE>你只要... 把那个...
<16-4,CASTLE>You just...all you do...

374
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,440
<16-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我说过我能搞定  好吧
<16-5,BECKETT>Castle, I said I got it. Okay?

375
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,270
<16-6,BECKETT>你来这做什么
<16-6,BECKETT>What are you doing here?

376
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,610
<16-7,CASTLE>当我告诉戴米安
<16-7,CASTLE>When I told Damian

377
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,880
<16-7,CASTLE>纽约市最好的警官负责他妻子的案子时
<16-7,CASTLE>the best detective in New York was working his wife's case,

378
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
<16-7,CASTLE>我说的是真心话
<16-7,CASTLE>I meant it, and I'm...

379
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,530
<16-7,CASTLE>我很抱歉我曾经怀疑过你的能力
<16-7,CASTLE>I'm sorry to have doubted you.

380
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,560
<16-7,CASTLE>如果你让我回归  我保证
<16-7,CASTLE>If you let me back, I promise,

381
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,170
<16-7,CASTLE>我会尽全力保持一个客观的态度
<16-7,CASTLE>I will do my best to remain objective.

382
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,860
<16-8,BECKETT>这可能比你想象中要更难做到
<16-8,BECKETT>Well, that might be harder than you think.

383
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,890
<17-1,BECKETT>韦斯莱家的财务报告
<17-1,BECKETT>The Westlakes' financial records.

384
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,290
<17-1,BECKETT>这是他俩的婚前协定
<17-1,BECKETT>This is their prenuptial agreement,

385
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,220
<17-1,BECKETT>上面明确说如果他们离婚
<17-1,BECKETT>and it's pretty clear that if they got divorced,

386
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,260
<17-1,BECKETT>戴米安一个子儿也得不到  但如果她死了
<17-1,BECKETT>Damian would get nothing, but with her dead,

387
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,170
<17-1,BECKETT>-他会继承一千万美元  -没错
<17-1,BECKETT>- he inherits $10 million.- Yes,

388
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,110
<17-2,CASTLE>但你忘了戴米安已经很富有了
<17-2,CASTLE>but you're forgetting that Damian is already rich...

389
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,180
<17-2,CASTLE>他父亲死后继承的钱
<17-2,CASTLE>the money he got when his father died.

390
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,940
<17-3,RYAN>是他父亲被谋杀后
<17-3,RYAN>When his father was murdered,

391
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,060
<17-3,RYAN>而且  那笔钱也已经花完了
<17-3,RYAN>and also, that money is gone.

392
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,330
<17-3,RYAN>戴米安用他的最后一笔现金来讨薇琪欢心了
<17-3,RYAN>Last of his cash, Damian spent wooing Vicky.

393
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,330
<17-3,RYAN>他用昂贵的礼物将她哄的团团转
<17-3,RYAN>He showered her with expensive presents...

394
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,450
<17-3,RYAN>订婚戒指  手链  钻石耳环
<17-3,RYAN>the engagement ring, a tennis bracelet, diamond earrings.

395
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,740
<17-4,BECKETT>等到他们结婚的时候
<17-4,BECKETT>And then by the time they got married,

396
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,410
<17-4,BECKETT>戴米安的钱全都花光了
<17-4,BECKETT>Damian was tapped out of money.

397
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,890
<17-4,BECKETT>是薇琪付的所有账单
<17-4,BECKETT>Vicky was paying for all the bills.

398
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,520
<17-5,RYAN>根据戴米安的信用卡收据
<17-5,RYAN>According to Damian's credit card receipts,

399
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,990
<17-5,RYAN>他用她的钱买上等苏格兰威士忌
<17-5,RYAN>he spent her money on good scotch,

400
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,400
<17-5,RYAN>剧院头等包厢和古巴雪茄
<17-5,RYAN>box seats, and cuban cigars.

401
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,680
<17-5,RYAN>于此同时  她绝大多数钱
<17-5,RYAN>Meanwhile, most of her charges are

402
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,960
<17-5,RYAN>花在她的设计事业上了
<17-5,RYAN>for her design business...

403
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,350
<17-5,RYAN>-一个叫鉴赏者的破地方  还有再塑者  -于是呢
<17-5,RYAN>-APPRAISER, a rug place, REFINISHER... - so?

404
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,320
<17-7,BECKETT>也许薇琪厌倦了做他的提款机
<17-7,BECKETT>So maybe Vicky got tired of being his A.T.M.

405
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,430
<17-7,BECKETT>也许她威胁他
<17-7,BECKETT>Maybe she threatened

406
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,050
<17-7,BECKETT>她要像他父亲那样与他断交
<17-7,BECKETT>to cut him off just like his father did.

407
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,350
<17-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我看过
<17-7,BECKETT>Castle, I read the

408
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,890
<17-7,BECKETT>菲利普·韦斯莱案子的卷宗了
<17-7,BECKETT>Philip Westlake case files.

409
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,780
<17-7,BECKETT>警察可以确定就是他干的
<17-7,BECKETT>The cops were sure it was him.

410
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,970
<17-8,CASTLE>没错  但他们错了  就像你现在也错了
<17-8,CASTLE>Yes, but they were wrong, just like you're wrong now.

411
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,920
<17-9,BECKETT>抱歉  难道你这是在保持一个客观的态度吗
<17-9,BECKETT>Oh, I'm sorry. Is this you being objective

412
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,100
<17-9,BECKETT>还是在不干涉我的破案工作
<17-9,BECKETT>or is this you staying out of my way?

413
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,100
<17-10,CASTLE>我这是在说
<17-10,CASTLE>This is me saying,

414
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,040
<17-10,CASTLE>也许我们可以稍微扩大一下嫌疑犯的范围
<17-10,CASTLE>maybe we could broaden our suspect pool a little bit.

440
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,430
<19-1,OMAR LINCOLN>好吧  我确实在房子里  但是我可没杀她
<19-1,OMAR LINCOLN>Okay, I was at the house, yeah. But I didn't kill her.

441
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,410
<19-2,ESPOSITO>我觉得事情是这样的  奥马
<19-2,ESPOSITO>Here's what I think happened, Omar.

442
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,290
<19-2,ESPOSITO>你回到那面墙上涂鸦
<19-2,ESPOSITO>You were back there tagging the wall.

443
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,580
<19-2,ESPOSITO>韦斯莱夫人打开门看见了你
<19-2,ESPOSITO>Mrs. Westlake opens the door and sees you.

444
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,700
<19-2,ESPOSITO>你把她推到里面去
<19-2,ESPOSITO>You shove her inside and

445
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,040
<19-2,ESPOSITO>抓起你能找到的第一把武器
<19-2,ESPOSITO>you grab the first weapon you find

446
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,600
<19-2,ESPOSITO>这样她才不敢报警
<19-2,ESPOSITO>so that she doesn't call the cops

447
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,980
<19-2,ESPOSITO>而你也不会在保释期再次被抓
<19-2,ESPOSITO>and you don't get busted on your parole.

448
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,500
<19-3,OMAR LINCOLN>不不  听着  我是在那扇墙上涂鸦了
<19-3,OMAR LINCOLN>No, no. Look, I tagged the wall.

449
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,100
<19-3,OMAR LINCOLN>那之后  我去六十三大街的花店了
<19-3,OMAR LINCOLN>Right after that, I hit the flower shop on 63rd.

<19-5,OMAR LINCOLN>Quarter to 5:00, about.

455
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,530
<19-5,OMAR LINCOLN>你们只要不以破坏公物罪起诉我
<19-5,OMAR LINCOLN>You make this vandalism charge go away,

456
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,880

<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>我听见他们两个吵架了
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>I heard them two fighting.

462
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,750
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>整条公园大道都能听到那娘们的声音
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>I mean, beezy had her park avenue on.

463
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,750
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>"你是个大骗子  你是窃贼
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>"You're a liar. You're a thief.

464

<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>我真后悔当初遇见你  我要离婚"
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>I'm sorry I ever met you. I want a divorce."

465
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,490

<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>If I was him, I woulda killed her, too,

466
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,980
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>就为了让她把嘴闭上
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>just to shut her up.

467
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,770
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>我的意思是...
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>I... I mean...

468
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,240
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>这句话别写上去
<19-10,OMAR LINCOLN>Don't write that.

469
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,580
<20-1,CASTLE>我不敢相信你竟然相信了奥马·林肯的话
<20-1,CASTLE>I can't believe you're taking Omar Lincoln at his word.

470
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,480
<20-2,ESPOSITO>我是相信丹·萨缪尔斯的话
<20-2,ESPOSITO>I'm taking the word of Dan Samuels,

471
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,540
<20-2,ESPOSITO>他证实下午四点五十的时候  他在他的花店
<20-2,ESPOSITO>who confirms, at 4:50 P.M., he was at his flower shop

472
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,900
<20-2,ESPOSITO>拿一把0.38口径的枪指着奥马·林肯
<20-2,ESPOSITO>pointing a .38 at Omar Lincoln,

473
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,770
<20-2,ESPOSITO>之后奥马向北跑去
<20-2,ESPOSITO>and that Omar ran north,

474
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,950
<20-2,ESPOSITO>这正好是和韦斯莱家
<20-2,ESPOSITO>which is in the opposite direction

475
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,620
<20-2,ESPOSITO>相反的方向
<20-2,ESPOSITO>of the westlakes' townhome.

476
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,010
<20-3,CASTLE>没错  但他也许又折回来...
<20-3,CASTLE>Yes, but maybe he doubled back...

477
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,460
<20-4,ESPOSITO>奥马说他无意中听到韦斯莱一家
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Omar says that he overheard the Westlakes

478
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,110
<20-4,ESPOSITO>发生了激烈的争吵
<20-4,ESPOSITO>having a knock-down-drag-out,

479
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,220
<20-4,ESPOSITO>而且她提到了离婚
<20-4,ESPOSITO>and that she used the "D" Word.

480
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,070
<20-5,BECKETT>戴米安告诉我们他们俩没有矛盾
<20-5,BECKETT>Damian told us that things were fine between them

481
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,780
<20-5,BECKETT>薇琪对他说的最后一句话是
<20-5,BECKETT>and that the last thing that Vicky said to him

482
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,050
<20-5,BECKETT>"好好玩吧"
<20-5,BECKETT>was "have a good game."

483

<20-6,CASTLE>-他们吵架了  -两口子没有不吵架的
<20-6,CASTLE>- They had a fight. - Married people fight.

484
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,840
<20-7,BECKETT>那为什么戴米安要对我们撒谎
<20-7,BECKETT>Well, then why did Damian lie to us about it?

485
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,060
<20-8,CASTLE>也许他害怕你
<20-8,CASTLE>Maybe he was afraid you'd, I don't know,

486
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,780
<20-8,CASTLE>把他列为犯罪嫌疑人
<20-8,CASTLE>suspect him of murder.

487
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,550
<20-9,BECKETT>或许他害怕
<20-9,BECKETT>Or maybe he was afraid

488
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,980
<20-9,BECKETT>我们查出来吵架的原因
<20-9,BECKETT>that we'd figure out what the fight was about.

489
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,520
<20-9,BECKETT>这些是戴米安的信用卡消费记录
<20-9,BECKETT>These are Damian's credit card charges.

490
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,770
<20-10,CASTLE>没错  我们查过了
<20-10,CASTLE>Yeah, we went over those.

<20-10,CASTLE>Uh, cigars, scotch, box seats.

492
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,820
<20-11,RYAN>这是另外一张卡  费了点劲才找到
<20-11,RYAN>This is a different card. Took us a while to find it

493
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,600
<20-11,RYAN>因为戴米安是用他的
<20-11,RYAN>because Damian paid the

494
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,050
<20-11,RYAN>私房零花钱账户结的账
<20-11,RYAN>bill from a pocket account,

495
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,030
<20-11,RYAN>他将此事瞒着薇琪
<20-11,RYAN>and he kept it a secret from Vicky.

496
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,070
<20-12,BECKETT>根据消费记录
<20-12,BECKETT>And given the charges,

497
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,590
<20-12,BECKETT>我很肯定他还隐瞒了其他事
<20-12,BECKETT>I'm sure he's keeping other secrets.

498
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,620
<20-12,BECKETT>有一个花店  还有购物中心里的几家珠宝店
<20-12,BECKETT>There's a florist, some jewelry store at the mall,

499
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,770
<20-12,BECKETT>他还在男性俱乐部租了一间娱乐室
<20-12,BECKETT>and he rented a playroom at the varick club

500
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,720
<20-13,RYAN>-每周至少去一次  -娱乐室里面有什么
<20-13,RYAN>- at least once a week. - What's in a playroom?

501
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,300
<20-14,CASTLE>顶多就是一张床什么的
<20-14,CASTLE>Not much more than a bed.

502
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,090
<20-15,CASTLE>没错  我也是俱乐部的会员
<20-15,CASTLE>Yes, I'm a member.

503
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,050
<20-16,RYAN>那戴米安为什么在城里有一座好房子的
<20-16,RYAN>So why would Damian rent a bed

504
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,340
<20-16,RYAN>情况下还要租一张床呢
<20-16,RYAN>when he had a nice big town house?

505
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,540
<20-17,CASTLE>肯定会有一个合乎情理的解释
<20-17,CASTLE>There's gotta be a..a reasonable explanation.

506
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,210
<20-18,BECKETT>那让我们看看能不能找到吧
<20-18,BECKETT>Well, let's go see if we can find it.

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,470
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>我们本不应该干涉会员的私事
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>We're not supposed to get involved with members,

517
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,050
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>尤其是已婚会员
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>especially married members.

518
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,230
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>但戴米安
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>But Damian...

519
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,880
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>我们情不自禁坠入情网
<22-1,CALLIE LANGSTON>We couldn't help it. We fell in love.

520
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,840
<22-2,BECKETT>他有说过要离开他妻子吗
<22-2,BECKETT>Did he tell you that he planned on leaving his wife?

521
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,120
<22-4,BECKETT>他有告诉你关于钱的问题吗
<22-4,BECKETT>Did he tell you about the problems with the money?

522
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,080
<22-5,CALLIE LANGSTON>没有  但韦斯莱夫人告诉我了
<22-5,CALLIE LANGSTON>N-no. Uh, Mrs. Westlake did.

523
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,110
<22-6,CASTLE>你跟韦斯莱夫人谈过了
<22-6,CASTLE>You spoke to Mrs. Westlake?

524
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,930
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>她星期三上午过来的
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>She came to the club Wednesday morning.

525
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,860
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>说她已知道戴米安和我的私情
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>She said that she had figured it out, about Damian and me,

526
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,560
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>她想警告我
<22-7,CALLIE LANGSTON>and she wanted to warn me.

527
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,790
<22-8,CASTLE>警告什么
<22-8,CASTLE>About what?

528
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,920
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>韦斯莱夫人说她要离开戴米安
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>Mrs.Westlake said that, she was going to leave Damian,

529
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,550
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>他一分钱也得不到
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>and then he wouldn't have any money.

530
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,230
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>她说他没有钱就活不了
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>She said he couldn't live without money,

531
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,600
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>因此他会再找一个
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>so he would find someone else.

532
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,500
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>可以养他的女人
<22-9,CALLIE LANGSTON>You know, a woman who could support him.

533
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,740
<22-10,BECKETT>你有告诉戴米安
<22-10,BECKETT>And did you tell Damian

534
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,900
<22-10,BECKETT>你和他妻子的谈话吗
<22-10,BECKETT>about the conversation you had with his wife?

535
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,680
<22-11,BECKETT>他对此说了什么
<22-11,BECKETT>And what did he say?

536
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,640
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>他说他爱我
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>He said he loved me

537
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,510
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>什么也不能将我们分开
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>and that nothing would keep us apart.

538
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,680
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>接着我就在新闻上听到韦斯莱夫人出事了
<22-12,CALLIE LANGSTON>Then I heard about Mrs. Westlake on the news.

539
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,230
<22-13,BECKETT>在你听到戴米安妻子的谋杀案后
<22-13,BECKETT>Did you talk to Damian

540
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,450
<22-13,BECKETT>你有和他谈过吗
<22-13,BECKETT>after you heard about his wife's murder?

541
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,870
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>只谈过一次
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>Just once.

542
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,940
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>他说我们近期不要见面了
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>He said we couldn't see each other for a while,

543
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,860
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>直到一切风平浪静后
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>until things calmed down.

544
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,650
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>他说不是他干的
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>He told me that he didn't do it.

545
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,370
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>但他又说  如果警察问起他
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>But then he said, you know, if the cops ask me,

546
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,350
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>我得说我们没有在一起
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>that I should say that we weren't together...

547
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,140
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>否则这对他很不利
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>That it could make him look bad.

548
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,470
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>我该怎么想呢
<22-14,CALLIE LANGSTON>What am I supposed to think?

549
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,760
<23-1,BECKETT>凯莉的不在场证据证实了
<23-1,BECKETT>Callie's alibi checks out.

550
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,420
<23-1,BECKETT>她周三一直工作到晚上7点
<23-1,BECKETT>She was at work on Wednesday until 7:00 P.M.

551
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,680
<23-1,BECKETT>警员正带戴米安过来
<23-1,BECKETT>Uniforms are bringing Damian in now.

552
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,640
<23-1,BECKETT>听着
<23-1,BECKETT>Look...

553
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,440
<23-2,CASTLE>也许戴米安是个白眼狼
<23-2,CASTLE>Maybe Damian is a cheater

554
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,740
<23-2,CASTLE>拆白党  黄世仁
<23-2,CASTLE>and a bum and a bad husband.

555
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,610
<23-4,CASTLE>-也许吗  -但这并不意味他是凶手
<23-4,CASTLE>- Maybe?  - But that doesn't make him a killer.

556
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,570
<23-4,CASTLE>你这样看着我
<23-4,CASTLE>And you keep looking at me

557
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,080
<23-4,CASTLE>好像我疯了才相信他
<23-4,CASTLE>like I'm crazy for believing in him,

558
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,710
<23-4,CASTLE>但这只是因为你不了解他
<23-4,CASTLE>but that's just because you don't know him.

559
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,390
<23-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你也不了解他
<23-5,BECKETT>Castle, neither do you.

560
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,960
<23-5,BECKETT>你自认为了解的戴米安并不存在
<23-5,BECKETT>The Damian that you think you know doesn't exist.

561
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,200
<23-5,BECKETT>他是你臆造的
<23-5,BECKETT>You made him up,

562
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,170
<23-5,BECKETT>就像你臆造的德里克·斯道姆
<23-5,BECKETT>just like you made up Derrick Storm,

563
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,130
<23-5,BECKETT>也像是你臆造的妮基·希特
<23-5,BECKETT>just like you made up Nikki Heat.

564
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,020
<23-5,BECKETT>他只不过是你14岁时思家心切
<23-5,BECKETT>He's a character in a story that you told yourself

565
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,110
<23-5,BECKETT>所创造出来的一个故事人物
<23-5,BECKETT>when you were a homesick 14-year-old little boy.

566
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,670
<23-5,BECKETT>也许是时候让他离开了
<23-5,BECKETT>Maybe it's time to let him go.

567
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,350
<23-6,BECKETT>你可以在观察室看
<23-6,BECKETT>You can watch from observation.

568
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,190
<23-6,BECKETT>你也不会想在场的
<23-6,BECKETT>You don't want to be in there for this.

569
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,020
<24-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>人们总跟我说该请个律师
<24-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>You know, people keep telling me I should hire a lawyer.

570
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,080
<24-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我说我是清白的  我不需要律师
<24-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I say, I'm innocent. I-I shouldn't need a lawyer.

571
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,000
<24-2,BECKETT>如果你是清白的  韦斯莱先生
<24-2,BECKETT>If you're innocent, Mr. Westlake, why is it

572
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,900
<24-2,BECKETT>为什么每一次我翻看这件案子
<24-2,BECKETT>every time I turn over a rock in this case,

573
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,710
<24-2,BECKETT>总能发现一些龌龊的秘密
<24-2,BECKETT>some dirty secret of yours slithers out?

574
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,250
<24-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我没杀人
<24-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I didn't do this.

575
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,180
<24-4,BECKETT>你在波多黎各也是这么跟警察说的
<24-4,BECKETT>That's what you said to the cops in Puerto Rico, too.

576
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,050
<24-4,BECKETT>总让自己深陷同样的窘境
<24-4,BECKETT>Isn't funny how you keep finding yourself

577
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,500
<24-4,BECKETT>说着同样的故事  不可笑吗
<24-4,BECKETT>in the same situation, telling the same stories?

578
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,680
<24-4,BECKETT>我也有个故事  想听听吗
<24-4,BECKETT>I've got a story, too. You want to hear it?

579
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,610
<24-4,BECKETT>一个英俊的小王子
<24-4,BECKETT>My story is about a handsome little prince

580
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,630
<24-4,BECKETT>只想过锦衣玉食的生活
<24-4,BECKETT>who only ever wanted to live well,

581
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,520
<24-4,BECKETT>所以他杀了自己的父亲  就是国王
<24-4,BECKETT>so he killed his dad, the king,

582
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,590
<24-4,BECKETT>偷了他所有的金子
<24-4,BECKETT>and he stole all of his gold, and he spent it

583
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,290
<24-4,BECKETT>花啊花  直至挥霍一空
<24-4,BECKETT>and he spent it until it was all gone.

584
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,720
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我不是为了钱才娶薇琪的
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I didn't marry Vicky for her money.

585
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,850
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我爱她
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I loved her.

586
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,420
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>那凯莉呢
<24-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>And what about Callie?

587
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,720
<24-6,BECKETT>戴米安  我们跟她谈过了
<24-6,BECKETT>Told you, Damian. We talked to her.

588
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,340
<24-6,BECKETT>她说你爱的是她
<24-6,BECKETT>She said that you were in love with her

589
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,720
<24-6,BECKETT>你还告诉她
<24-6,BECKETT>and that you told her

590
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,930
<24-6,BECKETT>你想和她在一起
<24-6,BECKETT>that you wanted the two of you to be together.

591
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,850
<24-6,BECKETT>薇琪很快就会离开你的
<24-6,BECKETT>Vicky was leaving you soon.

592
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,630
<24-6,BECKETT>然后就可以自由享受你们的幸福了
<24-6,BECKETT>You'd be free to have your happily ever after.

593
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,270
<24-6,BECKETT>但有个问题
<24-6,BECKETT>But there's just one problem.

594
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,020
<24-6,BECKETT>再一次  你身无分文
<24-6,BECKETT>Once again... You were out of gold.

595
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,310
<24-6,BECKETT>薇琪阻碍了你的财路
<24-6,BECKETT>Vicky stood between you and a fortune.

596
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,510
<24-6,BECKETT>我们都清楚  人为了钱会不择手段
<24-6,BECKETT>And we know what happens to people when they do that.

597
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,760
<24-6,BECKETT>你是她生前最后一位见到的人
<24-6,BECKETT>You were the last one to see her alive.

598
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,330
<24-6,BECKETT>你是唯一有动机的人
<24-6,BECKETT>You were the only one with motive.

599
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,010
<24-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>但我没杀她
<24-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>But I didn't kill her!

600
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,370
<24-8,BECKETT>戴米安·韦斯莱
<24-8,BECKETT>Damian Westlake,

601
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
<24-8,BECKETT>你以谋杀维多利亚·韦斯莱
<24-8,BECKETT>you are under arrest...

602
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,260
<24-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>你搞错了
<24-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>You're making a mistake.

603
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,150
<24-10,BECKETT>的罪名被逮捕
<24-10,BECKETT>for the murder of Victoria Westlake.

604
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,300
<24-12,BECKETT>-你有权保持沉默  -我没杀人
<24-12,BECKETT>- You have the right to remain silent.  - I didn't do this.

605
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,410
<24-12,BECKETT>你有权请律师  如果你请不起
<24-12,BECKETT>You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot...

606
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,850
<25-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯起来走了
<25-1,CASTLE>Alexis up and gone already?

607
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,850
<25-2,MARTHA>是啊  她想在小提琴课之前
<25-2,MARTHA>Oh, yeah. She wanted to

608

<25-2,MARTHA>去商店展柜看看过个眼瘾
<25-2,MARTHA>window shop before her violin lesson.

609
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,940
<25-2,MARTHA>这是她和阿什利的第一个情人节
<25-2,MARTHA>It's her first valentine's day with Ashley,

610
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,850
<25-2,MARTHA>-她倍感压力  -是吗
<25-2,MARTHA>- and she's feeling the pressure.  - Ah, yes.

611
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,960
<25-3,CASTLE>她想要个礼物表明我爱你
<25-3,CASTLE>She wants a gift that says "I love you,"

612
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,950
<25-3,CASTLE>但没有什么可以表明
<25-3,CASTLE>But nothing that says,

613
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,210
<25-3,CASTLE>我爱你胜过一切
<25-3,CASTLE>"I love you more than life itself.

614
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,640
<25-3,CASTLE>请别离开我  否则我活不下去
<25-3,CASTLE>Please don't leave me or I may die."

615
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,330
<25-4,MARTHA>所以你们这些人
<25-4,MARTHA>Well, that's why you guys go

616
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,030
<25-4,MARTHA>就买巧克力和花
<25-4,MARTHA>for the chocolates and the flowers.

617
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,700
<25-5,CASTLE>我今天做的决定要是能这么简单就好了
<25-5,CASTLE>I wish the choice I had to make today was so simple.

618
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,490
<25-5,CASTLE>我意识到
<25-5,CASTLE>I realized, I have the choice

619
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,600
<25-5,CASTLE>我得在两件可怕的事情中选择一样
<25-5,CASTLE>to believe in two terrible things.

620
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,490
<25-5,CASTLE>要么相信戴米安是凶手
<25-5,CASTLE>Either Damian is a killer

621
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,540
<25-5,CASTLE>要么相信贝克特逮捕了一位无辜者
<25-5,CASTLE>or Beckett's arrested an innocent man.

622
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,390
<25-5,CASTLE>想想就头疼
<25-5,CASTLE>Just thinking about it's making my head hurt.

623
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,750
<25-6,MARTHA>那就不要想  倾听自己的心声
<25-6,MARTHA>Well, then forget your head. Listen to your heart.

624
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,850
<26-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>里奇
<26-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Ricky.

625
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,660
<26-2,CASTLE>我一直回想起我高中时
<26-2,CASTLE>I keep thinking back to when I was a senior.

626
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,210
<26-2,CASTLE>你从哈佛辍学
<26-2,CASTLE>You were off at Harvard.

627
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,580
<26-2,CASTLE>你寄给我你写的小说
<26-2,CASTLE>You'd send me pages you were working on for your novel,

628
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,430
<26-2,CASTLE>写得很好  戴米安
<26-2,CASTLE>and they were good, Damian.

629
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,010
<26-2,CASTLE>你才华横溢  却为什么放弃了
<26-2,CASTLE>Man, you had talent. Why'd you throw it away?

630
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,920
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>里奇  你才是作家  我不是
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Ah, you were the writer, Ricky, not me.

631
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,390
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我无话可说
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I didn't have anything to say.

632
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,570
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>在我继承财产后
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>After I inherited all that money,

633
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,810
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我甚至都不想再写了
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I just didn't even want to try anymore.

634
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,030
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>但当我回顾过去的时候
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>But when I look back at my life,

635
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,810
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>希望你别介意
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I hope you won't mind

636
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,660
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我把你当成我的一项成就
<26-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>if I list you as one of my few accomplishments.

637
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,020
<26-4,CASTLE>你应该告诉我凯莉的事
<26-4,CASTLE>You should've told me about Callie.

638
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,950
<26-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我向你发誓  我没杀我妻子
<26-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I swear to you, I didn't kill my wife.

639
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,350
<26-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>好吧
<26-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>All right.

640
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,760
<26-6,CASTLE>你能想想我们还遗漏了什么
<26-6,CASTLE>Can you think of anything we might have overlooked,

641
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,440
<26-6,CASTLE>任何能证明你无罪的线索
<26-6,CASTLE>anything that might speak to your innocence?

642
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,010
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我起晚了  去了健身房
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I slept in, I went to the gym,

643
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,590
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>在西区咖啡店吃了午餐
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I had lunch in a cafe on the west side.

644
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,520
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>当我回到家  薇琪已经在家了
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>When I got home, Vicky was already there.

645
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,980
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>她见过凯莉了
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>She had been to see Callie.

646
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,210
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我们吵了很久
<26-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>We fought--god--for hours.

647
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,010
<26-8,CASTLE>她说她要离婚
<26-8,CASTLE>She said she wanted a divorce.

648
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,160
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>是的  她给我看了一个信封
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Yeah, she--she showed me an envelope

649
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,830
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>说里面装着律师起草好
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>and said there were papers inside that her lawyer

650
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,520
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>等她签名的文件
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>had drawn up for her to sign.

651
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,440
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>她要结束这场婚姻
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>She was gonna end the marriage.

652
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,120
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我乞求她重新考虑
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I begged her to reconsider,

653
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,310
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>但她叫我离开
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>and she asked me to leave.

654
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,660
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>她需要想想
<26-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>She needed to think.

655
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,790
<26-10,CASTLE>你说薇琪给你一个信封
<26-10,CASTLE>You said Vicky gave you an envelope?

656
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,650
<26-10,CASTLE>长什么样
<26-10,CASTLE>What'd it look like?

657
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,870
<27-1,BLANCA>我还得回去工作
<27-1,BLANCA>I gotta get back to my route.

658
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,670
<27-2,CASTLE>只要5分钟  我保证
<27-2,CASTLE>Just five minutes, I promise.

659
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,030
<27-2,CASTLE>你好  你好
<27-2,CASTLE>Ah. Hello, hello.

660
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,980
<27-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<27-3,BECKETT>Castle?

661
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,370
<27-4,CASTLE>各位  这是布兰卡
<27-4,CASTLE>Everyone, this is Blanca.

662
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,000
<27-5,ESPOSITO>你好  您来这里有何贵干
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Hola. Que estas haciendo aqui?

663
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,930
<27-6,BLANCA>是这个疯小伙子把我拉来的
<27-6,BLANCA>Este loco me hizo venir conmiel.

664
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,790
<27-7,ESPOSITO>很抱歉  祝你好运
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Ah. Lo siento. Buena suerte.

665
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,050
<27-7,ESPOSITO>没错  我不懂你说什么
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I don't-- I don't know what...

666
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,900
<27-8,CASTLE>首先
<27-8,CASTLE>So first of all,

667
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,390
<27-8,CASTLE>你是对的
<27-8,CASTLE>You were right.

668
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,240
<27-8,CASTLE>薇琪死的当晚  戴米安的确和她吵过架
<27-8,CASTLE>Damian and Vicky did have a fight the night she died.

669
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,840
<26-8,CASTLE>她的确说过要离婚
<26-8,CASTLE>And she did tell him she wanted a divorce.

670
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,170
<27-8,CASTLE>事实上
<27-8,CASTLE>As a matter of fact,

671
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,520
<27-8,CASTLE>她亮出一个大信封  装满了
<27-8,CASTLE>She showed him a large manila envelope full of papers

672
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,230
<27-8,CASTLE>她即将签字的法律文件
<27-8,CASTLE>from her lawyer that she was going to sign.

673
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,180
<27-9,BECKETT>装有法律文件的信封
<27-9,BECKETT>An envelope with legal papers?

674
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,180
<27-9,BECKETT>鉴证组的报告没提这事
<27-9,BECKETT>There wasn't anything about this in the C.S.U. Report.

675
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,840
<27-9,BECKETT>没错
<27-9,BECKETT>Exactly.

676
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,390
<27-10,CASTLE>布兰卡  请告诉他们发生了什么事
<27-10,CASTLE>Blanca, please tell them what happened to it.

677
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,260
<27-11,BLANCA>然后我就可以回去了
<27-11,BLANCA>Then I could go back to my route?

678
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,730
<27-12,CASTLE>当然
<27-12,CASTLE>Yes, of course.

679
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,060
<27-13,BLANCA>我星期三下午正在送信
<27-13,BLANCA>I was delivering the mail on Wednesday afternoon.

680
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,460
<27-13,BLANCA>当我沿着69街往公园方向走时
<27-13,BLANCA>As I made my way up 69th towards park, I passed

681
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,570
<27-13,BLANCA>遇到韦斯莱和厄特利先生  打了招呼
<27-13,BLANCA>Mr. Westlake and Mr. Utley. I said hello.

682
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,730
<27-13,BLANCA>他们也向我问好  几分钟后
<27-13,BLANCA>They said hello back. A couple of minutes later,

683
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,960
<27-13,BLANCA>我来到韦斯莱家  门开了
<27-13,BLANCA>I get to the Westlakes' residence, the door opens,

684
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,290
<27-13,BLANCA>韦斯莱夫人跑出来
<27-13,BLANCA>Mrs. Westlake comes running out

685
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,380
<27-13,BLANCA>给我一个大信封
<27-13,BLANCA>and hands me a large manila envelope.

686
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,600
<27-13,BLANCA>她说要确保
<27-13,BLANCA>She said she wanted to make sure

687
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,050
<27-13,BLANCA>和当天的信件一起寄出去
<27-13,BLANCA>it went out in that day's mail.

688
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,070
<27-14,BECKETT>等等  你确信
<27-14,BECKETT>Wait a minute. So you're positive

689
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,630
<27-14,BECKETT>你见到戴米安后见到韦斯莱夫人
<27-14,BECKETT>that you saw Mrs. Westlake after you saw Damian?

690
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,640
<27-15,BLANCA>女士  我再确信不过了
<27-15,BLANCA>Lady, I couldn't be more sure.

691
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,070
<27-16,CASTLE>-还有其他吗  -就这些  谢谢
<27-16,CASTLE>- Anything else?  - No, that's it. Thank you.

692
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,790
<27-17,BLANCA>-那我走了  -当然可以
<27-17,BLANCA>- Then I'm leaving now.  - Of course.

693
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,900
<27-18,CASTLE>谢谢你  布兰卡
<27-18,CASTLE>Thank you, Blanca.

694
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,450
<27-19,RYAN>戴米安走后  薇琪还是活着的
<27-19,RYAN>So... Vicky was alive after Damian left the house.

695
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,530
<27-20,ESPOSITO>他一直和查尔斯·厄特利在一起
<27-20,ESPOSITO>and he was with Charles Utley

696
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,370
<27-20,ESPOSITO>直到他们回来发现她死了
<27-20,ESPOSITO>until they came back and found her dead.

697
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,200
<27-21,CASTLE>也就是说
<27-21,CASTLE>Which means...

698
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,710
<27-22,BECKETT>戴米安不可能杀她
<27-22,BECKETT>Damian couldn't have killed her.

699
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,860
<27-22,BECKETT>收到
<27-22,BECKETT>Got it.

700
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,340
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>检察官刚把戴米安·韦斯莱放了
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>The D.A.'s office just kicked Damian Westlake loose.

701
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,730
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>他们对此也不是太乐意
<28-1,MONTGOMERY>And they weren't too happy about it either.

702
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,150
<28-2,BECKETT>长官  如果不是韦斯莱杀的
<28-2,BECKETT>Sir, if Westlake didn't do it,

703
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,040
<28-2,BECKETT>那就是他雇凶杀人
<28-2,BECKETT>then he hired someone else to do it for him,

704
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,470
<28-2,BECKETT>-一如他之前的手法  -你不是说
<28-2,BECKETT>- Just like he did the last time.  - Wasn't it you that said

705
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,220
<28-3,CASTLE>坏人总是亲自动手吗
<28-3,CASTLE>that bad guys always bring their own weapons?

706
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,120
<28-4,BECKETT>当他们想伪装成
<28-4,BECKETT>Not when they want it to look

707
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,550
<28-4,BECKETT>入室抢劫时就不是这样
<28-4,BECKETT>like a push-in robbery gone wrong.

708
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,840
<28-5,CASTLE>那狗没叫又怎么解释
<28-5,CASTLE>What about the dog that didn't bark?

709
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,000
<28-6,BECKETT>他让狗熟悉这个人
<28-6,BECKETT>He got the dog used to the guy.

710
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,920
<28-7,CASTLE>得了吧  你就是抓住
<28-7,CASTLE>Come on. You just can't get over the fact

711
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,420
<28-7,CASTLE>戴米安是他父亲谋杀案
<28-7,CASTLE>That Damian was a person of

712
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,110
<28-7,CASTLE>的嫌疑人不放
<28-7,CASTLE>interest in his father's murder.

713
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,420
<28-8,BECKETT>我不能忽视这里有个作案模式
<28-8,BECKETT>I won't ignore the fact that there is a pattern here.

714
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,880
<28-8,BECKETT>和这家伙亲近的人死的很惨
<28-8,BECKETT>People close to this guy seem to die violently.

715
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,190
<28-9,CASTLE>也许是有人利用戴米安悲惨的过去
<28-9,CASTLE>Or maybe someone is using Damian's tragic past

716
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,780
<28-9,CASTLE>陷害他杀了薇琪
<28-9,CASTLE>to frame him for Vicky's murder.

717
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
<28-9,CASTLE>现在有另一个嫌疑人摆在你面前
<28-9,CASTLE>Now there's another suspect right in front of you

718
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,270
<28-9,CASTLE>你连看都不看  他有动机
<28-9,CASTLE>that you're not even looking at--someone who had motive,

719
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,330
<28-9,CASTLE>手法和时机
<28-9,CASTLE>Means, and opportunity.

720
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,870
<28-10,BECKETT>那人到底是谁呢
<28-10,BECKETT>And that would be whom exactly?

721
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,380
<28-10,BECKETT>西蒙·坎贝尔
<28-10,BECKETT>Simon Campbell

722
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,100
<28-11,CASTLE>薇琪的前夫
<28-11,CASTLE>Vicky's ex-husband.

723
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,140
<28-11,CASTLE>想想看
<28-11,CASTLE>Think about it.

724
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:58,500
<28-11,CASTLE>被甩又被戴绿帽子的西蒙
<28-11,CASTLE>Abandoned, cuckolded Simon--

725
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,360
<28-11,CASTLE>我们了解他吗
<28-11,CASTLE>do we really know this guy?

726
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,320
<28-11,CASTLE>我们了解他的能力吗
<28-11,CASTLE>Do we have any idea what he's capable of?

727
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,300
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>我们了解吗
<28-12,MONTGOMERY>Well, do we?

728
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,900
<28-13,BECKETT>所有的证据都指向戴米安
<28-13,BECKETT>All the evidence points to Damian.

729
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,920
<28-14,CASTLE>是的  但如果戴米安没有旧谋杀案缠身
<28-14,CASTLE>Yes, but wouldn't that evidence be less conclusive

730
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,990
<28-14,CASTLE>证据还会像
<28-14,CASTLE>if Damian didn't have this

731
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
<28-14,CASTLE>现在这么确凿吗
<28-14,CASTLE>old murder hanging over his head,

732
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,060
<28-14,CASTLE>或者更好是  若有证据显示菲利普·韦斯莱
<28-14,CASTLE>or better yet, if there was proof that Philip Westlake

733
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,230
<28-14,CASTLE>是被入室窃贼杀死的呢
<28-14,CASTLE>Was killed by a random intruder?

734
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,900
<28-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没有证据
<28-15,BECKETT>Castle, there isn't any proof.

735
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,460
<28-16,CASTLE>还没有证据
<28-16,CASTLE>Not yet, there isn't.

736
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,630
<28-16,CASTLE>既然你不能拨开围绕戴米安的疑云
<28-16,CASTLE>Since you can't see through the cloud of suspicion

737
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,720
<28-16,CASTLE>那我来拨开云雾见青天吧
<28-16,CASTLE>surrounding Damian, I'm gonna clear the air.

738
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,510
<28-16,CASTLE>我要破掉菲利普·韦斯莱的谋杀案
<28-16,CASTLE>I'm gonna solve Philip Westlake's murder,

739
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,490
<28-16,CASTLE>证明我的朋友没杀人
<28-16,CASTLE>prove my friend didn't do it.

740
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,680
<28-16,CASTLE>与此同时  你可以查查西蒙·坎贝尔
<28-16,CASTLE>Meanwhile, you can check out Simon Campbell.

741
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,270
<28-17,MONTGOMERY>我需要确凿证据去找检察官
<28-17,MONTGOMERY>I need to go to the D.A. with something solid.

742
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,050
<28-17,MONTGOMERY>你能证明韦斯莱雇凶杀死他妻子吗
<28-17,MONTGOMERY>Can you prove Westlake hired somebody to off his wife?

743
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,680
<28-18,BECKETT>我需要一些时间
<28-18,BECKETT>I just need a couple of days.

744
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,220
<28-19,RYAN>那我们下一步该怎么办
<28-19,RYAN>So what's our next move?

745
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,700
<28-19,RYAN>如果戴米安雇凶杀死薇琪
<28-19,RYAN>If Damian hired someone to kill Vicky,

746
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,890
<28-19,RYAN>肯定会有钱财线索
<28-19,RYAN>then there's a money trail.

747
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,840
<28-19,RYAN>我去找找
<28-19,RYAN>I'll find it.

748
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,040
<28-19,RYAN>与此同时  你们去查查西蒙·坎贝尔
<28-19,RYAN>Meanwhile, you guys look into Simon Campbell.

749
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,820
<29-1,MARTHA>我肯定他会喜欢的
<29-1,MARTHA>I'm sure he'll love it.

750
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,680
<29-2,CASTLE>-亲爱的  你女儿真是天才  -我早知道了
<29-2,CASTLE>- Darling, your daughter's a genius.  - I knew that already.

751
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,610
<29-3,MARTHA>情人节  她给阿什利买了个相框
<29-3,MARTHA>For valentine's day, she bought Ashley a frame,

752
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,180
<29-3,MARTHA>上面刻着真爱
<29-3,MARTHA>had it engraved "True love,"

753
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,430
<29-3,MARTHA>放上他宠物鼠西奥多的照片
<29-3,MARTHA>and put in a picture of his pet rat--Theodore.

754
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,610
<29-4,CASTLE>诚挚又幽默  天才
<29-4,CASTLE>Heartfelt yet humorous. Genius.

755
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,670
<29-5,ALEXIS>箱子里是什么
<29-5,ALEXIS>What's in the box?

756
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,090
<29-6,CASTLE>菲利普·韦斯莱谋杀案的档案
<29-6,CASTLE>This is Philip Westlake's murder file.

757
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,760
<29-6,CASTLE>我告诉贝克特  我要破掉这案子
<29-6,CASTLE>I told Beckett, I'm gonna solve the case.

758
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,450
<29-7,MARTHA>理查德
<29-7,MARTHA>Oh, Richard.

759
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,060
<29-8,CASTLE>干嘛啊
<29-8,CASTLE>What? You're the one

760
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,520
<29-8,CASTLE>不是你告诉我要听从心声么
<29-8,CASTLE>who told me to follow my heart.

761
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,120
<29-9,MARTHA>话是这么说  但是...
<29-9,MARTHA>Yes, but, you know--

762
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,500
<29-10,ALEXIS>但爸爸  这案子年龄比我还大
<29-10,ALEXIS>Dad, that case is older than me.

763
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,280
<29-11,CASTLE>你们懂不懂爱与支持啊
<29-11,CASTLE>This doesn't sound like encouragement.

764
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,840
<29-12,ALEXIS>那你要我帮忙吗
<29-12,ALEXIS>Then would you like some help?

765
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,840
<29-13,CASTLE>当然要
<29-13,CASTLE>Yes, I would.

766
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,650
<30-1,BECKETT>雇凶杀人  需要钱
<30-1,BECKETT>To hire a gunman, you need cash,

767
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,150
<30-1,BECKETT>但是依据我们手头上
<30-1,BECKETT>and according to everything

768
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,980
<30-1,BECKETT>已经掌握的证据
<30-1,BECKETT>that we've been through here,

769
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,390
<30-1,BECKETT>-戴米安身无分文  -没错
<30-1,BECKETT>- Damian didn't have any.  - Yeah, well,

770
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,790
<30-2,ESPOSITO>可能在某处  我们没找到而已
<30-2,ESPOSITO>it's somewhere. We just haven't found it yet.

771
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,540
<30-3,RYAN>房子里的奢华摆件
<30-3,RYAN>All the expensive knickknacks in that house,

772
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,340
<30-3,RYAN>也许他典当了一件小雕像
<30-3,RYAN>maybe he pawned a figurine.

773
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,140
<30-4,BECKETT>薇琪是位设计师  一丝不苟
<30-4,BECKETT>Vicky was a designer. She was meticulous.

774
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,770
<30-4,BECKETT>如果有东西不见了  她肯定会留意到
<30-4,BECKETT>She would've noticed if something went missing,

775
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,850
<30-4,BECKETT>就比如订婚戒指
<30-4,BECKETT>like the engagement ring.

776
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,760
<30-5,ESPOSITO>想到什么了
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Got something?

777
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,590
<30-6,BECKETT>奥马·林肯听到薇琪说戴米安是个贼
<30-6,BECKETT>Omar Lincoln overheard Vicky call Damian a thief,

778
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:58,270
<30-6,BECKETT>当薇琪向莫里斯·哈斯贝格道歉
<30-6,BECKETT>and when Vicky apologized to Morris Hasberg

779
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,100
<30-6,BECKETT>指控他偷了订婚戒指时
<30-6,BECKETT>for accusing him of stealing her engagement ring,

780
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,800
<30-6,BECKETT>她哭了
<30-6,BECKETT>she cried.

781
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,410
<30-6,BECKETT>也许她并不是因为莫里斯才哭的
<30-6,BECKETT>Maybe she wasn't crying because of Morris.

782
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,870
<30-6,BECKETT>也许是因为她
<30-6,BECKETT>Maybe she was crying because

783
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,070
<30-6,BECKETT>突然意识到她的丈夫
<30-6,BECKETT>she realized that her husband

784
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,120
<30-6,BECKETT>才是小偷
<30-6,BECKETT>was stealing from her.

785
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,120
<30-7,RYAN>鉴证组说正是那枚戒指
<30-7,RYAN>C.S.U. said the ring was accounted for.

786
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,450
<30-8,BECKETT>薇琪的信用卡  不是有一位估价官吗
<30-8,BECKETT>Vicky's credit card--wasn't there an appraiser on it?

787
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,150
<30-9,ESPOSITO>是的  怎么了
<30-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Why?

788
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:16,680
<30-10,BECKETT>我知道戴米安金钱的来路了
<30-10,BECKETT>I think I know how Damian got his money.

789
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,550
<31-1,WALLACE BENNER>太可怕了  韦斯莱女士怎么了
<31-1,WALLACE BENNER>It was terrible, what happened to Mrs. Westlake.

790
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,710
<31-2,BECKETT>她周二下午来找你了
<31-2,BECKETT>She came to see you Tuesday afternoon.

791
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,670
<31-3,RYAN>为了什么事
<31-3,RYAN>What for?

792
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,980
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>噢  她想做珠宝鉴定
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>Oh, she wanted her jewelry appraised.

793
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,810
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>我恐怕鉴定的结果是坏消息
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>I'm afraid I had some bad news for her.

794
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,200
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>钻石是仿冒的  我常看到
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>The stones were imitation. I see that quite a bit.

795
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,620
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>有的人急需要钱
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>People need cash in a hurry,

796
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,140
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>但又不想卖掉珠宝
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>but they don't want to give up their jewelry.

797
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,940
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>于是他们卖掉上面的钻石
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>So they sell the diamonds and they replace them

798
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,760
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>用高质量碳化硅代替
<31-4,WALLACE BENNER>with high-quality silicon carbide.

799
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,660
<31-5,BECKETT>其中是否有十一克拉的订婚戒指
<31-5,BECKETT>Was one of the pieces an 11-carat engagement ring?

800
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,250
<31-6,WALLACE BENNER>没错  整个底座都被更换了
<31-6,WALLACE BENNER>Yes, the entire basket setting had been replaced.

801
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,650
<31-6,WALLACE BENNER>她说就是这样她才发觉不对劲
<31-6,WALLACE BENNER>She said that's how she knew something was wrong.

802
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,540
<32-1,CASTLE>整个案子文档
<32-1,CASTLE>This whole case file

803
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,830
<32-1,CASTLE>又将嫌疑引回戴米安身上
<32-1,CASTLE>is just one long loop leading back to Damian.

804
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,950
<32-2,ALEXIS>显然  邻居看到案发当晚
<32-2,ALEXIS>Apparently, neighbors saw someone loitering

805
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,400
<32-2,ALEXIS>有人在韦斯莱家附近徘徊
<32-2,ALEXIS>outside the Westlake home the night of the murder.

806
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,600
<32-2,ALEXIS>这是嫌犯的画像
<32-2,ALEXIS>Here's a sketch.

807
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,640
<32-2,ALEXIS>怎么了
<32-2,ALEXIS>What?

808
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,360
<32-3,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  我认识这家伙
<32-3,CASTLE>Alexis, I know this guy.

809
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,730
<33-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>贝克特探长
<33-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Detective Beckett.

810
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,200
<33-2,BECKETT>我们能谈谈吗
<33-2,BECKETT>Could we talk for a moment?

811
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,650
<33-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>当然
<33-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Sure.

812
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,480
<34-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>你是来道歉的吗
<34-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Have you come to apologize?

813
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,370
<34-2,BECKETT>不
<34-2,BECKETT>No.

814
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,700
<34-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>至少你很诚实
<34-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>At least you're honest.

815
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,120
<34-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>有什么需要帮忙的  探长
<34-3,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>What can I do for you, detective?

816
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,810
<34-4,BECKETT>你能让我看看你从
<34-4,BECKETT>You could show me the diamonds

817
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,240
<34-4,BECKETT>薇琪那儿偷来的钻石吗
<34-4,BECKETT>that you stole from Vicky.

818
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,480
<34-4,BECKETT>我找过华莱士·本纳了
<34-4,BECKETT>I spoke to Wallace Benner,

819
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,300
<34-4,BECKETT>西边的珠宝商
<34-4,BECKETT>the jeweler on the west side.

820
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,570
<34-4,BECKETT>他说他将你妻子
<34-4,BECKETT>He said that he replaced

821
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,990
<34-4,BECKETT>的钻石换成了仿冒品
<34-4,BECKETT>your wife's diamonds with imitation ones.

822
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,730
<34-4,BECKETT>几周换一次
<34-4,BECKETT>Over a period of several weeks,

823
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,940
<34-4,BECKETT>他替换了二十六颗钻石
<34-4,BECKETT>He exchanged 26 diamonds

824
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,550
<34-4,BECKETT>共价值八百万
<34-4,BECKETT>worth over $8 million

825
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,080
<34-4,BECKETT>真品全在你手上
<34-4,BECKETT>and gave you the real ones.

826
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,140
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>这不是和你的猜测自相矛盾吗
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>But doesn't this argue against your theory

827
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,790
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>说是我杀了她
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>that I killed my wife?

828
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,740
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>要是我有八百万  为什么不跟凯莉
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>If I have $8 million, why wouldn't I just leave,

829
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,630
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>-远走高飞  -贪婪
<34-5,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>- be with Callie? - Greed.

830
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,620
<34-6,BECKETT>你利用第一颗钻石做定金
<34-6,BECKETT>You used the first diamond as a down payment

831
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,820
<34-6,BECKETT>雇了人杀她
<34-6,BECKETT>for the contract to kill her.

832
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,750
<34-6,BECKETT>只要薇琪死了
<34-6,BECKETT>Once Vicky was dead,

833
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,240
<34-6,BECKETT>你就能继承遗产得到双倍的钱
<34-6,BECKETT>you'd inherit and double your take.

834
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,880
<34-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>你真的认为我有这么冷血吗
<34-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>You really think I'm that cold?

835
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,680
<34-8,BECKETT>我个人是这么认为
<34-8,BECKETT>Personally, I have no doubt.

836
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,420
<34-8,BECKETT>但理查德·卡塞尔相信你
<34-8,BECKETT>But Richard Castle believes in you,

837
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,050
<34-8,BECKETT>而我信任他
<34-8,BECKETT>and I believe in him.

838
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,740
<34-8,BECKETT>让我看看那些钻石
<34-8,BECKETT>So show me those diamonds.

839
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,310
<34-8,BECKETT>让我看看它们是否齐全
<34-8,BECKETT>Show me that none of them are missing

840
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,960
<34-8,BECKETT>否则我就再把你关进大牢
<34-8,BECKETT>or I will haul your ass back to jail.

841
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,950
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我只替换了我送给她的钻石
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I only changed the diamonds I had given her.

842
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,180
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>那些珠宝花了我几百万
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Those pieces cost me millions of dollars,

843
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,110
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>而我知道一旦我们离婚
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>and I knew she'd have no

844
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,070
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>这些珠宝对她
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>particular attachment to them

845
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,000
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>不再有意义
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>once we were over.

846
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,280
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我这一辈子
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I've led....

848
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,330
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>但我不是个杀手
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>But I'm no killer.

849
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,170
<34-9,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>二十六颗钻石  全都在这

<35-6,RAY SALAZAR>-这是关于菲利普·韦斯莱的案子  -没错
<35-6,RAY SALAZAR>- this was about the Philip Westlake case? - That's right.

861
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:37,080
<35-8,RAY SALAZAR>我真的很讨厌在退休时留下未破的案子
<35-8,RAY SALAZAR>I really hated leaving the job with that one still unsolved.

862
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,730
<35-9,CASTLE>或许我能帮上忙
<35-9,CASTLE>Well, maybe I can help with that.

863
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,450
<35-9,CASTLE>你知道案发当晚  邻居在
<35-9,CASTLE>Did you ever manage to identify the man

864
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,670

<35-9,CASTLE>that neighbors saw outside the Westlake home

<35-9,CASTLE>- the night of the murder? - Thought we did.

866
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,150
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>那很像是当地的恶棍
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>He looked a lot like a local tough

867
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,940
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>叫做恩里克·莫利纳
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>named Enrique Molina.

868
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,990
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>但当我逮捕莫利纳后
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>But when we brought Molina in,

869
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,730
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>邻居没法指认他
<35-10,RAY SALAZAR>the neighbors couldn't pick him out of a lineup.

870
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,330
<35-11,CASTLE>因为那不是莫利纳
<35-11,CASTLE>That's because it wasn't Molina.

871
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,200
<35-12,RAY SALAZAR>-继续说  -迈克尔·鲁瑟福

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,150
<35-13,CASTLE>在艾维克学院得到了奖学金
<35-13,CASTLE>was a scholarship kid at edgewyck academy,

<35-13,CASTLE>他是戴米安·韦斯莱和我的校友
<35-13,CASTLE>where Damian Westlake and I went to school.

874
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,920
<35-13,CASTLE>他很聪明  但有反社会人格
<35-13,CASTLE>He was smart, but... A sociopath,

875
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,070
<36-2,BECKETT>他是个小偷
<36-2,BECKETT>a thief.

876
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,700
<35-13,CASTLE>很艰难才毕业
<35-13,CASTLE>Kid barely graduated.

877
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,840
<35-14,RAY SALAZAR>卢瑟福和韦斯莱是朋友吗
<35-14,RAY SALAZAR>Were Rutherford and Westlake friends?

878
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,020
<35-15,CASTLE>不  事实上  就是戴米安向校长
<35-15,CASTLE>No. As a matter of fact, it was Damian who turned him in

879
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,810
<35-15,CASTLE>告发他行窃的
<35-15,CASTLE>to the headmaster for stealing.

880
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,140
<35-15,CASTLE>但他们有相同的社交圈子
<35-15,CASTLE>But they did run in some of the same circles,

881
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,890
<35-15,CASTLE>偶尔会在派对上遇见
<35-15,CASTLE>sometimes went to the same parties.

882
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,360
<35-15,CASTLE>要是迈克尔·鲁瑟福听说了
<35-15,CASTLE>What if Michael Rutherford heard

883
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,590
<35-15,CASTLE>韦斯莱在波多黎各的度假屋
<35-15,CASTLE>about the Westlake vacation home in Puerto Rico?

<35-15,CASTLE>几乎长年空置  里面尽是财宝
<35-15,CASTLE>It was nearly always vacant, full of treasure.

885
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,920
<35-15,CASTLE>他可以小赚一笔
<35-15,CASTLE>He could've made a small fortune

886
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,650
<35-15,CASTLE>同时向戴米安复仇
<35-15,CASTLE>and gotten revenge on Damian at the same time.

<36-2,BECKETT>Damian Westlake is a thief and a cheater...

889
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,860
<36-2,BECKETT>但他或许不是我们要找的杀手
<36-2,BECKETT>but he might not be our killer.

890
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,020
<36-2,BECKETT>伙计们  我不想承认
<36-2,BECKETT>You guys, I hate admitting it,

891
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,660
<36-3,RYAN>但卡塞尔或许是对的
<36-3,RYAN>but Castle might be right.

892
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,930
<36-3,RYAN>我们也觉得卡塞尔是对的
<36-3,RYAN>We've also been thinking that Castle might be right.

950
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,230
<41-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>并不是正式的
<41-4,SIMON CAMPBELL>Well, it's very casual.

951
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,560
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>我们是老朋友了
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>Well, for a long time, we were just friends.

952
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,420
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>我是他离婚时的精神支柱
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>I was a shoulder to cry on after the divorce.

953
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,290
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>直到最近我们才  呃
<41-5,AMBER PATINELLI>It's been only been recently that, uh...

954
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,590
<41-6,BECKETT>-情人节有什么计划  -没啥特别的
<41-6,BECKETT>- Any plans for valentine's day? - Uh, nothing special, no.

955
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,590
<41-8,CASTLE>你希望和薇琪一起过  对吧
<41-8,CASTLE>You were hoping to spend it with Vicky, right?

956
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,000
<41-9,AMBER PATINELLI>什么意思
<41-9,AMBER PATINELLI>What does that mean?

957
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,120
<41-9,AMBER PATINELLI>西蒙
<41-9,AMBER PATINELLI>Simon?

<41-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>薇琪和我交谈过  仅此而已

959
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,150
<41-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>这有什么关联吗  探长
<41-10,SIMON CAMPBELL>How is this relevant to anything, detective?

960
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,840
<41-11,BECKETT>薇琪知道你和安珀在一起吗
<41-11,BECKETT>Did Vicky know about you and Amber?

961
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,780
<41-12,SIMON CAMPBELL>不  我不想让她知道
<41-12,SIMON CAMPBELL>No. I didn't want her to know.

962
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,520
<41-13,CASTLE>那么有可能薇琪向安珀倾诉
<41-13,CASTLE>So it's possible that Vicky innocently confided

963
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,700
<41-13,CASTLE>告诉她  自己要离开戴米安
<41-13,CASTLE>in her friend Amber, telling her she was leaving Damian,

964
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,390
<41-13,CASTLE>回到西蒙 身边
<41-13,CASTLE>going back to Simon,

965
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,040
<41-13,CASTLE>但并不知道你们有一腿
<41-13,CASTLE>not knowing that he was your Simon now.

966
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,780
<41-14,BECKETT>安珀你在星期三下午四点十五分
<41-14,BECKETT>Amber, you called for a company car at 4:15

967
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,400
<41-14,BECKETT>叫了计程车
<41-14,BECKETT>On Wednesday afternoon.

968
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,910
<41-14,BECKETT>我跟刚跟调度员谈过了
<41-14,BECKETT>We just talked to the dispatcher.

969
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,390
<41-14,BECKETT>他说你雇了一个小时的轿车
<41-14,BECKETT>He says you ordered a sedan and kept it for an hour,

970
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,610
<41-14,BECKETT>往返韦斯莱家
<41-14,BECKETT>a round-trip to the Westlakes' and back.

971
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,870
<41-14,BECKETT>我们在钉枪上
<41-14,BECKETT>We found a nail gun

972
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,530
<41-14,BECKETT>找到了无法辨认的指纹
<41-14,BECKETT>with fingerprints that we couldn't identify.

973
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,120
<41-14,BECKETT>如果跟你的对比一下
<41-14,BECKETT>If we compare them to yours,

974
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,770
<41-14,BECKETT>你说会吻合吗
<41-14,BECKETT>do you think we'd find a match?

975
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,900
<41-14,BECKETT>你不是要去杀她的  是吧
<41-14,BECKETT>You didn't go there intending to kill her, did you?

976
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,120
<41-14,BECKETT>不
<41-14,BECKETT>No.

977
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,770
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>我只是想聊聊
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>I just wanted to talk.

978
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,360
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>她可以找任何男人
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>She could have any man she wanted.

979
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,460
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>我求她把你让给我
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>And I begged her to let me have you.

980
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,920
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>她说不
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>She said no.

981
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,080
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>我太爱你了
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>I love you so much.

982
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,550
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>她永远不可能像我那样爱你
<41-15,AMBER PATINELLI>She could never love you the way that I do.

983
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:42,720
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>那么你是说
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>So you're saying that

984
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,030
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>安珀根本不知道我的过去
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>Amber didn't even know about my past?

985
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,370
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>并不是要陷害我  只是个怪异的巧合
<42-1,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>It wasn't a frame, just a strange coincidence?

986
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,520
<42-2,CASTLE>或是天意
<42-2,CASTLE>Or kismet.

987
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,600
<42-2,CASTLE>你要去哪里

00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,550
<42-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>我不明白
<42-7,DAMIAN WESTLAKE>I don't understand.

999
