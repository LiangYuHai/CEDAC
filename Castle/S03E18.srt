1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,670
<1-1,MANDY BRONSON>乔瑟夫  这是我们最后一次这样做了
<1-1,MANDY BRONSON>Joseph... this is the last time we can do this.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,470
<1-3,MANDY BRONSON>-你说什么呢  -我要回到我丈夫身边
<1-3,MANDY BRONSON>- What are you talking about? - I'm going back to my husband.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,530
<1-5,MANDY BRONSON>-你是说阿方索  -对不起
<1-5,MANDY BRONSON>- Alfonso? - I'm sorry.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,730
<1-6,LANCE HASTINGS>安琪亲爱的  那我们怎么办
<1-6,LANCE HASTINGS>Angie, baby, what about us?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,790
<1-7,MANDY BRONSON>上帝啊  天啊  他回来了
<1-7,MANDY BRONSON>Oh, my god. Oh, my god. That's him.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,930
<1-8,ALFONSO>-他提前回来了  -安琪拉  你在楼上吗
<1-8,ALFONSO>- He's home early. - Angela, are you upstairs.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,510
<1-9,MANDY BRONSON>去衣橱
<1-9,MANDY BRONSON>The closet.

8
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,690
<1-9,MANDY BRONSON>我的甜心
<1-9,MANDY BRONSON>Mi bello!

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,450
<1-10,LANCE HASTINGS>好吧  这是怎么个情况
<1-10,LANCE HASTINGS>All right, what's going on up there, fellas?

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,850
<1-10,LANCE HASTINGS>这个玩笑开得有点低劣了吧
<1-10,LANCE HASTINGS>The gag getting a little thin?

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,790
<1-11,CREWMAN>我的天啊
<1-11,CREWMAN>Oh, my god.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,440
<1-12,LANCE HASTINGS>是莎拉
<1-12,LANCE HASTINGS>It's Sarah.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,900
<1-12,LANCE HASTINGS>有人杀了莎拉
<1-12,LANCE HASTINGS>They killed Sarah.

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,510
<2-1,CASTLE>我知道你不是在做早饭  那么
<2-1,CASTLE>I know you aren't cooking breakfast, so...

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,060
<2-1,CASTLE>那么你这是在做什么
<2-1,CASTLE>so what is all this?

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,250
<2-2,MARTHA>春季大扫除
<2-2,MARTHA>Spring cleaning.

17
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,380
<2-3,CASTLE>母亲大人  这让我很吃惊啊
<2-3,CASTLE>Mother, I am, I am shocked

18
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,960
<2-3,CASTLE>你居然知道怎么用海绵块
<2-3,CASTLE>that you even know how to operate a sponge.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,270
<2-4,MARTHA>喂  我以前大扫除过
<2-4,MARTHA>Oh, I have cleaned before.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,130
<2-4,MARTHA>好吧  我监督别人大扫除过
<2-4,MARTHA>Well, I've supervised cleaning before.

21
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,130
<2-5,CASTLE>是什么导致你兴致大发做家务啊
<2-5,CASTLE>And what has prompted, this sudden burst of domestic devotion?

22
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,830
<2-6,MARTHA>我表演学校上课那个地儿
<2-6,MARTHA>The space for my acting school

23
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,230
<2-6,MARTHA>到下个月也准备不好
<2-6,MARTHA>won't be ready for another month,

24
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,170
<2-6,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯忙着准备她的进阶考试
<2-6,MARTHA>Alexis is all busy with her A.P.tests,

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,780
<2-6,MARTHA>我的午餐约会也取消了
<2-6,MARTHA>my lunch date canceled...

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,130
<2-8,MARTHA>如果我不让自己忙起来  我的头发
<2-8,MARTHA>And if I don't do something productive,

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,870
<2-8,MARTHA>-都会被我揪光  所以你给我边去  -抱歉
<2-8,MARTHA>- I'm gonna tear my hair out, so out my way. - Pardon.

28
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,460
<2-10,CASTLE>说到头发
<2-10,CASTLE>Speaking of hair.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,330
<2-10,CASTLE>你好啊  贝克特
<2-10,CASTLE>Hello, Beckett.

30
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,800
<2-11,MARTHA>是的  第21街1777号
<2-11,MARTHA>Yes. 1777 21st Street.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,390
<2-10,CASTLE>好  到那见
<2-10,CASTLE>All right. I'll meet you there.

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,970
<2-11,MARTHA>你刚才是说第21街1777号吗
<2-11,MARTHA>Did you say 1777 21st Street?

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,450
<2-12,CASTLE>对啊  那发生了一起谋杀案  怎么了
<2-12,CASTLE>Yeah. There was a murder there. Why?

34
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,750
<2-13,MARTHA>我知道那个地址  那里是吉星摄影棚
<2-13,MARTHA>Oh, I know that address. That's Gemstar studios.

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,390
<2-13,MARTHA>那是拍摄《诱惑巷》的地方
<2-13,MARTHA>That's where they film "Temptation Lane."

36
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,740
<2-14,CASTLE>是那部你曾经演过的肥皂剧吧
<2-14,CASTLE>The soap opera you used to be on?

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,990
<2-15,MARTHA>真希望遇害的不是我认识的人
<2-15,MARTHA>Oh, I-I hope it's nobody that I know.

38
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,390
<2-15,MARTHA>也许我该和你一起去
<2-15,MARTHA>Maybe I should go with you.

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,870
<2-16,CASTLE>那可是犯罪现场  老妈
<2-16,CASTLE>It's a crime scene, mother.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,220
<2-16,CASTLE>我们是受过训练的专业人士
<2-16,CASTLE>We're trained professionals.

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,000
<2-17,MARTHA>理查德·卡塞尔  你既没接受过训练
<2-17,MARTHA>Richard Castle, you are neither trained

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,620
<2-17,MARTHA>也不是专业人士
<2-17,MARTHA>nor a professional.

43
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,680
<2-18,CASTLE>我发短信跟你汇报进展
<2-18,CASTLE>I'll text you with updates.

44
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,390
<3-1,ESPOSITO>被害人叫做莎拉·卡特勒
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Victim's name is Sarah Cutler.

45
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,550
<3-1,ESPOSITO>看上去她应该是昨晚遇害
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Looks like she was killed last night

46
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,350
<3-1,ESPOSITO>并被塞进了柜子里
<3-1,ESPOSITO>and stuffed into a closet on set.

47
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,650
<3-2,BECKETT>-她参与剧集制作吗  -是的
<3-2,BECKETT>- Was she a part of the production? - Yeah.

48
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,810
<3-4,CASTLE>我来猜猜  是大家都很讨厌的跋扈女主角
<3-4,CASTLE>Let me guess. The diva actress that everyone hated.

49
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,340
<3-5,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  实际上她是个编剧
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Actually, Castle, she was a writer.

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,940
<3-6,CASTLE>-编剧  -对
<3-6,CASTLE>- A writer? - Mm-hmm.

52
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,200
<3-8,CASTLE>-为什么会有人想要谋杀编剧  -原因多了去了
<3-8,CASTLE>- Why would anyone want to kill a writer? - Oh, so many reasons.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,040
<3-9,BECKETT>也许是莎拉发现
<3-9,BECKETT>Or maybe Sarah discovered

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,740
<3-10,CASTLE>希腊亿万富翁米克斯发明了
<3-10,CASTLE>that Greek billionaire Mikkos had invented a machine

55
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,170
<3-10,CASTLE>可以制造暴风雪的机器
<3-10,CASTLE>that could cause blizzards,

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,400
<3-10,CASTLE>而这机器会将整个世界带入冰河世纪
<3-10,CASTLE>that would plunge the entire world into an ice age.

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,870
<3-11,BECKETT>不是吧  你的推断是邪恶的造雪机器
<3-11,BECKETT>Really? You're gonna go with an evil weather machine?

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,510
<3-12,CASTLE>发生过啊
<3-12,CASTLE>It already happened.

60
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,790
<3-12,CASTLE>在《综合医院》里就有过  你们记住
<3-12,CASTLE>On "General Hospital." Look, bear in mind,

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,980
<3-13,BECKETT>我们要进入一个充满戏剧冲突的世界
<3-13,BECKETT>we're entering into a world of epic drama

62
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,880
<3-12,CASTLE>里面的角色个个都是生动而夸张
<3-12,CASTLE>with larger-than-life characters,

63
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,710
<3-12,CASTLE>他们每个人都有着扭曲的秘密
<3-12,CASTLE>each one teeming with twisted secrets

64
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,010
<3-12,CASTLE>和个人阴谋
<3-12,CASTLE>and personal intrigue.

65
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,640
<3-12,CASTLE>也就是说这起谋杀案的动机
<3-12,CASTLE>It stands to reason that the motive for this murder

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,250
<3-12,CASTLE>能写部肥皂剧也是合乎情理的
<3-12,CASTLE>will be worthy of a soap opera.

67
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,520
<3-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  就算是在充满戏剧冲突的世界
<3-13,BECKETT>Castle, even in a world of epic drama,

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,740
<3-13,BECKETT>杀人动机也都很平常的
<3-13,BECKETT>the motives are usually quite ordinary.

69
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,720
<3-14,CASTLE>那对你来说很平常吗
<3-14,CASTLE>Now does that look ordinary to you?

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,780
<3-14,CASTLE>被害人背后插着一把斧子
<3-14,CASTLE>The victim with an ax in her back

71
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,170
<3-14,CASTLE>死在了她自己剧集的拍摄现场
<3-14,CASTLE>on the set of her own show...

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,100
<3-14,CASTLE>很有可能  凶手就在摄影棚内
<3-14,CASTLE>Odds are, the killer walks amongst us

73
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,830
<3-14,CASTLE>混迹于人群之中
<3-14,CASTLE>on this very soundstage.

74
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,310
<3-15,BECKETT>有什么发现吗
<3-15,BECKETT>So what have we got?

75
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,680
<3-16,LANIE>她的脊柱被斧头严重砍伤
<3-16,LANIE>Her spinal cord was severed with the ax.

76
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,050
<3-16,LANIE>而她的肺部也因此充满了血液
<3-16,LANIE>Upon contact, her lungs filled with blood,

77
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,440
<3-16,LANIE>导致她溺水身亡
<3-16,LANIE>'causing her to drown.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,900
<3-16,LANIE>我能把死亡时间推算在4小时区间内
<3-16,LANIE>I can put the time of death in a 4-hour window,

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,910
<3-16,LANIE>大概在昨晚7点到11点之间
<3-16,LANIE>somewhere between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. last night.

80
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,750
<3-17,BECKETT>那斧子又是哪里来的
<3-17,BECKETT>And where did this ax come from?

81
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,130
<3-18,ESPOSITO>是舞台上的消防斧
<3-18,ESPOSITO>It's the fire ax from the stage.

82
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,430
<3-18,ESPOSITO>剧组的人认为那斧头也许有象征意义
<3-18,ESPOSITO>Crew members think it might be symbolic.

83
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,030
<3-19,CASTLE>象征意义
<3-19,CASTLE>Symbolic?

84
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,120
<3-20,ESPOSITO>当卡特勒小姐接任该剧编剧之后
<3-20,ESPOSITO>Well, when Ms. Cutler took over writing the show,

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,330
<3-20,ESPOSITO>她做的第一件事就是大刀阔斧地
<3-20,ESPOSITO>first thing she did was kill off

86
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,280
<3-20,ESPOSITO>砍去了该剧的一个主要角色
<3-20,ESPOSITO>one of the main characters with an ax.

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,550
<3-20,ESPOSITO>虽然此举拯救了剧集  但有些粉丝不太开心
<3-20,ESPOSITO>Now it saved the show, but some of the fans were unhappy.

88
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,630
<3-21,LANIE>你说得太对了  我是大大的不开心
<3-21,LANIE>You damn right we were unhappy.

89
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,890
<3-21,LANIE>阿什莉·康拉德作为《诱惑巷》的女族长
<3-21,LANIE>Ashley Conrad was the matriarch of "Temptation Lane"

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,170
<3-21,LANIE>整整三十年  结果突然就被砍掉了
<3-21,LANIE>for 30 years, and then all of a sudden--whap!

91
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,230
<3-22,BECKETT>蕾妮
<3-22,BECKETT>Lanie.

92
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,230
<3-22,BECKETT>好吧
<3-22,BECKETT>Right.

93
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,870
<3-23,LANIE>根据鉴证组的取证结果  她就是在这里被杀的
<3-23,LANIE>Based on the C.S.U. sweep, she was killed right here.

94
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,660
<3-23,LANIE>凶手把血迹擦掉
<3-23,LANIE>The killer wiped up the blood spatter

95
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,270
<3-23,LANIE>然后把她塞进了柜子里
<3-23,LANIE>and shoved her in the closet.

96
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,580
<3-24,CASTLE>也就是说凶手知道这里有一个
<3-24,CASTLE>Which means they knew there was a closet

97
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,470
<3-24,CASTLE>可以藏尸的柜子
<3-24,CASTLE>to shove her into,

98
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,170
<3-24,CASTLE>表明凶手对这里的布局很熟悉
<3-24,CASTLE>suggesting someone familiar with the layout.

99
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,190
<3-25,RYAN>-也许是内部人作案  -我刚跟保安核实过
<3-25,RYAN>- An insider, perhaps? - Well, I just checked with security.

100
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,090
<3-25,RYAN>他们现在处于高度警戒状态  但你也能看出来
<3-25,RYAN>They're on high alert now, but as you can tell,

101
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,830
<3-25,RYAN>警不警戒都差不多
<3-25,RYAN>things aren't exactly buttoned up around here.

102
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,970
<3-26,BECKETT>那监视录像呢
<3-26,BECKETT>And what about the cameras?

103
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,280
<3-27,RYAN>只在正门处有一个摄像头
<3-27,RYAN>Only one at the main entrance,

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,480
<3-27,RYAN>但是这个摄影棚的入口没有门卫
<3-27,RYAN>but no one was manning the entrance to this soundstage.

105
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,590
<3-28,BECKETT>所以说有可能是外人混了进来
<3-28,BECKETT>Oh, so it is possible that someone from the outside got in?

106
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,220
<3-28,BECKETT>和死者亲属联系上了吗
<3-28,BECKETT>Have you talked to next of kin?

<5-10,VINCE POWERS>and Sarah had to make a lot of tough decisions,

162
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,380

176

<5-18,BECKETT>这里指代的是乔瑟夫·福克斯和安琪拉·坎农
<5-18,BECKETT>In this case, it would be Joseph Fox and Angela Cannon,

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,620
<5-18,BECKETT>所以才叫福坎
<5-18,BECKETT>hence FoxCan.

178
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,550
<5-19,VINCE POWERS>完全正确  但当她来这儿之后  情绪完全失控

<6-2,BECKETT>每个人表达自己的悲愤的方式都有所不同
<6-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, everybody processes their grief differently.

<6-4,BECKETT>在现实世界中太扯了
<6-4,BECKETT>Not in the real world.

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,750
<9-19,ESPOSITO>-没什么  -没什么
<9-19,ESPOSITO>- Nothing. - Nothing.

315
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,350
<9-20,ESPOSITO>玛丽和丹尼斯证实
<9-20,ESPOSITO>Mary and Dennis confirm

316
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,990
<9-20,ESPOSITO>那个博客小妞整晚都呆在自己的房间里
<9-20,ESPOSITO>that blogger chick was in her room all night.

317
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,150
<9-21,CASTLE>演员和剧组人员那边有什么情况
<9-21,CASTLE>What about the cast and crew?

318
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,840
<9-22,ESPOSITO>目前为止  他们的不在场证明都是成立的
<9-22,ESPOSITO>So far, all their alibis checked out.

319
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,520
<9-22,ESPOSITO>但我在仔细调查莎拉的日程表时
<9-22,ESPOSITO>But I was looking over Sarah's schedule.

320
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,790
<9-22,ESPOSITO>发现上周有几个约会
<9-22,ESPOSITO>Last week, there were a couple of appointments

321
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,880
<9-22,ESPOSITO>只标注了M
<9-22,ESPOSITO>that just say "M",

322
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,520
<9-22,ESPOSITO>谋杀前一天有一次
<9-22,ESPOSITO>and there was another one the day before the murder,

323
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,730
<9-22,ESPOSITO>明天还跟M有约
<9-22,ESPOSITO>then one scheduled for tomorrow.

324
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,480
<9-24,ESPOSITO>-那又如何  -这不是她的助手安排的约会
<9-24,ESPOSITO>- So? - So her assistant didn't schedule these,

325
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,840
<9-24,ESPOSITO>也就是说是私事
<9-24,ESPOSITO>which means it was personal,

326
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,320
<9-24,ESPOSITO>而且她的丈夫
<9-24,ESPOSITO>and her husband didn't

327
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,410
<9-24,ESPOSITO>-也不知道这些约会  -鉴于莎拉工作那么忙
<9-24,ESPOSITO>- know about them either. - With Sarah's workload,

328
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,980
<9-25,CASTLE>还要挤出时间  说明这是很重要的约会
<9-25,CASTLE>it must have been important for her to make time.

329
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,100
<9-26,ESPOSITO>没错  而且她的丈夫和助手都说
<9-26,ESPOSITO>Exactly, and her husband and assistant both say that

330
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,460
<9-26,ESPOSITO>她每次赴约回来后  心情都十分沮丧
<9-26,ESPOSITO>when she came back from these appointments, she was upset.

331
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,110
<9-27,BECKETT>那好  看看我们能从这里找到什么线索
<9-27,BECKETT>All right, let's see what we can dig up from that.

332
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,210
<9-29,BECKETT>-贝克特  -你在公寓里发现什么没
<9-29,BECKETT>- Hey, Beckett. - Hey. What'd you find at the apartment?

333
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,630
<9-30,RYAN>她丈夫的东西
<9-30,RYAN>Her husband's stuff.

334
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,490
<9-30,RYAN>他的衣服全不见了  浴室也只有她的东西
<9-30,RYAN>His clothes are gone, and only her stuff is in the bathroom,

335
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,250
<9-30,RYAN>我和看门人谈过  他说
<9-30,RYAN>so I talked to the doorman, and he said

336
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,650
<9-30,RYAN>文斯将近两个多月没住在那儿了
<9-30,RYAN>That Vince hasn't lived there in almost two months.

337
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,790
<9-30,RYAN>他们分居了
<9-30,RYAN>They've been separated.

338
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,710
<9-31,BECKETT>有意思  他之前可没提这回事
<9-31,BECKETT>Funny he didn't mention that earlier.

339
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,520
<9-31,BECKETT>看来有人在《诱惑巷》藏了什么东西
<9-31,BECKETT>Looks like someone's hiding something on "Temptation Lane."

340
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,090
<10-1,VINCENT POWERS>我知道如果告诉你们我的婚姻出现了问题
<10-1,VINCENT POWERS>Look, I knew if I told you that my marriage was in trouble

341
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,120
<10-1,VINCENT POWERS>我就会成为头号嫌疑人
<10-1,VINCENT POWERS>that I would be suspect number one.

342
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,110
<10-2,BECKETT>也许  但现在我们知道你撒了谎
<10-2,BECKETT>Maybe, but now that we know that you lied,

343
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,150
<10-2,BECKETT>你就更可疑了
<10-2,BECKETT>it makes you look even worse.

344
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,120
<10-3,CASTLE>你们为什么分居
<10-3,CASTLE>Why did you separate?

345
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,930
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>自从莎拉成了首席编剧  一切都变了
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>Everything changed after Sarah got the big promotion.

346
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,160
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>我想和自己的妻子待一会儿
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>If I wanted to spend time with my own wife,

347
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,260
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>还得先预约
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>I had to schedule an appointment.

348
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,210
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>我受不了  所以我就搬出去了
<10-4,VINCENT POWERS>It wasn't working, so I moved out.

349
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,870
<10-5,BECKETT>这个故事还有另一个版本
<10-5,BECKETT>You know, there's another version of this story

350
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,240
<10-5,BECKETT>那就是你妻子把你赶出家门  并要求离婚
<10-5,BECKETT>where your wife kicked you out, and then she demanded a divorce.

351
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,870
<10-6,CASTLE>把她杀死你就不必担心
<10-6,CASTLE>Hmm. Only this way, you don't have to worry

352
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,890
<10-7,VINCENT POWERS>-她会分你的财产了  -我没杀我妻子
<10-7,VINCENT POWERS>- about splitting your assets.  - I didn't kill my wife.

353
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,340
<10-8,BECKETT>那她被害那晚你到底在哪儿
<10-8,BECKETT>Well, then where were you the night that she was killed?

354
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,380
<10-9,VINCENT POWERS>我在旅馆
<10-9,VINCENT POWERS>I was at the hotel.

355
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,490
<10-9,VINCENT POWERS>这里收工  我就去了旅馆
<10-9,VINCENT POWERS>I went there immediately after we rapped here.

356
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,430
<10-10,BECKETT>有人能证明吗
<10-10,BECKETT>And can anyone vouch for that?

357
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,240
<10-11,CASTLE>快说吧  文斯
<10-11,CASTLE>Come on, Vince.

358
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,590
<10-11,CASTLE>说你是一个人
<10-11,CASTLE>Tell us you were alone.

359
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,470
<10-11,CASTLE>这样我们逮捕你也省点儿事
<10-11,CASTLE>It'll make arresting you that much easier.

360
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,050
<10-12,VINCENT POWERS>我
<10-12,VINCENT POWERS>I, um...

361
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,700
<10-12,VINCENT POWERS>我不是  独自一人
<10-12,VINCENT POWERS>I wasn't... alone.

362
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,630
<10-13,BECKETT>另一个人是谁
<10-13,BECKETT>I'm gonna need a name.

363
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,510
<10-14,VINCENT POWERS>曼迪·布朗森
<10-14,VINCENT POWERS>Mandy Bronson.

364
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,110
<10-14,VINCENT POWERS>曼迪·布朗森
<10-14,VINCENT POWERS>Mandy Bronson?

365
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,320
<10-15,CASTLE>饰演《欲望巷》里的安琪拉·坎农那个吗
<10-15,CASTLE>As in Angela Cannon, as in star of "Temptation lane"?

366
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,920
<10-16,VINCENT POWERS>是的  就是那个曼迪·布朗森
<10-16,VINCENT POWERS>Yes, that Mandy Bronson.

367
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,030
<10-17,CASTLE>我就随口问问
<10-17,CASTLE>Just checking.

368
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,250
<10-18,BECKETT>她在那儿过夜了吗
<10-18,BECKETT>Did she stay the night?

369
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,060
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>没有  我们定了客房服务  然后
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>No. We ordered room service, and, um...

370
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,620
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>大概7点钟  她收到莎拉的邮件
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>About 7:00, she got an e-mail from Sarah

371
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,750
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>然后就走了
<10-19,VINCENT POWERS>and she went running off.

372
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,670
<10-20,BECKETT>也就是说你妻子被杀害的那晚
<10-20,BECKETT>So the night that your wife was killed,

373
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,040
<10-20,BECKETT>她发过邮件给你的情人
<10-20,BECKETT>she e-mailed your mistress,

374
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,170
<10-20,BECKETT>你觉得这不值一提吗
<10-20,BECKETT>and you didn't think that that was important to mention?

375
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,600
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>这又不是什么大事
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>It wasn't a big deal.

376
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,660
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>我问过曼迪了  她说有些新剧本
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>I asked Mandy about it. She got some new script pages

377
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,310
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>莎拉想让她熟悉一下
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>that Sarah wanted her to look over,

378
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,210
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>于是她就回家去记台词了
<10-21,VINCENT POWERS>so she went home to memorize them.

379
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,530
<10-22,BECKETT>后半夜你是一个人吗
<10-22,BECKETT>Were you alone the rest of the night?

380
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,250
<10-23,VINCENT POWERS>是  是的  我打开小冰箱
<10-23,VINCENT POWERS>Yes. Yes. I cracked the minibar,

381
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,270
<10-23,VINCENT POWERS>看了付费电视  你可以去查
<10-23,VINCENT POWERS>I ordered pay-per-view. You can check.

382
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,680
<10-24,BECKETT>我会的
<10-24,BECKETT>I will.

383
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,160
<11-1,CASTLE>-不可能是她老公  -但他有动机
<11-1,CASTLE>- It can't be the husband.  - Well, he's got motive.

384
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,630
<11-3,CASTLE>不错  但婚姻都不保了  为了谋财吗
<11-3,CASTLE>Yeah, but marriage on the rocks, killing for money?

385
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,370
<11-3,CASTLE>-这也太  -常见了
<11-3,CASTLE>- That's just so--  - Ordinary.

386
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,700
<11-4,BECKETT>我们应该注意的是曼迪·布朗森
<11-4,BECKETT>We need to focus on Mandy Bronson--

387
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,170
<11-5,CASTLE>跟死者丈夫干柴烈火  导致别人婚姻
<11-5,CASTLE>Home-wrecking diva engaged in a torrid affair

388
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,690
<11-5,CASTLE>不和睦的跋扈女主角
<11-5,CASTLE>with the victim's husband.

389
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,400
<11-5,CASTLE>在莎拉被害的当天傍晚
<11-5,CASTLE>She fled their illicit love nest

390
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,860
<11-5,CASTLE>安琪拉在收到神秘邮件之后
<11-5,CASTLE>after a mysterious e-mail from Sarah

391
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,530
<11-5,CASTLE>逃离了他们偷情的爱巢
<11-5,CASTLE>on the eve of her murder.

392
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,590
<11-6,BECKETT>是啊  但我们还不知道是否有那封邮件
<11-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but we don't even know if there was an e-mail.

393
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,700
<11-6,BECKETT>我是说文森特有可能在撒谎  不过你说得对
<11-6,BECKETT>I mean, Vincent could've been lying. But you are right.

394
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,750
<11-6,BECKETT>曼迪·布朗森确实需要解释一下
<11-6,BECKETT>Mandy Bronson does have some explaining to do.

395
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,270
<11-7,CASTLE>-埃斯蕾妮  -什么
<11-7,CASTLE>- "Esplanie."  - What?

396
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,170
<11-8,BECKETT>蕾妮和埃斯波西托啊  就像福坎
<11-8,BECKETT>Lanie and Esposito. Like FoxCan.

397
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,730
<11-9,CASTLE>我们可以叫他们埃斯蕾妮  不是很妙吗
<11-9,CASTLE>We can call them Esplanie, which is perfect

399
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,070
<11-9,CASTLE>因为他们老是在做"解释"
<11-9,CASTLE>because they're always esplaining things.

400
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,140

<11-12,CASTLE>- What are you doing here?  - Grieving.

404

<11-14,CASTLE>你都不认识被害人
<11-14,CASTLE>You didn't even know the victim.

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,540
<11-15,MARTHA>亲爱的  这样的一部剧痛失编剧

<11-18,MARTHA>她被绑架  活埋
<11-18,MARTHA>she was kidnapped, buried alive,

417
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,440
<11-18,MARTHA>和熊一起困在山洞里  再被绑架
<11-18,MARTHA>trapped in a cave with bears, kidnapped again,

418
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,270
<11-18,MARTHA>然后被劫持  关在巴黎的下水道
<11-18,MARTHA>and held hostage in the sewers of Paris.

419
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,100
<11-19,BECKETT>-你演了多久啊  -三个星期
<11-19,BECKETT>- How long were you on the show?  - Three weeks.

420
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,760
<11-20,MARTHA>我得走了  失陪
<11-20,MARTHA>Gotta go. Excuse me.

421
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,700
<11-21,CASTLE>我妈真是给"显而易见"一词做了新的诠释啊
<11-21,CASTLE>My mother gives new meaning to the word "transparent."

422
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,490
<12-1,REESE HARMON>这是她的邮箱  你们想找什么
<12-1,REESE HARMON>There's her account. What are you looking for?

423
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,370
<12-2,BECKETT>莎拉死之前发的一封邮件
<12-2,BECKETT>An e-mail that Sarah sent before she died.

424
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,630
<12-3,CASTLE>这个
<12-3,CASTLE>There it is.

425
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,220
<12-4,BECKETT>"马上来办公室见我"
<12-4,BECKETT>"Meet me at the office asap."

426
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,600
<12-4,BECKETT>那晚莎拉让曼迪到这里来见她
<12-4,BECKETT>So Sarah had Mandy meet her here that night.

427
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
<12-5,CASTLE>你认为是她发现了他们的奸情
<12-5,CASTLE>You think she found out about the affair,

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,670
<12-5,CASTLE>打算和她对质吗
<12-5,CASTLE>planned to confront her?

429
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,540
<12-6,BECKETT>我不知道  有附件
<12-6,BECKETT>I don't know. There's an attachment.

430
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,940
<12-7,CASTLE>是下一集的剧本
<12-7,CASTLE>Oh, it's a script for an upcoming episode.

431
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,870
<12-8,BECKETT>角色们在潘普洛纳[西班牙城市]度假
<12-8,BECKETT>The characters are vacationing in Pamplona.

432
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,230
<12-8,BECKETT>-天呐  -我的天啊
<12-8,BECKETT>- Oh, my god.  - Oh, my god.

433
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,240
<12-9,CASTLE>曼迪·布朗森的角色在跟公牛奔跑时
<12-9,CASTLE>Mandy Bronson's character is gored to death

434
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,300
<12-9,CASTLE>被戳死了
<12-9,CASTLE>while running with the bulls.

435
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,270
<12-10,BECKETT>莎拉叫曼迪来
<12-10,BECKETT>Sarah brought her here

436
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,570
<12-10,BECKETT>是想告诉她  她被写死了
<12-10,BECKETT>to tell Mandy she was writing her off the show.

437
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,550
<12-11,CASTLE>看来是曼迪先把她给解决了
<12-11,CASTLE>Looks like Mandy wrote her off first.

438
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,360
<12-11,CASTLE>卡塞尔  过来  过来
<12-11,CASTLE>Castle. Come here. Come here. Come here.

439
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,100
<13-1,ESPOSITO>我知道她是谋杀案疑犯
<13-1,ESPOSITO>I know she's a murder suspect,

440
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,450
<13-1,ESPOSITO>但必须承认  她太火辣了
<13-1,ESPOSITO>but you gotta admit, she is smokin' hot.

441
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,240
<13-2,CASTLE>同意  正点到死者的导演丈夫
<13-2,CASTLE>Agreed. So hot, in fact, it led to a torrid affair

442
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
<13-2,CASTLE>跟她偷情
<13-2,CASTLE>with Sarah's director husband.

443
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,030
<13-2,CASTLE>莎拉发现了
<13-2,CASTLE>Sarah found out about it,

444
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,950
<13-2,CASTLE>打算把曼迪的角色写死
<13-2,CASTLE>decided to kill off Mandy's character.

445
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,590
<13-2,CASTLE>没有比这更肥皂的剧情了
<13-2,CASTLE>Doesn't get any soapier than that.

447
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,110
<13-3,ESPOSITO>很显然你没看过《娇小玲珑》
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Well, obviously you haven't seen Chiquitas.

448
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,330
<13-4,CASTLE>-香蕉吗  -不是  西班牙语肥皂剧
<13-4,CASTLE>- As in bananas? - No, as in the telenovela.

449
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,560
<13-5,ESPOSITO>小时候和外婆总是一起看那部剧
<13-5,ESPOSITO>I used to watch it growing up with my grandmother.

450
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,510
<13-5,ESPOSITO>兄弟  其中有一集加布里埃拉发现
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Bro, there was this one episode where Gabriela discovered that

451
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,160
<13-5,ESPOSITO>她丈夫和她那邪恶的胞妹特雷西塔上床
<13-5,ESPOSITO>her husband was sleeping with her evil twin sister Teresita,

452
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,220
<13-5,ESPOSITO>结果后来才发现
<13-5,ESPOSITO>only to later find out that she had

453
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,070
<13-5,ESPOSITO>她有多重人格分裂症
<13-5,ESPOSITO>multiple personality disorder.

454
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,050
<13-6,CASTLE>等等  那能算是出轨吗
<13-6,CASTLE>Wait. Does that even qualify as cheating?

455
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,380
<13-8,BECKETT>-老兄  -怎么了
<13-8,BECKETT>- Dude.  - What?

456
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,880
<13-9,ESPOSITO>别瞎分析
<13-9,ESPOSITO>Don't overthink it.

457
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,680
<13-10,BECKETT>布朗森小姐  我很好奇
<13-10,BECKETT>Ms. Bronson, I'm curious how you felt

458
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,930
<13-10,BECKETT>当你发现
<13-10,BECKETT>when you found out

459
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,880
<13-10,BECKETT>莎拉要把你的角色写死时你是什么感觉
<13-10,BECKETT>that Sarah was gonna kill off your character.

460
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,740
<13-11,MANDY BRONSON>杀了我的角色  太可笑了
<13-11,MANDY BRONSON>Kill off my character? That's ridiculous.

461
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,630
<13-11,MANDY BRONSON>收视率提升都是因为我
<13-11,MANDY BRONSON>I'm the reason the ratings were up.

462
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,290
<13-12,BECKETT>那她为什么要写
<13-12,BECKETT>Well, then why did she write this scene

463
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,350
<13-12,BECKETT>安琪拉·坎农不幸被公牛戳死这一幕呢
<13-12,BECKETT>where Angela Cannon has an unfortunate encounter with a bull?

464
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,640
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>莎拉可能给这个剧的每一个角色
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>Sarah probably writes a death scene

465
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,380
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>都写好了一个死亡场景
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>for every character on the show...

466
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,500
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>为了让演员不要太嚣张
<13-13,MANDY BRONSON>to keep the actors in line.

467
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,120
<13-14,BECKETT>她在自己被害那晚才写了那些剧本
<13-14,BECKETT>She wrote those particular pages the night that she was murdered

468
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,930
<13-14,BECKETT>而当时你和她丈夫在一起
<13-14,BECKETT>while you were with her husband.

469
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,030
<13-14,BECKETT>他说你一收到
<13-14,BECKETT>He told us that you left

470
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,390
<13-14,BECKETT>莎拉发来的邮件就走了
<13-14,BECKETT>right after you got an e-mail from Sarah.

471
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,710
<13-14,BECKETT>但你没回家  是吧
<13-14,BECKETT>But you didn't go home, did you?

472
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,070
<13-14,BECKETT>你去和她对质了
<13-14,BECKETT>You went to go and confront her.

473
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,480
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>莎拉想要挽救她的婚姻
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>Sarah wanted to save her marriage.

474
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,870
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>她认为挽救的办法
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>She thought the way she could do that

475
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,340
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>就是让我在片场消失
<13-15,MANDY BRONSON>was to get me out of the picture.

476
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,650
<13-16,BECKETT>而你想让她再考虑一下
<13-16,BECKETT>And you wanted to urge her to reconsider,

477
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,920
<13-16,BECKETT>她不答应  你就杀了她
<13-16,BECKETT>and when she didn't, you killed her.

478
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,020
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>我承认  我是去见那个贱人
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>I admit, I went to see the bitch.

479
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,120
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>我告诉她安琪拉·坎农是这部剧的灵魂人物
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>I told her Angela Cannon is the heart and soul of the show.

480
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,720
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>但我看出她不会退步之后  就离开了
<13-17,MANDY BRONSON>But when I saw she wouldn't back down, I left.

481
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,120
<13-18,BECKETT>-我不需要杀了她  -为什么
<13-18,BECKETT>- I didn't need to kill her.  - And why is that?

482
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,330
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>因为我还有一手
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>Because I still had a hand to play.

483
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,090
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>每个人都以为《诱惑巷》剧组
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>Everybody thinks Sarah calls the shots

484
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,660
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>莎拉说了算
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>at "Temptation lane."

485
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,950
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>但二把手彼得·康纳利
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>But the second in command, Peter Connelly,

486
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,970
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>他才是电视台真正信任的人
<13-19,MANDY BRONSON>he's the one the network really trusts.

487
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,860
<13-20,BECKETT>你说你还有一手牌是什么意思
<13-20,BECKETT>What is this other hand that you had to play?

488
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,210
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>我做了所有勤奋女演员都会做的事
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>I did what any industrious actress would do.

489
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,340
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>我从摄影棚直接去了他的公寓
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>I went to his apartment straight from the studio

490
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,570
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>然后利用我的魅力
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>and used my powers of persuasion

491
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,990
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>劝服他站在我这一边
<13-21,MANDY BRONSON>to get him on my side.

492
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,920
<13-22,BECKETT>你什么时候离开的
<13-22,BECKETT>When did you leave?

493
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,690
<13-23,MANDY BRONSON>天亮之后
<13-23,MANDY BRONSON>The sun was up.

494
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,580
<13-23,MANDY BRONSON>而我的角色还活着
<13-23,MANDY BRONSON>And my character is still alive.

495
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,740
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>是的  她昨晚来我的公寓了
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>Yeah, she showed up at my apartment last night.

496
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,880
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>-她穿着一件裘皮大衣  -那又如何
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>- She was wearing a fur coat.  - So?

497
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,090
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>只穿了一件
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>Just...

498
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,340
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>裘皮大衣
<14-1,PETER CONNELLY>a fur coat.

499
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,430
<14-3,PETER CONNELLY>当她解开大衣时  我差点心脏病发
<14-3,PETER CONNELLY>And I nearly had a heart attack when she let it slip open.

500
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,850
<14-3,PETER CONNELLY>幻想了这么多年  她就在那儿
<14-3,PETER CONNELLY>Years of fantasizing, and there she was,

501
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,960
<14-4,BECKETT>-站在我面前  -她想要什么
<14-4,BECKETT>- Standing right in front of me.  - And what did she want?

502
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,040
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>她对于莎拉
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>She was all fired up

503
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,620
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>把她的角色写死感到十分不满
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>about Sarah wanting to write her off the show.

504
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,740
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>所以之后我不得不听曼迪概括
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>So then I had to listen to Mandy summarize

505
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,460
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>每一篇赞扬她演技的《肥皂剧文摘》文章
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>every "Soap Digest" article praising her performance.

506
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,060
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>为了让她住嘴
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>Just to make her stop...

507
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,150
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>我答应会去找莎拉谈谈
<14-5,PETER CONNELLY>I agreed that I would talk to Sarah.

508
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,630
<14-6,CASTLE>只不过现在不用谈了
<14-6,CASTLE>Only now you don't have to.

509
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,140
<14-7,PETER CONNELLY>里斯  拿上笔记本电脑加入编剧组
<14-7,PETER CONNELLY>Reese. Grab your laptop and join the group.

510
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,070
<14-7,PETER CONNELLY>-大家都集合了  -你没开玩笑吗
<14-7,PETER CONNELLY>- We're all hands on deck. - You mean it?

511
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,640
<14-9,PETER CONNELLY>我不会问第二次的
<14-9,PETER CONNELLY>I'm not gonna ask you twice.

512
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,570
<14-10,CASTLE>你现在真是不惜冒险啊
<14-10,CASTLE>Sounds like you're pretty desperate.

513
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,320
<14-11,PETER CONNELLY>卡塞尔先生  你一年...出版一本书  是吗
<14-11,PETER CONNELLY>Mr. Castle, you publish, what, one book a year?

514
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,520
<14-12,CASTLE>差不多
<14-12,CASTLE>Give or take.

515
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,560
<14-13,PETER CONNELLY>同样是一年  我们要制作250集剧集
<14-13,PETER CONNELLY>In that same time period, we produce 250 episodes.

516
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,060

<14-13,PETER CONNELLY>Unless, of course, you'd like to jump in.

520
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,980
<14-14,CASTLE>有趣的是  莎拉被杀害了
<14-14,CASTLE>You know what's interesting? With Sarah out of the way,

521
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,250

525
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,730

<14-16,BECKETT>Well, where have I heard that before?

00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,020
<16-12,CASTLE>那你为什么这么沮丧
<16-12,CASTLE>Then why would you be so upset?

552
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,550
<16-13,LAUREN GOLDBERG>因为
<16-13,LAUREN GOLDBERG>Well, because...

553
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,870
<16-13,LAUREN GOLDBERG>她答应过看看我写的剧本

555
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,260
<16-13,LAUREN GOLDBERG>她会帮我联系一名经纪人
<16-13,LAUREN GOLDBERG>she would help me find an agent.

556
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,390
<16-14,BECKETT>她来这儿是跟谁见面
<16-14,BECKETT>Who would she meet when she came here?

557
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
<16-15,LAUREN GOLDBERG>那还重要吗  她都死了
<16-15,LAUREN GOLDBERG>What's it matter? She's dead.

558
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,920
<16-15,LAUREN GOLDBERG>我的机会没了
<16-15,LAUREN GOLDBERG>I lost my chance.

<16-16,CASTLE>我告诉你
<16-16,CASTLE>I'll tell you what--

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,860
<16-16,CASTLE>我跟你做个交易
<16-16,CASTLE>I'll make you a deal.

561
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,440
<16-16,CASTLE>如果你告诉我们发生了什么
<16-16,CASTLE>If you tell us what happened after that,

562
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,660
<16-16,CASTLE>我会读读你的剧本
<16-16,CASTLE>I'll read your script,

563
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,770
<16-16,CASTLE>如果我喜欢的话  我就把它交给我的经纪人
<16-16,CASTLE>and if I like it, I'll give it to my agent.

564
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,910
<16-17,LAUREN GOLDBERG>真的吗
<16-17,LAUREN GOLDBERG>Really?

565
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,250
<16-17,LAUREN GOLDBERG>真的
<16-17,LAUREN GOLDBERG>Really.

566
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,980
<16-19,LAUREN GOLDBERG>她和一个男人见了面  他们坐在角落的那张桌
<16-19,LAUREN GOLDBERG>She met with a guy, and they sat at a table in a corner.

567
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,250
<16-20,BECKETT>你还记得他长得什么样子吗
<16-20,BECKETT>Do you remember what he looked like?

568
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,770
<16-22,LAUREN GOLDBERG>像他  一模一样
<16-22,LAUREN GOLDBERG>Um... like him. Exactly like him.

569
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,930
<16-23,JOHNNY DIMES>一杯双份的浓缩咖啡  好吗
<16-23,JOHNNY DIMES>Uh, give me a double espresso, will ya?

<16-26,JOHNNY DIMES>我认识你吗
<16-26,JOHNNY DIMES>Do I know you?

573
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,840
<16-27,BECKETT>我是莎拉·卡特勒的朋友
<16-27,BECKETT>I'm a friend of Sarah Cutler.

574
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,260
<16-28,JOHNNY DIMES>是吗  钱带来了吗
<16-28,JOHNNY DIMES>Yeah? You bring my money?

575
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,980
<16-29,BECKETT>什么钱
<16-29,BECKETT>What money?

576
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,640
<16-30,JOHNNY DIMES>听着  我做了她让我做的事
<16-30,JOHNNY DIMES>Look, I did what she asked,

577
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,790
<16-30,JOHNNY DIMES>现在我要拿报酬
<16-30,JOHNNY DIMES>and now I want what I'm owed.

578
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,380
<16-31,BECKETT>她让你干什么了
<16-31,BECKETT>And, um, what is it that she asked you to do?

579
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,350
<16-32,JOHNNY DIMES>关你屁事  你到底是谁
<16-32,JOHNNY DIMES>None of your damn business. Who the hell are you?

580
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,490
<16-33,BECKETT>纽约警局的
<16-33,BECKETT>NYPD.

581
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,980
<16-33,BECKETT>莎拉死了  这就是我的事
<16-33,BECKETT>Sarah's dead, so it is my business.

582
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
<16-33,BECKETT>你到底是谁
<16-33,BECKETT>Now... who the hell are you?

583
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,160
<16-34,JOHNNY DIMES>强尼·戴姆斯  我是私家侦探
<16-34,JOHNNY DIMES>Johnny Dimes. I'm a PI.

584
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,030
<16-34,JOHNNY DIMES>莎拉·卡特勒是个客户  她死了是什么意思
<16-34,JOHNNY DIMES>Sarah Cutler was a client. What do you mean, she's dead?

585
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,840
<16-35,CASTLE>"她死了"只有一个意思
<16-35,CASTLE>"She's dead" only really has the one meaning.

586
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,820
<16-36,BECKETT>她雇你调查她的丈夫吗
<16-36,BECKETT>Did she hire you to follow her husband?

587
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,350
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>丈夫  不
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>Husband? No.

588
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,080
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>她雇我调查歌莉娅·钱伯斯
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>She hired me to investigate Gloria Chambers.

589
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,530
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>她妈妈
<16-37,JOHNNY DIMES>The mom.

590
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,190
<16-38,CASTLE>我就知道  她是不是要器官移植
<16-38,CASTLE>I knew it. Was she involved in organ harvesting?

591
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,280
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>那倒没有  但是我可以告诉你
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>That really didn't come up, but I can tell you this--

592
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,190
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>歌莉娅·钱伯斯不是她生母
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>Gloria Chambers isn't her real birth mom.

593
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,740
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>她是个冒牌货
<16-39,JOHNNY DIMES>She's a fake.

594
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,240
<16-40,CASTLE>妈妈不是真正的妈妈
<16-40,CASTLE>Ohh. The mom isn't really the mom?

595
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,850
<16-40,CASTLE>案情不会比这更肥皂了
<16-40,CASTLE>Does it get any soapier tn that?

596
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,660
<17-1,CASTLE>那是私家侦探关于莎拉假妈妈的档案吗
<17-1,CASTLE>Oh, Is that the P.I's file on Sarah's faux mother?

597
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,810
<17-2,BECKETT>是啊  很显然歌莉娅三年前突然出现
<17-2,BECKETT>Yeah, apparently Gloria showed up three years ago

598
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,930
<17-2,BECKETT>声称她是莎拉的妈妈  莎拉起了怀疑
<17-2,BECKETT>claiming to be Sarah's birth mom, and Sarah got suspicious.

599
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,710
<17-2,BECKETT>于是她雇了私家侦探调查歌莉娅的底细
<17-2,BECKETT>So she hired a p.I. in order to look into Gloria's history.

600
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,770
<17-3,CASTLE>歌莉娅到底有什么阴谋诡计呢
<17-3,CASTLE>What nefarious scheme has Gloria set into motion?

601
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,110
<17-3,CASTLE>也许她打算
<17-3,CASTLE>Perhaps she planned...

602
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,500
<17-3,CASTLE>用一个克隆人替换莎拉
<17-3,CASTLE>on replacing Sarah with a clone.

603
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,240
<17-4,BECKETT>她想要莎拉的钱财
<17-4,BECKETT>She wanted Sarah's money.

604
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,200
<17-5,CASTLE>钱财
<17-5,CASTLE>Money?

605
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,830
<17-6,BECKETT>是啊  抱歉捅破了你的泡泡  卡塞尔
<17-6,BECKETT>Yeah. Sorry to burst your bubble, Castle,

606
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,090
<17-6,BECKETT>但是歌莉娅有过保险诈骗的案底
<17-6,BECKETT>But Gloria's got a history of insurance scams

607
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,390
<17-6,BECKETT>还有多个被骗光钱财的丈夫
<17-6,BECKETT>and husbands with empty bank accounts.

608
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,750
<17-8,BECKETT>-把她带过来了吗  -还在找她  发了全境通告
<17-8,BECKETT>- We bringing her in? - Yeah, we're trying. We put out an APB.

609
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,500
<17-8,BECKETT>公寓没有人
<17-8,BECKETT>Her apartment's empty,

610
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,380
<17-8,BECKETT>门卫说早上看到她提着箱子离开了公寓
<17-8,BECKETT>and the doorman saw her leave with a suitcase this morning.

611
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,840
<17-10,BECKETT>也许是戴姆斯告诉了莎拉关于歌莉娅的事
<17-10,BECKETT>So maybe Dimes tells Sarah about Gloria,

612
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,990
<17-10,BECKETT>莎拉跟她对质
<17-10,BECKETT>Sarah confronts her,

613
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,120
<17-10,BECKETT>之后歌莉娅为了防止暴露杀死了莎拉
<17-10,BECKETT>and then Gloria kills sarah in order to avoid exposure.

614
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,830
<17-11,CASTLE>然后在片场假扮伤心的母亲之后
<17-11,CASTLE>And after playing the role of grieving mother on set,

615
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,380
<17-11,CASTLE>歌莉娅知道情况不妙  就逃之夭夭了
<17-11,CASTLE>Gloria knew enough to get the hell out of dodge.

616
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,620
<17-12,ESPOSITO>看看是谁在肯尼迪机场
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Yo. Look who got caught

617
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,060
<17-12,ESPOSITO>想买飞往巴哈马的机票  被逮了正着
<17-12,ESPOSITO>trying to buy a ticket to the Bahamas at J.F.K.

618
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,240
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>-歌莉娅  -纽约的一切都让我想起莎拉
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>- Gloria. - Everything in New York reminded me of Sarah.

619
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,230
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我想让自己
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I needed to distance myself

620
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,340
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>忘却她已离我而去的苦痛现实
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>from the agonizing truth that she's dead.

621
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,830
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>如果逃避是罪过的话
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Now if denial is a crime...

622
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,940
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我认罪
<17-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I plead guilty.

623
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,230
<17-15,BECKETT>不错啊
<17-15,BECKETT>Good to know.

624
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,530
<17-15,BECKETT>谋杀的指控  你打算怎么办
<17-15,BECKETT>Now how do you plead on murder?

625
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,130
<18-1,BECKETT>歌莉娅·钱伯斯  也就是莎琳·塞勒斯
<18-1,BECKETT>Gloria Chambers, also known as Charlene Sellars.

626
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,760
<18-1,BECKETT>你真是个大忙人啊
<18-1,BECKETT>You have been a very busy woman.

627
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,360
<18-2,CASTLE>你还真是贫穷到富裕的典范啊
<18-2,CASTLE>Yours is a real rags-to-riches story.

628
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,000
<18-2,CASTLE>唯一的问题是  那些钱都不是你
<18-2,CASTLE>Only trouble is, the riches never seem to be yours.

629
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,570
<18-3,BECKETT>在福罗里达州诈骗
<18-3,BECKETT>Fraud in Florida,

630
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,750
<18-3,BECKETT>在北卡罗来纳州盗用公款
<18-3,BECKETT>Embezzlement in North Carolina--

631
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,100
<18-4,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我为之前的那些误会都服过刑了
<18-4,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I served my time for those prior misunderstandings.

632
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,260
<18-5,BECKETT>然后你找到了你的下一任"饭票"
<18-5,BECKETT>And then you latched on to your next meal ticket--

633
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,150
<18-5,BECKETT>康斯坦丁·皮瑞利
<18-5,BECKETT>Constantine Pirelli.

634
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,610
<18-5,BECKETT>在他之后是埃内斯托·克鲁兹
<18-5,BECKETT>After him, it was Ernesto Cruz.

635
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,930
<18-6,CASTLE>我听说他们很希望你能赶紧回去
<18-6,CASTLE>I hear they're very anxious for you to come back...

636
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,250
<18-6,CASTLE>把钱还给他们
<18-6,CASTLE>with their money.

637
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,200
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我跟他们结过婚  钱是我们的
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I was married to those men. It was our money.

638
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,740
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我可以告诉你
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I can tell you,

639
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,320
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>每一分都是我辛苦赚来的
<18-7,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I earned every penny.

640
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,560
<18-8,BECKETT>但是你每次都会把钱挥霍光  再寻觅
<18-8,BECKETT>But as usual, you blew it all, and so you looked for

641
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,740
<18-8,BECKETT>下一任"饭票"  于是你找上了莎拉·卡特勒
<18-8,BECKETT>your next ticket, which you found in Sarah Cutler.

642
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,460
<18-9,CASTLE>你在采访中听她提起
<18-9,CASTLE>You heard an interview where she mentioned

643
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,050
<18-9,CASTLE>她是被领养的  你做了点研究
<18-9,CASTLE>being adopted, did a little research,

644
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,660
<18-9,CASTLE>然后装成是她那失散多年的母亲
<18-9,CASTLE>and then showed up as the long-lost mother.

645
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,550
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>莎拉的确有可能误以为
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Sarah might have been under the impression

646
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,760
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>她是我女儿  但是我没有杀她
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>that she was my daughter, but I didn't kill her.

647
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,900
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我是说  我以我自己的方式
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I mean, in my own way, I was--

648
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,650
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我其实挺喜欢莎拉的
<18-10,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I was fond of Sarah.

649
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,380
<18-11,BECKETT>喜欢到假扮成她的妈妈
<18-11,BECKETT>Fond enough that you were able to masquerade as her mother.

650
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,860
<18-11,BECKETT>你有杀害她的动机
<18-11,BECKETT>You had motive to kill her.

651
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,160
<18-11,BECKETT>-所以你才会想逃出本土  -什么动机
<18-11,BECKETT>- That's why you tried to flee the country. - What motive?

652
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,800
<18-13,BECKETT>她的遗嘱显示她打算留给你30万美元
<18-13,BECKETT>Her will shows she plan to leave you $300,000.

653
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,550
<18-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我的莎拉是个慷慨的孩子
<18-14,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Mm. She's a generous girl, my Sarah.

654
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,880
<18-15,CASTLE>-她不是你的莎拉  -那也不是你的钱
<18-15,CASTLE>- She's not your sarah. - And that's not your money.

655
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,220
<18-16,BECKETT>你知道她把你写进了遗嘱
<18-16,BECKETT>You knew she wrote you into her will.

656
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,850
<18-16,BECKETT>事实上  这一切备不住都是你一手操控的
<18-16,BECKETT>In fact, you probably planned it all along.

657
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,950
<18-16,BECKETT>当她质问你的时候
<18-16,BECKETT>When she confronted you,

658
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,810
<18-16,BECKETT>你知道自己别无他法
<18-16,BECKETT>you knew that you had a narrow window

659
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,250
<18-16,BECKETT>只能在她揭穿你之前杀了她
<18-16,BECKETT>within which to kill her before she wrote you out.

660
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,470
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>问题在于
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Here's your problem--

661
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,100
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我不是你们要找的凶手
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I am not your killer.

662
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,580
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>如果我是你  我会查查她身边的那个男人
<18-17,GLORIA CHAMBERS>If I were you, I'd look into the other man in her life.

663
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,620
<18-19,GLORIA CHAMBERS>-哪个男人  -那个给了她
<18-19,GLORIA CHAMBERS>- What other man? - The one that gave her

664
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,770
<18-19,GLORIA CHAMBERS>两克拉亚瑟·克莱恩耳环的男人
<18-19,GLORIA CHAMBERS>the 2-karat Arthur Klein earrings just the other day.

665
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,910
<18-20,BECKETT>你知道这个人的名字吗
<18-20,BECKETT>Does this other man have a name?

666
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,180
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>莎拉没告诉我
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Sarah didn't tell me that,

667
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,390
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>不管他是谁  他们肯定是刚刚分手
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>But whoever he was, they must have just split up,

668
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,800
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>因为他在试图赢回她的心
<18-21,GLORIA CHAMBERS>because he was trying to win her over.

669
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,660
<18-22,BECKETT>不是吧  你把嫌疑指向一个神秘陌生人
<18-22,BECKETT>Really? You're gonna point us to a mysterious stranger?

670
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,540
<18-24,BECKETT>-这是事实  -出自一个职业骗子之口
<18-24,BECKETT>- It's the truth. - Coming from a professional liar.

671
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,400
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>她死的时候  我根本不在这破烂的
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I was nowhere near this godforsaken soap set

672
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,110
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>肥皂剧片场附近  我...
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>when she died. I...

673
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,160
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>我在利用闲暇做有用的事
<18-25,GLORIA CHAMBERS>I was doing something useful with my time.

674
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,660
<18-26,CASTLE>给盲人读书吗
<18-26,CASTLE>Reading to the blind.

675
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,200
<18-27,GLORIA CHAMBERS>差不多吧  我去捐钱了
<18-27,GLORIA CHAMBERS>Em, close. I was donating.

676
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,340
<18-27,GLORIA CHAMBERS>捐给小马驹[指赌马]
<18-27,GLORIA CHAMBERS>to the ponies.

677
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,630
<19-1,ESPOSITO>歌莉娅钱包里的两张收据显示
<19-1,ESPOSITO>The two receipts in Gloria's purse

678
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,290
<19-1,ESPOSITO>下注时间是晚上10点
<19-1,ESPOSITO>put a betting on races at 10 p. m..

679
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,480
<19-2,BECKETT>死亡时间区的下限是晚上11点
<19-2,BECKETT>And the time of death is estimated at 11:00 on the outside,

680
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,530
<19-2,BECKETT>我们没有任何证据将她和摄影棚联系起来
<19-2,BECKETT>and we don't have anything to tie her to the studio.

681
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,750
<19-3,CASTLE>我原以为凶手肯定是假妈妈
<19-3,CASTLE>I thought fake mom was a lock.

682
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,200
<19-4,RYAN>而且她的嫌疑越来越小
<19-4,RYAN>It's starting to look less that way by the minute.

683
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,930
<19-4,RYAN>我在莎拉的公寓发现了歌莉娅
<19-4,RYAN>I found the earrings that Gloria talked about

684
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,480
<19-4,RYAN>-说起的耳环  -高档货
<19-4,RYAN>- in Sarah's apartment. - Fancy.

685
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,460
<19-6,BECKETT>是啊  超过一万块的高档货
<19-6,BECKETT>Yeah, over 10 grand worth of fancy.

686
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,850
<19-7,ESPOSITO>这值一万块
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Those are worth over 10 grand?

687
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,530
<19-8,BECKETT>-拜托  -蕾妮最爱钻石了
<19-8,BECKETT>- Please. - Lanie loves diamonds.

688
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,890
<19-9,CASTLE>"钻石恒久远  我对你的爱也是如此"
<19-9,CASTLE>"Diamonds are forever like my devotion to you."

689
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,300
<19-9,CASTLE>谁写得出这么肉麻的话
<19-9,CASTLE>Who writes notes this cheesy?

690
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,170
<19-10,RYAN>反正不是她老公
<19-10,RYAN>Well, not the husband.

691
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,830
<19-10,RYAN>我查了他的财务支出  他没买过这个
<19-10,RYAN>I checked on his financials. He didn't buy them.

692
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,990
<19-11,BECKETT>好吧  也许歌莉娅说的是事实
<19-11,BECKETT>Okay, so maybe Gloria was telling us the truth.

693
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,090
<19-11,BECKETT>也许莎拉也有外遇
<19-11,BECKETT>Maybe Sarah was having an affair.

694
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,140
<19-12,CASTLE>这就说得通了
<19-12,CASTLE>Well, that makes perfect sense.

695
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,180
<19-12,CASTLE>莎拉跟她的丈夫文斯分居了
<19-12,CASTLE>Sarah was seperated from her husband Vince,

696
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,830
<19-12,CASTLE>一天天繁杂枯燥的工作之后
<19-12,CASTLE>and after long, grueling days at work,

697
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,800
<19-12,CASTLE>她回到冰凉空荡的公寓
<19-12,CASTLE>she'd go home to a cold, empty apartment.

698
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,390
<19-12,CASTLE>感到寂寞和背叛  于是她在这个
<19-12,CASTLE>Feeling lonely, betrayed, she seeks comfort

699
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,950
<19-12,CASTLE>神秘男子的怀中寻求安慰
<19-12,CASTLE>in the arms of this mystery man...

700
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,080
<19-13,BECKETT>可她决定要挽回她的丈夫
<19-13,BECKETT>And she decides that she wants her husband back,

701
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,620
<19-13,BECKETT>所以写死了他的情妇曼迪·布朗森的角色
<19-13,BECKETT>so writes his mistress, mandy Bronson, off the show

702
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,830
<19-13,BECKETT>以求拯救他们的婚姻
<19-13,BECKETT>in order to save their marriage.

703
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,470
<19-14,CASTLE>她下一步要做的  就是摆脱这个男人
<19-14,CASTLE>And her next stop would be to get rid of the other man.

704
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,930
<19-15,BECKETT>所以也许是这个男人并不甘心放手  销声匿迹
<19-15,BECKETT>So maybe the other man didn't go off quietly into the night.

705
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,270
<19-16,RYAN>我们不在的时候  你们练习接话吗
<19-16,RYAN>Do you two practice this when we're not around?

706
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,340
<19-17,BECKETT>这对耳环只在
<19-17,BECKETT>These earrings are exclusive

707
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,390
<19-17,BECKETT>切尔西区的亚瑟·克莱恩精品店有售
<19-17,BECKETT>to Arthur Klein's boutique in Chelsea.

708
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,300
<19-17,BECKETT>去查查是谁买的
<19-17,BECKETT>Let's find out who bought them.

709
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,530
<20-1,BECKETT>现在歌莉娅没有嫌疑了
<20-1,BECKETT>Okay, so Gloria is in the clear.

710
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,120
<20-1,BECKETT>警员拿着她的照片在外围赌马场询问过
<20-1,BECKETT>Uniforms showed her photo at O.T.B.,

711
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,550
<20-1,BECKETT>一个酒保记得在11点一刻看见过她
<20-1,BECKETT>and a bartender there remembers seeing her at 11:15.

712
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,240
<20-2,CASTLE>我能明白她为什么中了歌莉娅的计
<20-2,CASTLE>You know, I can see why she fell for gloria's con.

713
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,820
<20-2,CASTLE>莎拉没有母亲  没有孩子
<20-2,CASTLE>Sarah was motherless, childless.

714
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,050
<20-2,CASTLE>她照料着年轻的编剧们
<20-2,CASTLE>She was taking young writers under her wing.

715
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,820
<20-2,CASTLE>-她在寻求亲情  -卡塞尔
<20-2,CASTLE>- She was looking for family. - Wow, Castle.

716
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,280
<20-3,BECKETT>这还真是很实际的推理啊
<20-3,BECKETT>That's a refreshingly down-to-earth theory.

717
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,650
<20-4,CASTLE>就是为了让你随时保持警觉
<20-4,CASTLE>Just trying to keep you on your toes.

718
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,770
<20-5,RYAN>我们去查克莱恩的精品店的交易记录
<20-5,RYAN>Hey, so we ran down purchases at Klein's boutique,

719
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,170
<20-5,RYAN>猜猜查到了谁
<20-5,RYAN>and guess who popped.

720
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,060
<20-6,ESPOSITO>-兰斯·哈斯丁  -这还没完
<20-6,ESPOSITO>- Lance Hastings? - And that's not all.

721
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,120
<20-6,ESPOSITO>我查了兰斯的信用卡记录
<20-6,ESPOSITO>I ran Lance's credit card activity

722
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,020
<20-6,ESPOSITO>以确定是他购买的
<20-6,ESPOSITO>to confirm the purchase

723
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,480
<20-6,ESPOSITO>结果另有发现
<20-6,ESPOSITO>and something else caught my eye.

724
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,110
<20-6,ESPOSITO>兰斯在谋杀案发生当晚叫了一辆出租车
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Lance charged a cab ride to the studio

725
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,150
<20-6,ESPOSITO>载他去了摄影棚
<20-6,ESPOSITO>the night of the murder.

726
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,030
<20-7,RYAN>是啊  我们询问他的时候
<20-7,RYAN>Yeah, when we interviewed him,

727
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,840
<20-7,RYAN>他说他6点就直接回家了
<20-7,RYAN>he said he went straight home at 6:00 p.m.

728
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,060
<20-8,ESPOSITO>出租车公司的车8点载他回了摄影棚
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Cab company drove him back to the studio around 8:00.

729
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,570
<20-9,BECKETT>这个时间刚好在我们推算的死亡时间区内
<20-9,BECKETT>Okay, so that falls right within the window of our time of death.

730
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,590
<20-9,BECKETT>把他带过来
<20-9,BECKETT>Go pick him up.

731
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,770
<20-10,RYAN>我们派了警员过去
<20-10,RYAN>Yeah, we already sent a uniform.

732
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,450
<20-10,RYAN>他不在家  也不接电话
<20-10,RYAN>He's not home, and he's not answering his phone.

733
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,960
<20-11,CASTLE>我母亲之前在片场跟他聊过
<20-11,CASTLE>My mother was speaking to him earlier on set.

734
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,470
<20-11,CASTLE>嗨宝贝  奶奶在吗  我要跟她说话
<20-11,CASTLE>Hi, sweetie. Is gram there? I need to talk to her.

735
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,760
<20-12,BECKETT>怎么了
<20-12,BECKETT>What's wrong?

736
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,380
<20-13,CASTLE>我知道凶手在哪
<20-13,CASTLE>I know where the killer is.

737
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,190
<20-13,CASTLE>他跟我妈在一起
<20-13,CASTLE>He's with my mother.

738
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,860
<21-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没事的
<21-1,BECKETT>Castle, it's okay.

739
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,030
<21-1,BECKETT>我确定你妈妈没有危险
<21-1,BECKETT>I'm sure your mom's not in any danger.

740
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,980
<21-2,CASTLE>是啊  你大概是对的
<21-2,CASTLE>Yeah, you're probably right.

741
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,720
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>我很抱歉  亲爱的
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>I'm sorry, my dear,

742
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,260
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>但在我把一切都告诉你之后
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>but after everything I've told you,

743
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,840
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>我不能让你活着离开这个房间
<21-3,LANCE HASTINGS>I can't let you leave this room alive.

744
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,170
<21-4,MARTHA>兰斯  好好想想你要做的事
<21-4,MARTHA>Lance, think about what you're doing.

745
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,610
<21-5,LANCE HASTINGS>我正想着呢
<21-5,LANCE HASTINGS>I am thinking about it.

746
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,320
<21-6,MARTHA>-我不能留你活口  -想想我们...
<21-6,MARTHA>- I can't let you live! - Think about us--

747
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,210
<21-8,CASTLE>-把刀放下  -什么
<21-8,CASTLE>- Drop the knife! - What--

748
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,180
<21-9,BECKETT>-放下武器  -等等
<21-9,BECKETT>- Drop the weapon. - W-w-w-wait a minute.

749
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,240
<21-11,MARTHA>理查德  你在做什么
<21-11,MARTHA>Richard, what are you doing?

750
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,360
<21-12,CASTLE>没什么  救你的命而已
<21-12,CASTLE>Oh, nothing. Just saving your life. That's all.

751
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,050
<21-12,CASTLE>她说把刀放下
<21-12,CASTLE>She said drop the knife!

752
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,340
<21-13,MARTHA>这刀唯一能切的东西  就是黄油
<21-13,MARTHA>The only thing that knife could kill is butter.

753
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,980
<21-14,CASTLE>你们说什么呢
<21-14,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

754
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,300
<21-15,BECKETT>这是个道具
<21-15,BECKETT>It's a prop.

755
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,090
<21-16,LANCE HASTINGS>我们是在排演一出戏
<21-16,LANCE HASTINGS>We were just working out a scene.

756
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,940
<21-17,MARTHA>各位  这完全是我的主意
<21-17,MARTHA>Guys, it was completely my idea.

757
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,510
<21-17,MARTHA>演员版的"教我怎么挥高尔夫球杆"
<21-17,MARTHA>You know, the actor's version of "Show me your golf swing."

758
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,520
<21-18,CASTLE>这把刀也许是假的
<21-18,CASTLE>Well, the knife may be fake,

759
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,790
<21-18,CASTLE>但是你插进莎拉后背的斧子是真的
<21-18,CASTLE>but the ax you put into Sarah's back was real.

760
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,270
<22-1,BECKETT>你对莱恩警探和埃斯波西托警探撒谎
<22-1,BECKETT>You lied to detectives Ryan and Esposito

761
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,860
<22-1,BECKETT>没有坦诚交代凶案当晚你的去处
<22-1,BECKETT>regarding your whereabouts the night of the murder.

762
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,720
<22-2,LANCE HASTINGS>你想知道真相
<22-2,LANCE HASTINGS>You want the truth?

763
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,240
<22-3,BECKETT>你解释一下会比较好
<22-3,BECKETT>That would be a great place to start.

764
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,820
<22-4,LANCE HASTINGS>真相你们接受不了
<22-4,LANCE HASTINGS>You can't handle the truth.

765
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,450
<22-5,BECKETT>先生  我对你模仿杰克·尼科尔森
<22-5,BECKETT>Sir, I am not interested in your

766
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,630
<22-5,BECKETT>不感兴趣
<22-5,BECKETT>Jack Nicholson impressions.

767
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,650
<22-5,BECKETT>我们知道你在案发当晚
<22-5,BECKETT>We know that you went back to the studio

768
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,040
<22-5,BECKETT>回到了摄影棚
<22-5,BECKETT>the night of the murder.

769
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,080
<22-5,BECKETT>而我要问的是  你回去干什么了
<22-5,BECKETT>And what I'm asking is why.

770
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,500
<22-6,LANCE HASTINGS>只是进行同事间友好的对话
<22-6,LANCE HASTINGS>It was a friendly conversation between colleagues.

771
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,130
<22-7,BECKETT>在这个友好对话中  她告诉你
<22-7,BECKETT>A friendly conversation in which she told you

772
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,960
<22-7,BECKETT>她要回到她丈夫身边
<22-7,BECKETT>she was going to go back to her husband.

773
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
<22-8,LANCE HASTINGS>你们到底在说什么啊
<22-8,LANCE HASTINGS>What the hell are you talking about?

774
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,230
<22-9,CASTLE>-她为什么说这个  -因为她在跟你分手
<22-9,CASTLE>- Why would she do that? - Because she was breaking up with you.

775
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,930
<22-10,LANCE HASTINGS>你们以为是这么回事吗
<22-10,LANCE HASTINGS>Is that what you think is going on here?

776
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,820
<22-10,LANCE HASTINGS>你们以为莎拉和我是情人关系吗
<22-10,LANCE HASTINGS>You think that sarah and I were lovers?

777
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,500
<22-11,BECKETT>你有没有
<22-11,BECKETT>Did you or did you not

778
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,370
<22-11,BECKETT>送过她一副昂贵的钻石耳环
<22-11,BECKETT>buy an expensive pair of diamond earrings for her?

779
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,830
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>送过  但不是为了取悦她
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>Yes, but not to woo her.

780
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,460
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>这是为了让莎拉同意让我
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>It was to encourage Sarah

781
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,600
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>-在合约之外接拍一部电影  -演电影
<22-12,LANCE HASTINGS>- to let me out of my contract for a movie role. - Movie role?

783
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,780
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>没错  科恩兄弟邀请我参演
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>Yes. The Coen Brothers have asked me to play

784
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,650
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>马特·达蒙新片里的脑残老爸
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>Matt Damon's half-wit dad in their new movie.

785
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,110
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>这角色简直是一生才碰到一次
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>It's a role of a lifetime.

786
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,680
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>非常有被颁奖礼提名的范儿
<22-14,LANCE HASTINGS>It has nominations written all over it.

787
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,770
<22-15,BECKETT>这也解释不了
<22-15,BECKETT>That still doesn't explain

788
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,770
<22-15,BECKETT>当晚你为何回到片场
<22-15,BECKETT>why you went back to the studio that night.

789
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,130
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>我去当面感谢莎拉
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>I went to thank Sarah in person,

790
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,350
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>因为我的经纪人打电话给我
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>because my agent called me

791
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,230
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>说她同意我演那电影
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>that evening to tell that she'd agreed to let me out.

792
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,000
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>我之所以之前没说
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>The reason that I didn't mention any of it is

793
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,560
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>是因为我不想冒险失去拍电影的机会
<22-16,LANCE HASTINGS>that I didn't wanna risk missing work on the movie.

794
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,890
<22-17,BECKETT>你为何不直接打给她
<22-17,BECKETT>Why didn't you just call her?

795
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,130
<22-18,LANCE HASTINGS>我想让她知道我有多感激
<22-18,LANCE HASTINGS>I wanted her to know how much I appreciated it.

796
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,060
<22-19,BECKETT>所以你回去感谢她  仅此而已
<22-19,BECKETT>So you went back to thank her, and that's it?

797
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,110
<22-19,BECKETT>不  也不尽然
<22-19,BECKETT>No, not exactly. Uh...

798
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,980
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>我到那儿的时候  她在读一份剧本
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>when I got there, she was reading a script,

799
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,500
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>看起来很难过
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>and she seemed upset.

800
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,310
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>我问她为什么
<22-20,LANCE HASTINGS>I asked her why, and...

801
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,120
<22-21,BECKETT>她说有人背叛了她
<22-21,BECKETT>she said somebody had betrayed her.

802
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,860
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>-是谁  -起初我以为是我
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>- Who? - Well, at first, I thought it was me

803
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,910
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>因为接演了电影  但是后来
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>for taking the movie role, but then...

804
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,690
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>她说  是有人并非
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>she said that someone wasn't who...

805
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,420
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>如她想的那样
<22-22,LANCE HASTINGS>she thought they were.

806
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,480
<22-23,CASTLE>她没具体说这个人是谁吗
<22-23,CASTLE>And she didn't let on as to who this person was?

807
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,860
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>没有  我不想让她
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>No. I didn't want to give her the opportunity

808
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,490
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>在电影的事情上改变主意
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>to change her mind about the movie,

809
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,370
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>所以退场了  从舞台左侧
<22-24,LANCE HASTINGS>So I exited... stage left.

810
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,640
<23-1,BECKETT>好了  找到了莎拉签署的
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay. Found the deal memo that Sarah signed

811
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,670
<23-1,BECKETT>让兰斯出演电影的合同备忘了
<23-1,BECKETT>in order to get Lance out for his movie.

812
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,710
<23-2,CASTLE>他没在撒谎
<23-2,CASTLE>He wasn't lying.

813
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,170
<23-2,CASTLE>我妈绝对饶不了我
<23-2,CASTLE>My mother is never gonna let me forget this.

814
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,570
<23-3,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  她可能在想
<23-3,BECKETT>Oh, come on, Castle. She'll probably think

815
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,860
<23-3,BECKETT>你这么关心她  真是贴心呢
<23-3,BECKETT>it was sweet that you were concerned about her.

816
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,830
<23-4,CASTLE>我们说的可是玛莎·罗杰斯
<23-4,CASTLE>This is Martha Rodgers we are talking about.

817
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,110
<23-4,CASTLE>我破坏了属于她的"时刻"
<23-4,CASTLE>I intruded on her "Moment."

818
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,010
<23-4,CASTLE>不  我会付出惨痛代价的
<23-4,CASTLE>No, I will pay dearly.

819
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,270
<23-5,BECKETT>兰斯来的时候  莎拉告诉他
<23-5,BECKETT>When Lance came here, Sarah told him

820
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,640
<23-5,BECKETT>有人并非她想的那样
<23-5,BECKETT>that someone wasn't who she thought they were.

821
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,000
<23-5,BECKETT>你觉得那说的是谁
<23-5,BECKETT>Who do you think that was?

822
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,510
<23-6,CASTLE>那个把我妈衬托的跟圣徒一样的女人
<23-6,CASTLE>How about the woman who makes my mother look like a saint?

823
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,800
<23-7,BECKETT>没错  但是莎拉已经把歌莉娅踢出她的生活了
<23-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but Sarah already cut Gloria out of her life.

824
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,950
<23-7,BECKETT>也许  也许是她偷情的丈夫
<23-7,BECKETT>Maybe... maybe it was her cheating husband.

825
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,490
<23-8,CASTLE>可是兰斯是在曼迪·布朗森之后跟莎拉见得面
<23-8,CASTLE>Except Lance met with Sarah after Mandy Bronson.

826
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,230
<23-8,CASTLE>曼迪出现的时候  莎拉已经决定
<23-8,CASTLE>By the time Mandy showed up, Sarah had already decided

827
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,570
<23-8,CASTLE>要挽回自己的婚姻了
<23-8,CASTLE>what she wanted to do with her marriage.

828
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,870
<23-9,BECKETT>是啊  但就算莎拉打定主意
<23-9,BECKETT>Yeah, but even if Sarah decided

829
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,500
<23-9,BECKETT>她要跟文斯重归于好
<23-9,BECKETT>that she was gonna get back together with Vince,

830
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,310
<23-9,BECKETT>也不表示她就没有疑问
<23-9,BECKETT>it doesn't mean that she didn't have doubts.

831
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,250
<23-10,CASTLE>没错  你说得对
<23-10,CASTLE>No. No, you're right.

832
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,400
<23-10,CASTLE>可他有不在场证明
<23-10,CASTLE>Except he has an alibi.

833
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,950
<23-10,CASTLE>每个人都有不在场证明
<23-10,CASTLE>Everyone has an alibi.

834
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,250
<23-11,BECKETT>好吧  有人没有
<23-11,BECKETT>Yeah, well, somebody out there doesn't,

835
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,620
<23-11,BECKETT>我们会找到的
<23-11,BECKETT>And we are gonna find them.

836
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,160
<23-12,CASTLE>也许我们该睡一觉想一想
<23-12,CASTLE>Well, maybe we should sleep on it.

837
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,450
<23-13,CASTLE>各睡各的
<23-13,CASTLE>Separately.

838
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,800
<23-13,CASTLE>凯瑟琳·贝克特  我可是绅士
<23-13,CASTLE>Katherine Beckett, I never.

839
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,550
<24-1,CASTLE>女士们好啊
<24-1,CASTLE>Hello, ladies.

840
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,830
<24-2,ALEXIS>嗨  老爸  奶奶告诉我
<24-2,ALEXIS>Hey, dad. Gram told me

841
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,130
<24-2,ALEXIS>你是怎么在她的约会上充英雄的
<24-2,ALEXIS>how you went all Jason Bourne on her date.

842
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,810
<24-3,CASTLE>拜托  危难时我所展现的大无畏精神
<24-3,CASTLE>Come on. I think I deserve some kudos for my selfless courage

843
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,270
<24-3,CASTLE>应该得到嘉奖才对嘛
<24-3,CASTLE>in the face of perceived danger.

844
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,260
<24-4,MARTHA>随你怎么想
<24-4,MARTHA>Ah, think what you will.

845
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,670
<24-4,MARTHA>但我已经自作主张选好了道歉礼物
<24-4,MARTHA>But I've taken the liberty of selecting an apology gift--

846
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,550
<24-4,MARTHA>47页  帮你折了页
<24-4,MARTHA>Page 47, dog-eared for your convenience.

847
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,320
<24-6,MARTHA>-这条裙子  -对  还有这双鞋
<24-6,MARTHA>- The dress? - Uh-huh. And the shoes.

848
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,120
<24-6,MARTHA>对了  还有这个包包
<24-6,MARTHA>Oh! And the purse.

849
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,640
<24-6,MARTHA>儿子  这个是哪儿来的
<24-6,MARTHA>Where did you get this, darling?

850
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,720
<24-7,CASTLE>办案认识的一个女的
<24-7,CASTLE>Oh, from a woman I met on the case.

851
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,880
<24-7,CASTLE>很有抱负的一位编剧
<24-7,CASTLE>She's an aspiring writer.

852
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,160
<24-7,CASTLE>我一心软就答应给她看看
<24-7,CASTLE>In a moment of weakness, I told her I'd read it.

853
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,190
<24-8,MARTHA>写得很不错  角色鲜明
<24-8,MARTHA>Oh, it's really pretty good. She's got very vivid characters,

854
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,040
<24-8,MARTHA>情节合理  还很重口味哦
<24-8,MARTHA>Well plotted, pleasantly salacious.

855
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
<24-9,CASTLE>正好  我就这么跟她说
<24-9,CASTLE>Great. That's what I'll tell her.

856
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,700
<24-10,MARTHA>那可不行  你答应人家你会看  是你
<24-10,MARTHA>No, no, no, no. You said you would read it, honey. You.

857
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,690
<24-10,MARTHA>我看行了吧
<24-10,MARTHA>I will.

858
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,400
<24-11,CASTLE>不过我还得再琢磨一下
<24-11,CASTLE>I just have to do a little

859
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,160
<24-11,CASTLE>-这个案子  -他分明是在拖延
<24-11,CASTLE>- more thinking on the case. - He's procrastinating.

860
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,600
<24-13,CASTLE>-我知道  -不是拖延
<24-13,CASTLE>- I know. I know. - No, I am not.

861
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,840
<24-13,CASTLE>最关键的谜团快真相大白了
<24-13,CASTLE>I am just about to solve a critical piece of our mystery.

862
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,930
<24-14,MARTHA>你确定兰斯不是斧头杀手了吧
<24-14,MARTHA>Now that you've determined that Lance is not the ax murderer?

863
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,040
<24-15,ALEXIS>老爸  那最关键的证据是什么
<24-15,ALEXIS>So what's the critical piece of evidence, dad?

864
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
<24-16,CASTLE>莎拉·卡特勒被害前
<24-16,CASTLE>Well, shortly before she died,

865
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,790
<24-16,CASTLE>说有人背叛她
<24-16,CASTLE>Sarah Cutler said that someone had betrayed her.

866
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,470
<24-16,CASTLE>我判断那个人就是凶手
<24-16,CASTLE>I think that person is our killer.

867
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,200
<24-17,MARTHA>儿子  这么说的话谁都有可能
<24-17,MARTHA>Well, then it could be anybody, darling,

868
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,860
<24-17,MARTHA>背叛可是肥皂剧的经典桥段
<24-17,MARTHA>because betrayal is a way of life on a soap opera.

869
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,120
<24-17,MARTHA>就说《诱惑巷》吧
<24-17,MARTHA>And let me tell you, "Temptation lane"

870
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,560
<24-17,MARTHA>整个一贪婪
<24-17,MARTHA>is like this seething cauldron

871
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,530
<24-17,MARTHA>背叛和野心的大杂烩
<24-17,MARTHA>of sordidness and treachery and naked ambition.

872
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,070
<24-17,MARTHA>你知道什么样的人
<24-17,MARTHA>And you know which people

873
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,630
<24-17,MARTHA>最有控制欲  最阴险狡诈吗
<24-17,MARTHA>are the most manipulative and devious?

874
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,690
<24-18,CASTLE>知道
<24-18,CASTLE>I do.

875
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,760
<24-18,CASTLE>我知道背叛莎拉的是谁了
<24-18,CASTLE>I know who betrayed Sarah.

876
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,160
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>合同里面没说
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>Look, there's nothing in my contract

877
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,490
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>突然要我演警察呀
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>that says that I have to be a cop all of a sudden.

878
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,860
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>我这边有彩排
<25-1,LANCE HASTINGS>I-I--I've gotta rehearse.

879
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,860
<25-2,MANDY BRONSON>别打了  开拍吧  快点
<25-2,MANDY BRONSON>Get off the phone. Let's do this. Let's go.

<25-4,BECKETT>- Okay, Castle. Let's go. - Oh, wait.

<25-5,CASTLE>别急  等会儿  这可是我的肥皂剧处女编
<25-5,CASTLE>No, hang on. I just wrote my first soap scene,

882
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,990
<25-5,CASTLE>快要拍了
<25-5,CASTLE>which they are about to shoot.

883
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,300
<25-6,BECKETT>没事  我看电视就行  得去抓人了
<25-6,BECKETT>Well, I'll--I'll catch it on TV. We've got an arrest to make.

884
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,870
<25-7,CASTLE>不用去了  等着  这场戏会让凶手现形
<25-7,CASTLE>No, no, wait. This scene is going to expose the killer.

885
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,780
<25-7,CASTLE>唯在戏剧中  我等方能窥见
<25-7,CASTLE>"The play's the thing wherein we'll catch

886
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,910
<25-7,CASTLE>王的本心  引自《哈姆雷特》
<25-7,CASTLE>the conscience of the king"-- Hamlet.

887
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,320
<25-8,BECKETT>我们已经知道凶手是谁了
<25-8,BECKETT>We already know who the killer is,

888
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
<25-8,BECKETT>你这是浪费时间  引自我的语录
<25-8,BECKETT>so you're wasting my time-- me.

889
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,550
<25-9,CASTLE>我要是能让她认罪呢
<25-9,CASTLE>Not if I get us a confession.

890
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,710

<27-11,MANDY BRONSON>-切到一号镜头  -那我赢了吗
<27-11,MANDY BRONSON>- Over to one. - So did I win?

918
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,480
<27-12,VINCE POWERS>三号镜头
<27-12,VINCE POWERS>Three.

919
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,710
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>我今天早上去咖啡馆
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>I went to the coffee shop this morning,

920
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,920
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>有个店员请我看一下
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>and a barista there asked me to read an article

921
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,560
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>她的大学作业
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>that she had written for her college paper.

922
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,330
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>奇怪的是  居然和你的一模一样
<27-13,LANCE HASTINGS>Oddly enough, it was identical to yours.

923
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,090
<27-14,MANDY BRONSON>-肯定是误会了  -不是误会
<27-14,MANDY BRONSON>- There must be some mistake. - No,

924
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,110
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>就是你交上去那篇  你以为
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>just the one you made in assuming that you could

925
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,500
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>别人的东西能被这样占为己有吗
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>pass off somebody else's material as your own.

926
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,350
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>安琪拉  你是个骗子
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>You are a fraud, Angela.

927
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,220
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>我要打电话告诉奖学金委员会
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>And I am going to call the fellowship

928
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,900
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>让他们知道你的真面目
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>and let them know that exactly.

929
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,290
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>对了  还有
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>Oh, and by the way...

930
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,090
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>你被解雇了
<27-15,LANCE HASTINGS>you're fired.

931
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,710
<27-16,VINCE POWERS>卡  大家演得不错
<27-16,VINCE POWERS>And cut. Nice job, people.

932
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,040
<27-17,REESE HARMON>我有点不明白  这个...
<27-17,REESE HARMON>I don't understand. This is--

933
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,570
<27-17,REESE HARMON>这好像不是我们昨天讨论的剧本
<27-17,REESE HARMON>This is not the scene that we worked on yesterday.

934
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,180
<27-18,PETER CONNELLY>做了一些调整
<27-18,PETER CONNELLY>We made some adjustments.

935
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,630
<27-19,CASTLE>不过  这场景应该似曾相识吧
<27-19,CASTLE>And yet, it has an oddly familiar ring to it.

936
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,350
<27-20,BECKETT>你的工作之一就是读别人的剧本
<27-20,BECKETT>Reading other people's scripts is a part of your job,

937
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,620
<27-21,REESE HARMON>-是吧  -你到底想说我什么
<27-21,REESE HARMON>- isn't it? - What are you accusing me of?

938
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,060
<27-22,CASTLE>没看这场戏吗  想要成为一名编剧
<27-22,CASTLE>Did you not see the scene? If you're going to be a writer,

939
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,620
<27-22,CASTLE>你要更能听懂潜台词才行
<27-22,CASTLE>you have to have a better grasp of subtext.

940
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,330
<27-22,CASTLE>我...
<27-22,CASTLE>Look, I--I'm...

941
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,840
<27-23,REESE HARMON>我可能是借用了别人的剧本
<27-23,REESE HARMON>I might have mixed up some of the scripts,

942
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,220
<27-23,REESE HARMON>但是莎拉死的那晚
<27-23,REESE HARMON>but I was at the fellowship mixer

943
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,660
<27-23,REESE HARMON>我在奖学金联谊会上
<27-23,REESE HARMON>the night that Sarah died.

944
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,040
<27-24,CASTLE>没人记得晚上8点以后见过你
<27-24,CASTLE>Nobody there remembers seeing you after 8:00 P.M.

945
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,230
<27-24,CASTLE>里斯  凶手用斧子砍死了莎拉
<27-24,CASTLE>Sarah was killed with an ax, reese.

946
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,320
<27-25,BECKETT>不管是谁杀的  凶手的身上鞋上
<27-25,BECKETT>Whoever killed her got blood on their clothes

947
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,840
<27-25,BECKETT>肯定会沾上血迹
<27-25,BECKETT>and on their shoes.

948
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,840
<27-25,BECKETT>有些血迹肉眼看不到
<27-25,BECKETT>Some of it invisible to the naked eye,

949
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,730
<27-25,BECKETT>但是不管你怎么洗它
<27-25,BECKETT>but it doesn't matter how much you try to wash it,

950
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,950
<27-25,BECKETT>还是洗不掉
<27-25,BECKETT>it's still there.

951
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,740
<27-25,BECKETT>我已经派警员到你公寓去了
<27-25,BECKETT>I have officers at your apartment.

952
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,110
<27-26,REESE HARMON>你们根本不知道
<27-26,REESE HARMON>You have no idea

953
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,490
<27-26,REESE HARMON>我为她做了多少事
<27-26,REESE HARMON>what I did for her.

954
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,170
<27-26,REESE HARMON>给她照顾宠物狗
<27-26,REESE HARMON>Picking up her dogs,

955
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,240
<27-26,REESE HARMON>给她取干洗的衣服
<27-26,REESE HARMON>picking up her dry cleaning,

956
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,800
<27-26,REESE HARMON>不管深夜还是周末都要上班
<27-26,REESE HARMON>The late nights, the weekends,

957
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,130
<27-26,REESE HARMON>还没有假期
<27-26,REESE HARMON>no vacation.

958
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,860
<27-26,REESE HARMON>你有本事试试在这么忙的情况下写个剧本啊
<27-26,REESE HARMON>You try writing a script with all of that going on.

959
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,220
<27-26,REESE HARMON>我累死累活
<27-26,REESE HARMON>I worked too hard

960
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,250
<27-26,REESE HARMON>我不能放弃这个机会啊
<27-26,REESE HARMON>to let it end that way.

961
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,000
<27-26,REESE HARMON>那个机会是我应得的
<27-26,REESE HARMON>I deserved that opportunity,

962
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,890
<27-26,REESE HARMON>我不能让她把这个机会夺走
<27-26,REESE HARMON>and I could not let her take that away from me.

963
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,650
<27-27,CASTLE>这个机会从一开始就不属于你
<27-27,CASTLE>It was never yours to begin with.

964
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,100
<28-1,ESPOSITO>杀莎拉就为了剽窃不被发现吗
<28-1,ESPOSITO>Killing Sarah to keep a lid on her plagiarism?

965
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,640
<28-2,BECKETT>-真是残忍啊  -动机倒是很常见
<28-2,BECKETT>- That's cold. - And pretty ordinary as far as motives go.

966
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,850
<28-3,RYAN>不想脚踏实地工作
<28-3,RYAN>She didn't want to put in the work,

967
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,360
<28-4,CASTLE>-光想走捷径  -写作路上无捷径
<28-4,CASTLE>- so she took a shortcut. - There are no shortcuts in writing.

968
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,930
<28-5,RYAN>是没有  但去咱们最喜欢的酒吧可以抄近路哦
<28-5,RYAN>Nope, but there is to our favorite bar.

969
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,290
<28-5,RYAN>我发现一条去"老地方"的新路线
<28-5,RYAN>I found a new route that'll get us

970
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,120
<28-5,RYAN>8分钟就能到
<28-5,RYAN>to the Old Haunt in eight minutes.

971
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,800
<28-5,RYAN>想喝啤酒吗  走吧  我认识老板
<28-5,RYAN>You up for a beer? Come on. I know the owner.

972
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,710
<28-6,ESPOSITO>行  我去  那你呢  卡塞尔
<28-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'm down, bro. How 'bout you, Castle?

973
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,220
<28-7,BECKETT>随后就到
<28-7,BECKETT>Right behind you.

974
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,630
<28-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<28-8,BECKETT>What?

975
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,610
<28-9,CASTLE>给你份礼物
<28-9,CASTLE>Got you a present.

976
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,500
<28-10,BECKETT>《诱惑巷》卡司的签名照
<28-10,BECKETT>A signed cast photo from "Temptation Lane."

977
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,850
<28-10,BECKETT>你从哪儿弄的
<28-10,BECKETT>How did you even get this?

978
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,760
<28-11,CASTLE>我认识有门路的人
<28-11,CASTLE>I know people who know people.

979
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,330
<28-11,CASTLE>好吧
<28-11,CASTLE>Okay.

980
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,310
<28-12,BECKETT>我九岁的时候
<28-12,BECKETT>I was 9,

981
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,400
<28-12,BECKETT>扁桃体被摘除了
<28-12,BECKETT>and I had to get my tonsils taken out,

982
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,460
<28-12,BECKETT>当时很痛苦
<28-12,BECKETT>and I was miserable.

983
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,650
<28-12,BECKETT>所以妈妈就请假
<28-12,BECKETT>and so my mom took time off of work

984
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,440
<28-12,BECKETT>留在家陪我
<28-12,BECKETT>and... stayed with me

985
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,730
<28-12,BECKETT>她拥着我坐在沙发上看电视
<28-12,BECKETT>and cuddled up in front of the TV on the couch,

986
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,160
<28-12,BECKETT>当时看的就是《诱惑巷》
<28-12,BECKETT>and we would watch episodes of "Temptation Lane."

987
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,890
<28-12,BECKETT>所以每次看这部剧  总是...
<28-12,BECKETT>So every time I see it now, it just--

988
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,220
<28-12,BECKETT>总会让我觉得温馨  觉得安全
<28-12,BECKETT>it makes me feel like home and...safe.

989
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,540
<28-12,BECKETT>说完了  开始点评吧
<28-12,BECKETT>So there you go. Judge away.

991
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,640
<28-13,CASTLE>我的DVR
<28-13,CASTLE>My DVR...

993
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,200
<28-13,CASTLE>会把你的DVR衬托的跟"杰作剧场"一样
<28-13,CASTLE>would make yours look like "Masterpiece theatre."

994
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,640
<28-13,CASTLE>但还是很高兴能知道这些你的故事
<28-13,CASTLE>But I am glad to know this about you.

996
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,860
<28-14,CASTLE>那我先走了
<28-14,CASTLE>I'll leave you to it.

997
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,050
<28-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  谢谢你送的照片
<28-15,BECKETT>Hey, Castle. Thank you for the photo.

998
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,710
<28-16,CASTLE>回见
<28-16,CASTLE>I'll see you.

999
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,030
<28-17,BECKETT>你好
<28-17,BECKETT>Hey.

1000
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,980
<29-1,LANCE HASTINGS>过了这么多年
<29-1,LANCE HASTINGS>After all these years,

1001
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,620
<29-1,LANCE HASTINGS>很多次本可以拥你入怀
<29-1,LANCE HASTINGS>all the times I could've been holding you in my arms...

1002
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,120
<29-2,MARTHA>那就不要浪费时间说话了
<29-2,MARTHA>Then let's not waste more time with words.

1003
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,450
<29-2,MARTHA>让我们的双唇来倾诉情思
<29-2,MARTHA>let's just let our lips do the talking.

1004
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,840
<29-3,CASTLE>你们俩又在对台词吗
<29-3,CASTLE>You two running lines again?

1005
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,110
<29-4,MARTHA>噢  不是
<29-4,MARTHA>Oh. Well, no, no.

1006
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,340
<29-4,MARTHA>我们只是...  聊天而已
<29-4,MARTHA>We were just, uh... you know, talking.

1007
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,720
<29-6,CASTLE>我得...
<29-6,CASTLE>Um... I'm gonna--

1008
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,980
<29-6,CASTLE>我要...
<29-6,CASTLE>I'll just--I'll...

1009
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,590
<29-6,CASTLE>去...
<29-6,CASTLE>go to the...
