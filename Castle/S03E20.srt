<5-11,RYAN>Come on. Let me show you my place, huh?

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,500
<1-1,GINGER>我得发到微薄上
<1-1,GINGER>Oh! I gotta tweet this.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,390
<1-1,GINGER>谁都不会相信我竟然和...
<1-1,GINGER>No one will believe I'm with...

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,760
<1-1,GINGER>美味尼克在一起
<1-1,GINGER>the Terrific Nick.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,370
<1-1,GINGER>我是"正宗"尼克
<1-1,GINGER>Mm. Uh, "Authentic" Nick.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,180
<1-2,GINGER>别叫成"美味"
<1-2,GINGER>Not "Terrific", Okay?

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,190
<1-2,GINGER>我是说...我们才是最棒的
<1-2,GINGER>I mean, uh... we're the best.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,530
<1-2,GINGER>当然了
<1-2,GINGER>I'll bet.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,460
<1-2,GINGER>闻起来真香
<1-2,GINGER>And it smells so good.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,740
<1-2,GINGER>确实...挺香
<1-2,GINGER>It does... smell good.

11
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,320
<1-2,GINGER>有人在吗
<1-2,GINGER>Somebody here?

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,010
<1-3,GINGER>老爸
<1-3,GINGER>Dad?

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,100
<1-3,GINGER>像烤排骨  是烤肉披萨吗
<1-3,GINGER>It smells like ribs. Is that barbecue pizza?

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,890
<1-3,GINGER>我们不做烤肉披萨
<1-3,GINGER>No, we don't do barbecue pizza, all right?

15
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-3,GINGER>好味尼克那种冒牌店才做
<1-3,GINGER>That's for the hacks like Terrific Nick.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,810
<2-1,CASTLE>脆脆的
<2-1,CASTLE>Ooh, nice and crispy.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,490
<2-1,CASTLE>你最爱吃了
<2-1,CASTLE>Just the way you like it.

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,880
<2-2,ALEXIS>你吃吧  我不饿
<2-2,ALEXIS>You eat it. I'm not hungry.

19
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,500
<2-3,CASTLE>你可从来不拒绝火鸡培根
<2-3,CASTLE>You've never said no to turkey bacon.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:05,960
<2-3,CASTLE>怎么了
<2-3,CASTLE>What's wrong?

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,750
<2-4,ALEXIS>-没事  -肯定有事
<2-4,ALEXIS>- Nothing. - Something.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,470
<2-6,CASTLE>别逼我钳你
<2-6,CASTLE>Don't make me tong you.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,370
<2-7,CASTLE>笑都不笑  看来很严重
<2-7,CASTLE>Not even a smile. Must be serious.

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,350
<2-8,ALEXIS>是劳伦的生日派对  我不去了
<2-8,ALEXIS>It's Lauren's birthday party. I'm not going.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,460
<2-9,CASTLE>什么  你这几周一直在说
<2-9,CASTLE>What? You been talking about that party for weeks.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,160
<2-9,CASTLE>"肯定是本世纪最棒的派对"
<2-9,CASTLE>"It's gonna be the party of the century."

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,360
<2-10,ALEXIS>昨天劳伦找到我
<2-10,ALEXIS>Yesterday Lauren came up to me,

28
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,170
<2-10,ALEXIS>当着所有人的面撤回了对我的邀请
<2-10,ALEXIS>and in front of everybody, told me I was disinvited.

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,670
<2-10,ALEXIS>太丢脸了
<2-10,ALEXIS>It was humiliating.

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,250
<2-11,CASTLE>劳伦为什么这么做
<2-11,CASTLE>Why would Lauren do something like that?

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,630
<2-11,CASTLE>她可是你最好的朋友
<2-11,CASTLE>She's one of your best friends.

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,200
<2-12,ALEXIS>她曾经是
<2-12,ALEXIS>She was one of my best friends.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,140
<2-12,ALEXIS>我也不知道她为什么要那么做
<2-12,ALEXIS>I have no idea why she's acting like this,

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,900
<2-12,ALEXIS>她拒绝跟我谈  阿什利和其他人
<2-12,ALEXIS>And she refuses to talk to me, and Ashley's still invited,

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,430
<2-12,ALEXIS>都还在被邀请之列
<2-12,ALEXIS>and so is everyone else.

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,700
<2-12,ALEXIS>就好像我是社交怪胎一样
<2-12,ALEXIS>And it's like I'm a social leper.

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,230
<2-13,CASTLE>你不去阿什利也不会去的
<2-13,CASTLE>Well, Ashley's not gonna go without you.

38
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,210
<2-14,ALEXIS>不能因为我被孤立而连累他
<2-14,ALEXIS>Just because I have leprosy doesn't mean he should.

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,100
<2-15,CASTLE>我觉得你该开一个派对跟她叫板
<2-15,CASTLE>Well, I think you should throw a rival party

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,830
<2-15,CASTLE>把你的朋友都邀请来
<2-15,CASTLE>and invite all your friends to that one instead.

41
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,220
<2-16,ALEXIS>她今晚举行派对  还有乐队现场演奏
<2-16,ALEXIS>The party's tonight, and she has a live band performing.

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,860
<2-16,ALEXIS>我比不上她的
<2-16,ALEXIS>I can't compete with that.

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,350
<2-17,CASTLE>那我给劳伦妈妈打电话  我...
<2-17,CASTLE>Well, then I'll call Lauren's mom, and I'll--

44
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,100
<2-18,ALEXIS>你开玩笑吧
<2-18,ALEXIS>You're joking, right?

45
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,830
<2-18,ALEXIS>那我就成了被孤立的告密者了
<2-18,ALEXIS>What, so I can be a leper and a tattletale?

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
<2-18,ALEXIS>我17岁了  我自己能处理好
<2-18,ALEXIS>I'm 17. I can deal with this on my own.

47
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,650
<3-1,CASTLE>只是...我的每一丝直觉
<3-1,CASTLE>It's just... every instinct in my body

48
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,200
<3-1,CASTLE>都在暗示我  我得保护她
<3-1,CASTLE>is telling me to protect her.

49
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,810
<3-2,BECKETT>我明白  不过涉及到青少年的事
<3-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but when it comes to teenagers,

50
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,480
<3-2,BECKETT>连你的保护不了她  再说阿丽克西斯
<3-2,BECKETT>not even you can protect her. Alexis is gonna have to deal

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,940
<3-2,BECKETT>终生都要与小人打交道
<3-2,BECKETT>with backstabbers her whole life.

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,420
<3-2,BECKETT>她很聪明  完全能解决好
<3-2,BECKETT>But she's intelligent enough to rise above all of that.

53
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,230
<3-3,CASTLE>我说不准  她看上去已经准备好要杀人了
<3-3,CASTLE>I don't know. She looked like she was ready to commit murder.

54
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,740
<3-4,BECKETT>说起谋杀
<3-4,BECKETT>Speaking of murder.

55
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,000
<3-4,BECKETT>我以为东边的好味尼克披萨店才是一流的
<3-4,BECKETT>I thought Terrific Nick's on the east side was number one.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,290
<4-1,BECKETT>不  那家叫正宗好味尼克披萨店
<4-1,BECKETT>Uh, no, that's Authentic Terrific Nick's.

57
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,570
<4-2,CASTLE>-这家只叫正宗尼克  -这里不是好味
<4-2,CASTLE>- This is just Authentic Nick's. - This isn't Terrific?

58
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,610
<4-3,BECKETT>只是正宗而已  这也不是好味正宗尼克披萨店
<4-3,BECKETT>No, just Authentic. It's also not Terrific Authentic Nick's,

59
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,600
<4-4,CASTLE>-对面才是  -到底有什么差别
<4-4,CASTLE>- But that's across the street. - What's the difference?

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,160
<4-5,BECKETT>差别在于这家的烤箱烤尸体
<4-5,BECKETT>The difference is, this one has a dead body in the oven.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,770
<4-6,LANIE>好...吧
<4-6,LANIE>O-kay.

62
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,810
<4-7,BECKETT>-这可真是...  -烤得挺好
<4-7,BECKETT>- That is really... - Well-done.

63
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,290
<4-8,CASTLE>再过几个小时也许能烤好
<4-8,CASTLE>Another couple of hours, maybe,

64
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,370
<4-9,LANIE>不过我还挺走运  他只是半熟
<4-9,LANIE>but luckily for me, he's only half-baked.

65
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,570
<4-10,LANIE>男性  四十多岁  我只能判断出这些
<4-10,LANIE>Male, mid-40s, that's about as much I.D. as I can give you.

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,430
<4-10,LANIE>根据烤箱设置和尸体内部温度
<4-10,LANIE>Based on the oven setting and the body's core temperature,

67
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,310
<4-10,LANIE>我推断他凌晨两点就被放进去了
<4-10,LANIE>I'd say he went in no sooner than 2:00 a.m.

68
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,490
<4-11,BECKETT>我有点不敢问  死因是...
<4-11,BECKETT>I'm afraid to ask. Cause of death?

69
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,800
<4-12,LANIE>不是烤死的  胸口穿透性刺伤
<4-12,LANIE>It wasn't the oven. The stab wound through the chest

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,230
<4-12,LANIE>表明他被放入时已经死亡
<4-12,LANIE>says he was dead when he went in.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,610
<4-13,ESPOSITO>没有强行闯入的痕迹
<4-13,ESPOSITO>No sign of forced entry.

72
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,730
<4-13,ESPOSITO>不过我们还是在检测门把手上的指纹
<4-13,ESPOSITO>But we're running the prints on the door handle just the same.

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,630
<4-14,BECKETT>好的  烤箱上的也检测下
<4-14,BECKETT>All right. Run 'em on the oven as well.

74
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,040
<4-14,BECKETT>-谁发现的  -小尼克
<4-14,BECKETT>- Who found him? - Uh, Nick Jr.

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,330
<4-16,ESPOSITO>正宗家的  不是好味家的
<4-16,ESPOSITO>Authentic, not Terrific.

76
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,930
<4-16,ESPOSITO>不  我不知道他是谁
<4-16,ESPOSITO>No. I got no idea who he is.

77
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,080
<4-17,BECKETT>我打开烤箱  他就在里面了
<4-17,BECKETT>I mean, I open up the oven, and bam--there he is.

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,750
<4-17,BECKETT>昨晚最后待在这里的是谁
<4-17,BECKETT>And who were the last ones here last night?

79
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,450
<4-17,BECKETT>我爸和我
<4-17,BECKETT>My dad and me.

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,170
<4-17,BECKETT>我们11点左右打烊
<4-17,BECKETT>We closed around 11:00,

81
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,640
<4-17,BECKETT>然后我去了凯达吧
<4-17,BECKETT>And then I hit up the Kaydar Lounge,

82
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,420
<4-17,BECKETT>遇上一位女士  我们就一起回到这儿
<4-17,BECKETT>met up with a lady friend, and then we came back here

83
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,970
<17-1,BECKETT>想..."尝片儿披萨"
<17-1,BECKETT>to, uh... have a slice.

84
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,870
<17-2,CASTLE>那是几点
<17-2,CASTLE>And when was that?

85
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,170
<17-3,BECKETT>不确定  4点半吧
<17-3,BECKETT>I don't know. 4:30.

86
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,310
<17-4,CASTLE>那位女士在哪儿
<17-4,CASTLE>Where's your lady friend now?

87
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,390
<17-5,BECKETT>她吐个不停
<17-5,BECKETT>She was kinda throwing up a lot,

88
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,760
<13-3,BECKETT>医护人员就把她带走了
<13-3,BECKETT>so the paramedics had to take her in.

89
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,860
<13-4,RYAN>不过我有她号码
<13-4,RYAN>Oh, but I kept her number.

90
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,580
<4-17,BECKETT>我觉得你们不会再碰面了
<4-17,BECKETT>I-I don't think there's gonna be a second date.

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,840
<4-18,BECKETT>-也对  -抱歉
<4-18,BECKETT>- Yeah, you're right. - I'm sorry.

92
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,980
<4-19,CASTLE>我需要你提供一份雇员和送餐人员的
<4-19,CASTLE>I'm gonna need a list of all of your employees

93
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,760
<4-20,CASTLE>-详细名单  -你该不会
<4-20,CASTLE>- and delivery staff. - You don't

94
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,630
<4-21,BECKETT>觉得烤箱里是我们的伙计吧
<4-21,BECKETT>think it was one of our guys in the oven, do you?

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
<4-22,BECKETT>等你给我名单  我就开始致电询问
<4-22,BECKETT>As soon as you get me that list, I'll start making phone calls.

96
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,550
<4-23,RALPH CARBONE>我简直不能相信
<4-23,RALPH CARBONE>Ohh. I don't believe this.

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,670
<4-23,RALPH CARBONE>肯定是开玩笑吧
<4-23,RALPH CARBONE>You gotta be kidding me.

98
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,950
<4-24,CASTLE>老爸  这些人是警察
<4-24,CASTLE>Dad, these are the cops.

99
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,730
<4-24,CASTLE>你肯定是正宗尼克
<4-24,CASTLE>You must be Authentic Nick.

100
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,970
<4-25,RALPH CARBONE>-独一无二  -尼克
<4-25,RALPH CARBONE>- The one and only. - Nick?

101
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,020
<4-26,BECKETT>名单上业主叫拉尔夫·卡波
<4-26,BECKETT>I have the proprietor listed as Ralph Carbone.

102

<4-27,RALPH CARBONE>就是我  人人都叫我尼克
<4-27,RALPH CARBONE>Yeah, that's me. Everybody calls me Nick.

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,790
<4-28,BECKETT>为什么
<4-28,BECKETT>Why?

104
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,550
<4-29,RALPH CARBONE>因为人人都那么叫我
<4-29,RALPH CARBONE>Because that's what everybody calls me.

105

<4-31,RALPH CARBONE>我打赌就是那个混球
<4-31,RALPH CARBONE>I'll bet it was that Jackhole.

111
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,830
<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>后来在街对面开了他自己的破披萨店
<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>his own lousy pizza shop right across the street.

112
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,310
<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>他偷了我的秘方
<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>He stole my friggin' recipes.

<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>肯定是萨尔和另外两个人干的
<4-33,RALPH CARBONE>It's Sal that done this, along with the other two.

119
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,570
<4-39,RALPH CARBONE>他们利用我们的名气  他们都不是真正的尼克
<4-39,RALPH CARBONE>They live off our name, and they're not even real Nicks.

120
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,840
<4-40,CASTLE>-我才是真尼克  -可你真名叫拉尔夫
<4-40,CASTLE>- I'm the only real Nick. - And your real name is Ralph.

<4-42,RALPH CARBONE>现在又做出这等事  还有谁会买我家的披萨
<4-42,RALPH CARBONE>And now this. Who's gonna buy my pizza now, huh?

123
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,800
<4-43,RALPH CARBONE>喂  喂  你高兴了吧  我开不了张了
<4-43,RALPH CARBONE>Hey! Hey! You happy? I'm outta business!

<4-44,BECKETT>卡波先生  你为什么认为
<4-44,BECKETT>Mr. Carbone, what makes you think

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,820
<4-44,BECKETT>这是他们中某人干的
<4-44,BECKETT>that one of them did this?

126
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,970
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>几个星期前  他们其中一个
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>A few weeks ago, one of them

<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>snuck a gallon of soap into my secret sauce.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,230
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>导致我那天卖的披萨都被退回来了
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>Cost me a whole day of returned pies.

129
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,330
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>听着  我或许报复过  或许没有
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>Now look, uh, I may or may not have retaliated,

130
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,320
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>假设说我报复了
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>but if I did,

131
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,360
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>他们把一具死尸放在我的烤箱里
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>them putting a cadaver in my oven

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,590
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>那不就是  他们反报复吗
<4-45,RALPH CARBONE>that's, uh, them retaliating back.

133
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,610
<4-46,BECKETT>卡波先生  那不是一具死尸
<4-46,BECKETT>Mr. Carbone, that's not a cadaver.

134
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,360
<4-46,BECKETT>什么意思  那是  他们从
<4-46,BECKETT>What do you mean? It's a--they brought--

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,460
<4-47,RALPH CARBONE>他们从医学院搞来的
<4-47,RALPH CARBONE>they--they got this from some medical school.

136
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,080
<4-48,BECKETT>不  这不是恶作剧  是谋杀案
<4-48,BECKETT>No, this isn't a prank. This is murder.

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,220
<5-1,ESPOSITO>我们核查了所有员工
<5-1,ESPOSITO>We got through to all their employees.

<5-2,BECKETT>有没有可能弄清死者身份
<5-2,BECKETT>what are the chances of getting an I.D.?

140
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,820
<5-3,LANIE>根据指纹判断我看没戏  也许要等
<5-3,LANIE>I'm not hopeful on fingerprints. We may have to wait

141
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,050
<5-3,LANIE>失踪人口报告
<5-3,LANIE>for a missing persons report

<5-4,ESPOSITO>- and dental records.  - We also started a canvass

143

<5-4,ESPOSITO>看有没有人昨晚看到了什么
<5-4,ESPOSITO>to see if anybody saw anything last night.

144
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,580
<5-5,BECKETT>好  我们找所有员工录口供
<5-5,BECKETT>All right, let's get statements off all the employees,

145
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,810
<5-5,BECKETT>尤其是那些有钥匙的人
<5-5,BECKETT>especially the ones with keys.

146
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,240
<5-5,BECKETT>看他们昨晚在做什么
<5-5,BECKETT>I'd like to know what they were doing last night.

147
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,760
<5-6,CASTLE>不需要调查一下其他几个披萨店吗
<5-6,CASTLE>Shouldn't we look into the other Nick's, too?

148
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,580
<5-7,ESPOSITO>拜托  老兄  你不会真以为
<5-7,ESPOSITO>Come on, bro. You don't really think

149
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,320
<5-7,ESPOSITO>这是披萨店之间的竞争导致的吧
<5-7,ESPOSITO>this is about some kind of pizza rivalry, do you?

150
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,210
<5-8,CASTLE>竞争纽约第一的位子  肯定是拼得头破血流啊
<5-8,CASTLE>Competition to be the best in New York, clear animosity?

151
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,860
<5-8,CASTLE>卡波说他们之前就闯进来过
<5-8,CASTLE>Carbone said they'd broken in before.

152
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,990
<5-8,CASTLE>如果要调查所有能进入这里的人
<5-8,CASTLE>If we are looking into everyone with access,

153
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,140
<5-8,CASTLE>他们就不该被排除在外
<5-8,CASTLE>we should look into them as well.

154
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,160
<5-9,RYAN>他说的对
<5-9,RYAN>He's right, you know?

155
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,390
<5-9,RYAN>在这里  披萨行内竞争很激烈
<5-9,RYAN>Pizza's serious business in this town.

156
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,160
<5-10,BECKETT>好吧  棒极了  就派你去吧
<5-10,BECKETT>All right. Great. You talk to them.

157

<5-11,RYAN>等等  我
<5-11,RYAN>Wait. Me?

<5-11,RYAN>不行  我  饶了我吧
<5-11,RYAN>No, I... come on.

159
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,040
<6-1,CASTLE>你必须承认  用披萨烤箱
<6-1,CASTLE>You know, you have to admit, a pizza oven--

160
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,840
<6-1,CASTLE>是个处理尸体极高明的手法
<6-1,CASTLE>very clever way to get rid of a body.

161
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,900
<6-1,CASTLE>在《消失在黄昏》里  我让精神病律师助理
<6-1,CASTLE>In "At Dusk We Die," I had my psychotic paralegal

162
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,310
<6-1,CASTLE>杀了她的虐待狂老板  把尸体放在陶器窖里
<6-1,CASTLE>kill her abusive boss and put him in a pottery kiln.

163
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,630
<6-1,CASTLE>几个小时之后  他就化为灰烬了
<6-1,CASTLE>He was reduced to ashes in a matter of hours.

164
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,640
<6-1,CASTLE>当然  你已经知道这个情节了  是吧
<6-1,CASTLE>Of course, you already know this, don't you?

165
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,830
<6-2,BECKETT>或许凶手正是这么打算的
<6-2,BECKETT>That's probably what our killer planned on doing

166
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,330
<6-2,BECKETT>-直到小尼克出现  -我没听错吧
<6-2,BECKETT>- until Nick Jr. showed up.  - Did I hear right?

167
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,740
<6-3,MONTGOMERY>你们在美味尼克披萨店的烤箱里发现了一具尸体
<6-3,MONTGOMERY>You found a body in the oven at Terrific Nick's?

168
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,160
<6-4,BECKETT>-正宗尼克披萨店  -正宗尼克披萨店

<6-5,MONGTOMERY>感谢上帝  我老婆很喜欢美味尼克披萨店
<6-5,MONGTOMERY>Oh, thank God. My wife loves Terrific Nick's.

170
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,470
<6-5,MONGTOMERY>我可不想告诉她
<6-5,MONGTOMERY>I didn't have the heart

171
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,230
<6-5,MONGTOMERY>现在披萨都是尸体口味的
<6-5,MONGTOMERY>to tell her it now came in full-bodied flavor.

173
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,160
<6-6,CASTLE>说得好  我喜欢
<6-6,CASTLE>Oh, I liked it .. I liked it.

174
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,100
<6-7,RYAN>我们调查了所有正宗尼克披萨店的员工
<6-7,RYAN>So we ran through all of Authentic Nick's employees.

175
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
<6-7,RYAN>他们都没嫌疑  但我在另几家店
<6-7,RYAN>They alibied out, but I did find a bunch of stuff

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,940
<6-8,BECKETT>-找到一些线索  -刑事申诉
<6-8,BECKETT>- on the other Nick's.  - Criminal complaints?

177
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,010
<6-9,RYAN>没错  过去这几年他们反复申诉
<6-9,RYAN>Yeah, dozens of them filed back and forth between

178
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,090
<6-9,RYAN>几家披萨店之间的所做所为
<6-9,RYAN>all the Nick's over the years--

186
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,760
<6-13,BECKETT>对手间的恶作剧升级为谋杀了吗
<6-13,BECKETT>from frat pranks to murder?

188
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,060
<7-1,LANIE>如我所料
<7-1,LANIE>As expected,

<7-11,BECKETT>Yeah, it wasn't at the crime scene, either.

209
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,480
<7-12,LANIE>那是他的钱包
<7-12,LANIE>And that's his wallet.

211
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,520
<7-13,BECKETT>驾照  都化掉了
<7-13,BECKETT>driver's license-- that's all melted.

212
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,070
<7-13,BECKETT>女朋友  还是妻子
<7-13,BECKETT>Girlfriend, wife?

213
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,520
<7-14,LANIE>据记录伯恩斯离婚了  没有其他亲属
<7-14,LANIE>Burns is listed as divorced, no next of kin.

214
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,000
<7-15,CASTLE>他是个战地记者  调查记者
<7-15,CASTLE>He was a war correspondent, an investigative reporter.

215
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,400
<7-15,CASTLE>怎么会被塞进了披萨烤箱呢
<7-15,CASTLE>What was he doing in a pizza oven?

216
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,670
<7-16,BECKETT>也许他的编辑知道
<7-16,BECKETT>Maybe his editor knows.

217
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,330
<8-1,WALT SHAW>我们是朋友  所以当我升任报纸编辑之后
<8-1,WALT SHAW>We were friends, so when I became editor of the paper,

218
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,420
<8-2,CASTLE>-我首先雇的就是他  -他写的那些故事
<8-2,CASTLE>- he was my first hire.  - The kinds of stories he wrote,

219
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,290
<8-2,CASTLE>一定得罪了不少人
<8-2,CASTLE>he must have stepped on his fair share of toes.

220
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,180
<8-3,WALT SHAW>这几年没有  他已经退出那个圈子好久了
<8-3,WALT SHAW>Not for years. He'd been out of the game for a while.

221
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,260
<8-4,BECKETT>为什么
<8-4,BECKETT>Why is that?

<8-5,WALT SHAW>She was 10. After that, he finally gave in

224
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,830
<8-5,WALT SHAW>不能自拔
<8-5,WALT SHAW>to his love affair with the bottle.

225
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,750
<8-6,BECKETT>我们看到他仍在你们的员工名单之列
<8-6,BECKETT>We see that you still had him on the payroll.

<8-7,WALT SHAW>他不时为生活版块
<8-7,WALT SHAW>He did the occasional human interest story

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,090
<8-7,WALT SHAW>写一些关于民生的报道
<8-7,WALT SHAW>for our lifestyles section.

228
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,280
<8-7,WALT SHAW>有点浪费他的才能  但能支付他的租金
<8-7,WALT SHAW>A waste of his talent, but it let him make rent,

<9-1,BECKETT>and let's also run bagrground checks on all their employees.

249
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,390
<9-2,CASTLE>却因为写一篇披萨的报道而被杀
<9-2,CASTLE>to be killed doing a puff piece on pizza?

250
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,250
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这就像做警察一样  兄弟
<9-3,ESPOSITO>It's like being a cop, bro.

251
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,020
<9-3,ESPOSITO>你在和一群武装帮派的火拼中幸免
<9-3,ESPOSITO>You survive a firefight with a dozen armed gangbangers

252
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,470
<9-3,ESPOSITO>结果却被车撞死了或是在长岛高速上开超速罚单
<9-3,ESPOSITO>only to be hit by a car or write a speed ticket on the LIE.

253

<9-4,RYAN>I ran a trace on Burns' missing phone.

<9-4,RYAN>It's either out of battery or turned off.

255
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,890
<9-5,BECKETT>好  查一下他的通话记录和消费记录
<9-5,BECKETT>All right, run LUDs and financials.

<9-7,CASTLE>某个比谁的披萨最好更重要的事
<9-7,CASTLE>something bigger than who has the best pizza.

260
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,820
<9-8,BECKETT>伯恩斯可能把他写的报道的笔记
<9-8,BECKETT>You know, Burns probably had notes

261
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,270
<9-8,BECKETT>和草稿放在了他的公寓里
<9-8,BECKETT>and drafts of his story in his apartment.

262
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,880
<9-8,BECKETT>如果我们找到了它们  我们就能
<9-8,BECKETT>If we can find them, we can figure out

<9-8,BECKETT>- what he was up to last night. - Let's go.

<10-1,ESPOSITO>门曾被踹开过
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Door's been kicked open.

<10-3,BECKETT>这地方被翻得乱七八糟
<10-3,BECKETT>This place is trashed.

267
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,080
<10-4,ESPOSITO>我去问问邻居
<10-4,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna check with the neighbors,

268
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
<10-5,BECKETT>-看看有没有人听到什么动静  -好的
<10-5,BECKETT>- see if anybody heard anything. - Okay.

<10-6,CASTLE>这些抽屉都掏空了
<10-6,CASTLE>These drawers have been emptied.

270
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,080
<10-6,CASTLE>如果这里曾经装着文件或是笔记
<10-6,CASTLE>If there were files or notes,

271
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,920
<10-6,CASTLE>现在它们全被拿走了
<10-6,CASTLE>they're gone now.

272
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,180
<10-7,BECKETT>不管他在报道什么
<10-7,BECKETT>Well, whatever he was working on,

273
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,960
<10-7,BECKETT>有人不希望我们找到它
<10-7,BECKETT>someone didn't want us to find it.

274
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,670
<10-8,BECKETT>你还好吗
<10-8,BECKETT>You okay?

275
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,110

<10-9,CASTLE>Yeah. No, yeah.

276
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,150
<10-9,CASTLE>我觉得我以前见过她
<10-9,CASTLE>Um, I think I met her.

277
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,300
<10-9,CASTLE>我去参加他的图书签售会的时候  那本
<10-9,CASTLE>I went to a book signing of his, the one he did on the, uh,

278
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,380
<10-9,CASTLE>关于萨拉热窝狙击手的书
<10-9,CASTLE>Sarajevo Snipers.

279
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,990
<10-9,CASTLE>她...
<10-9,CASTLE>She was...

280
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,780
<10-9,CASTLE>他签售的时候她就在旁边
<10-9,CASTLE>coloring next to him while he was signing books.

281
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,080
<10-10,BECKETT>他肯定是个不错的作家  能让你屈尊排队
<10-10,BECKETT>He must have been a good writer for you to stand in line.

282
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,280
<10-11,CASTLE>没错  他的确是
<10-11,CASTLE>Yeah. He was.

283
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,320
<10-12,BECKETT>走吧  我们叫鉴证组过来
<10-12,BECKETT>Come on. Let's go get C.S.U.

284
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,830
<10-12,BECKETT>我发现了一些奇怪的事
<10-12,BECKETT>Hey. I got something weird.

285
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,820
<10-13,ESPOSITO>伯恩斯的邻居  她说她从上周起替他
<10-13,ESPOSITO>Burns' neighbor, she says she's been holding

286
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,410
<10-13,ESPOSITO>接收他的信件  显然伯恩斯告诉她
<10-13,ESPOSITO>his mail for the last week. Apparently Burns told her

287
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,810
<10-13,ESPOSITO>他要出国一段时间
<10-13,ESPOSITO>he was going out of the country for a while.

288
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,680
<10-14,CASTLE>出国吗  我们知道他一直在这儿
<10-14,CASTLE>Out of the country? We know he's been here.

289
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,230
<10-15,BECKETT>当你不希望别人找你时
<10-15,BECKETT>You know, that's the kind of lie that you tell people

290
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,700
<10-15,BECKETT>你就会撒这种谎
<10-15,BECKETT>when you don't want anyone looking for you.

291
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,920
<10-16,CASTLE>如果他在别的地方待过
<10-16,CASTLE>And if he's been staying somewhere else,

292
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,490
<10-16,CASTLE>我们还有找到他的笔记的可能
<10-16,CASTLE>there's a chance we could still find his notes.

293
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,680
<10-17,BECKETT>我联系一下他的主编
<10-17,BECKETT>I'm gonna to get ahold of his editor,

294
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,050
<10-17,BECKETT>看看他知不知道他可能在哪待过
<10-17,BECKETT>find out where he might have been staying.

295
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,210
<10-18,ESPOSITO>一篇关于披萨的报道怎么会让人东躲西藏
<10-18,ESPOSITO>How does a story about pizza send somebody into hiding?

296
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,520
<10-19,BECKETT>或导致他被杀  贝克特
<10-19,BECKETT>Or get them killed? Beckett.

297
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,960

<10-20,RYAN>披萨店后门把手被擦得很干净
<10-20,RYAN>The back doorknob of the pizza shop was wiped clean,

299
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,450
<10-20,RYAN>但他们发现披萨烤箱上布满了尼克的指纹
<10-20,RYAN>but they did find Nick's prints all over the pizza oven.

300
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,140
<10-21,BECKETT>这可以预料到  他在那儿工作
<10-21,BECKETT>Well, that's to be expected. I mean, he worked there.

301
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,600
<10-22,RYAN>不是正宗尼克的指纹   这些指纹
<10-22,RYAN>Not Authentic Nick. These prints belong to

302
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,470
<10-22,RYAN>是他街对面的邻居
<10-22,RYAN>his neighbor across the street--

<11-1,BECKETT>so, Nick, or should I say Sal?

<11-2,SAL MALAVOLTA>- Know this guy? - Yeah, I know him.

306
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,650
<11-2,SAL MALAVOLTA>是那个报道我们的故事的记者
<11-2,SAL MALAVOLTA>That's the reporter doing the story on us.

307
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,290
<11-3,BECKETT>你们两个都谈了什么
<11-3,BECKETT>And what did the two of you talk about?

308
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,250
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>谁是真正的尼克
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>Who's the real Nick,

309
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,050
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>我跟他说了我祖父尼克
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>and I told him about my grandpa Nick

310
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,170
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>说他是地道的埃利斯岛移民
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>and how he was an authentic Ellis Island immigrant

312
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,880
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>他搬来莫特街的第一天起
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>who was flipping his terrific dough

313
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,820
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>就开始做美味的比萨了
<11-4,SAL MALAVOLTA>on Mott Street the very day he arrived.

314
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,380
<11-5,CASTLE>还说了什么
<11-5,CASTLE>What else?

315
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,390
<11-6,SAL MALVOLTA>就这些了  为什么这么问
<11-6,SAL MALVOLTA>That's it. Why?

316
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,850
<11-7,CASTLE>只是觉得这算不上什么杀人的理由
<11-7,CASTLE>Just doesn't seem like a good enough reason to kill.

317
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,920
<11-8,SAL MALAVOLTA>杀人
<11-8,SAL MALAVOLTA>Kill?

318
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,470
<11-9,BECKETT>萨尔  我们发现烤箱上沾满了你的指纹
<11-9,BECKETT>We found your fingerprints, sal, all over the oven.

319
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,070
<11-10,SAL MALAVOLTA>你们发现了我的指纹
<11-10,SAL MALAVOLTA>You found my prints?

320
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,850
<11-10,SAL MALAVOLTA>是的
<11-10,SAL MALAVOLTA>Yeah.

321
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,330
<11-11,BECKETT>我们为何不从头说起
<11-11,BECKETT>So why don't we back up?

322
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,610
<11-11,BECKETT>你告诉我们为什么要杀了伯恩斯
<11-11,BECKETT>And you tell us why you killed Burns.

323
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,440
<11-12,CASTLE>-这次你别加那么多"芝士"  -我能解释
<11-12,CASTLE>- And this time, hold the extra cheese. - I-I can explain.

324
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,630
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>我的确去过那儿  但我没杀任何人
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>I was there, but I didn't kill nobody.

325
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,870
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>拉尔夫以为我往他的酱汁里放了肥皂
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>Ralph thought I was soaping his sauce,

326
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,270
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>所以他闯入我的店里
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>so he broke into my place

327
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,590
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>把我电路板上的所有断路器都拿走了
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>and took all the breakers out of my electrical panel.

328
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,080
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>他总是炫耀他的烤箱如何高级
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>Now he's always bragging about his oven,

329
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,770
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>所以我想
<11-13,SAL MALAVOLTA>so I thought I'd--

330
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,650
<11-14,CASTLE>放一具尸体在里面
<11-14,CASTLE>Put a body in it.

331
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,810
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>不  是把它偷走
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>No, steal it.

332
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,340
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>我几天前夜里去了他那儿
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>I went over there a couple nights ago

333
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,940
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>看看我需要什么才能把它偷出来
<11-15,SAL MALAVOLTA>to see what I need to get it out.

334
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,600
<11-16,BECKETT>你在开玩笑吧
<11-16,BECKETT>You're kidding me, right?

335
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,570
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>我昨晚在史丹顿岛区的奥马利酒吧
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>I was in O'Meary's on Staten Island last night,

336
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,760
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>一直待到打烊
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>till closing.

337
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,470
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>那晚是飞镖之夜  我得了第三名
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>Okay? It was dart night. I took third place.

338
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,680
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>你想要调查  那就去调查拉尔夫吧
<11-17,SAL MALAVOLTA>You want to look at somebody, look at Ralph.

339
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,730
<11-18,BECKETT>为什么查拉尔夫
<11-18,BECKETT>Why ralph?

340
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,320
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>你以为他靠卖那些难吃的披萨赚钱吗
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>What do you think, he makes that money with his crappy pizza?

341
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,050
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>他手脚不干净  那才是我离开的原因
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>He's connected. That's why I left.

342
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,040
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>他一心想着为他的朋友洗钱
<11-19,SAL MALAVOLTA>All he cares about is laundering money for his wise guy pals.

343
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,550
<11-20,CASTLE>你不会碰巧跟伯恩斯提过这事儿吧
<11-20,CASTLE>You didn't happen to mention this to Burns, did you?

344
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,270
<11-21,SAM MALAVOLTA>事实上  我提过
<11-21,SAM MALAVOLTA>As a matter of fact, I did.

345
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,340
<12-1,RALPH CARBONE>洗钱吗
<12-1,RALPH CARBONE>Money laundering? Whoa.

346
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,160
<12-2,BECKETT>我们在联邦资料库里查过你
<12-2,BECKETT>We ran you through the federal database.

347
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,720
<12-2,BECKETT>我们知道联邦调查局在90年代的调查
<12-2,BECKETT>We know about the FBI investigation in the '90s

348
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,010
<12-2,BECKETT>还有你与斯伯拉诺犯罪家族的关系
<12-2,BECKETT>and about your connection to the Spolano crime family.

349
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,700
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>和我的关系
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>My connection?

350
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,230
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>他是我隔代的二表亲
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>He's my second cousin once removed.

351
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,520
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>我每过五年会在感恩节和他见上一面
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>I see him at Thanksgiving once every five years.

352
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,630
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>联邦调查局什么也没查出来
<12-3,RALPH CARBONE>And the feds never found anything.

353
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,770
<12-4,BECKETT>他们的确没查出来
<12-4,BECKETT>The feds didn't,

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,540
<12-4,BECKETT>但也许伯恩斯查出来了
<12-4,BECKETT>but maybe burns did.

355
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,900
<12-5,CASTLE>到底发生了什么  拉尔夫
<12-5,CASTLE>So what happened, Ralph?

356
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,040
<12-5,CASTLE>他威胁要揭发你吗
<12-5,CASTLE>Did he threaten to expose you?

357
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,620
<12-5,CASTLE>你本打算让他消失
<12-5,CASTLE>You make him... disappear until your--

358
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,740
<12-5,CASTLE>直到你儿子
<12-5,CASTLE>your kid showed up

359
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,260
<12-5,CASTLE>在那令你自豪的烤箱完成任务前出现了
<12-5,CASTLE>before that oven you're so proud of could finish the job?

360
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,370
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>我靠卖披萨赚钱
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>I make money with my pizza.

361
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,520
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>你想要查我的账簿吗  那就查吧
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>You want to look at my books? Go ahead.

362
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,370
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>你们会和联邦调查局查到的一样
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>You're gonna find exactly the same thing the feds found--

363
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,310
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>什么-也-没有
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>nada, zip, zilch.

364
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,650
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>萨尔让你们俩来调查我的  是吗
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>Sal put yous two up to this, right?

365
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,580
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>之前就是萨尔让联邦调查局
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>Sal's the one brought the feds in

366
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,790
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>来调查我的  想让我关门大吉
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>in the first place, trying to shut me down.

367
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,180
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>你们应该调查一下他
<12-6,RALPH CARBONE>You should be looking at him.

368
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,170
<12-7,BECKETT>萨尔昨晚有不在现场证明
<12-7,BECKETT>Sal had an alibi for last night.

369
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,130
<12-7,BECKETT>你有吗  卡波先生
<12-7,BECKETT>What about you, Mr. Carbone?

370
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,260
<12-8,RALPH CARBONE>我在家躺在床上  你可以问我老婆
<12-8,RALPH CARBONE>I'm at home in bed. You could ask my wife.

371
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,590
<12-8,RALPH CARBONE>那个记者  问我的都是关于披萨的事情
<12-8,RALPH CARBONE>And that reporter, all he asked me about was pizza.

372
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,190
<13-1,CASTLE>那个人肯定犯过什么罪
<13-1,CASTLE>That guy is guilty of something.

373
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,980
<13-2,BECKETT>除非我们有证据
<13-2,BECKETT>Not until we have proof.

374
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,870
<13-3,BECKETT>莱恩  查到我们的被害人昨晚在哪了吗
<13-3,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. Any luck on where our victim was last night?

375
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,620
<13-4,RYAN>我们还在等他的银行的信息
<13-4,RYAN>Well, we're still waiting for info from his bank,

376
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,580
<13-4,RYAN>但我拿到了他的电话单  昨晚没有通话
<13-4,RYAN>but I got his luds. Nothing last night,

377
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,070
<13-4,RYAN>只有前几天和他的主编打过
<13-4,RYAN>And only a few calls to his editor

378
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,980
<13-5,CASTLE>-几个电话  -一个正在写报道的记者吗
<13-5,CASTLE>- in the previous days. - A reporter chasing down a story?

379
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,440
<13-5,CASTLE>不对  应该会打很多电话的
<13-5,CASTLE>No, there should be dozens of calls.

380
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,580
<13-6,BECKETT>也可能他从他住的地方打电话
<13-6,BECKETT>Well, maybe he was making them from wherever he was staying.

381
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,130
<13-6,BECKETT>照片上的女孩查出什么线索没
<13-6,BECKETT>Any leads on the girl in the photo?

<13-7,RYAN>没有  我和他在波特兰的前妻联系过
<13-7,RYAN>No. But I got in touch with Burns' ex in Portland.

383
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,510
<13-8,ESPOSITO>-他们很多年都没见过面了  -重大发现
<13-8,ESPOSITO>- They hadn't seen each other in years. - Yo. Pay dirt.

384
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,920
<13-8,ESPOSITO>我排查了伯恩斯公寓所在的大楼
<13-8,ESPOSITO>I canvassed Burns' building.

385
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,270
<13-8,ESPOSITO>一开始全都说
<13-8,ESPOSITO>At first, it was all,

386
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,290
<13-8,ESPOSITO>"他是个安静的人  他独来独往"
<13-8,ESPOSITO>"He's so quiet. He just keeps to himself."

387
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,110
<13-8,ESPOSITO>但一个刚刚回家的邻居说
<13-8,ESPOSITO>But this other neighbor who just came home

388
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,940
<13-8,ESPOSITO>她看到伯恩斯在离开之前
<13-8,ESPOSITO>said that she saw Burns and another guy having

389
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,320
<13-9,CASTLE>和另一个人大吵过一架
<13-9,CASTLE>a knock-down, drag-out yelling match just before he left.

<13-10,ESPOSITO>-关于什么  -她只记得那个人大喊道
<13-10,ESPOSITO>- About what? - All she remembers is the other guy yelling,

391
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,050
<13-10,ESPOSITO>"你要是敢报道出来  我发誓我会杀了你"
<13-10,ESPOSITO>"If you try to print that, I swear to god, I'll kill ya!"

395
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,820
<14-1,LUCA SABALINI>我是和伯恩斯吵了一架  那又怎样
<14-1,LUCA SABALINI>So me and Burns argued? So what?

396
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,970
<14-1,LUCA SABALINI>这是个自由的国家
<14-1,LUCA SABALINI>It's a free country.

397
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,900
<14-2,BECKETT>言论自由可不包括死亡危险  萨巴里尼先生
<14-2,BECKETT>Free speech doesn't cover death threats, Mr. Sabalini.

398
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,750
<14-4,LUCA SABALINI>-也不包括谋杀  -都说我昨晚在家了

399
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,390
<14-5,BECKETT>你是这么说的  但你妻子说的不一样
<14-5,BECKETT>Yeah, you did, but your wife tells us a different story.

400
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,360
<14-6,CASTLE>她记得在你以为她睡着了之后
<14-6,CASTLE>It seems she remembers you sneaking out before midnight,

401
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,080
<14-6,CASTLE>在午夜前偷偷溜了出去
<14-6,CASTLE>after you thought she was asleep.

402
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,480
<14-7,BECKETT>她说你是去
<14-7,BECKETT>She told us you were off to see

403
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,400
<14-7,BECKETT>"弗拉特布什会那个淫荡的情妇"
<14-7,BECKETT>"that whore mistress of his over in Flatbush",

404
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,390
<14-7,BECKETT>早上她质问你这事的时候
<14-7,BECKETT>and when she confronted you about it this morning,

405
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,340
<14-7,BECKETT>你说你是进城了
<14-7,BECKETT>you told her that you went into the city

406
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,120
<14-7,BECKETT>因为店里的警报响了
<14-7,BECKETT>because the store alarm was going off.

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,910
<14-8,CASTLE>我们核实了  没响过
<14-8,CASTLE>We checked. It wasn't.

408
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,330
<14-9,BECKETT>那么你是对谁撒谎了呢  我还是你妻子
<14-9,BECKETT>So who were you lying to, Luca, me or your wife?

409
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,640

<14-10,LUCA SABALINI>I was with Angie last night. You can ask her.

411
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,600
<14-11,BECKETT>我会问的  但那不代表我会相信她
<14-11,BECKETT>I could. But it doesn't mean I'm gonna believe her.

412
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,630
<14-11,BECKETT>你跟伯恩斯为了什么事争吵
<14-11,BECKETT>What were you and Burns fighting about?

413
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,940
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>他要写一些有关我的东西
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>He was gonna write something about me,

414
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,180
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>会毁掉我努力经营的一切
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>destroy everything I've worked for.

415
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,290
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>-我必须阻止他  -他要写什么
<14-12,LUCA SABALINI>- I had to stop him. - And what was he gonna write?

416
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,660
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>有关我的披萨
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>About my pizza.

417
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,650
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>有关我的无脂披萨为什么这么好吃
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>About what makes my fat-free pizza taste so good.

418
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,910
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>我是用真正的奶酪做的
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>It's made with real cheese.

419
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,760
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>根本就不是无脂的
<14-14,LUCA SABALINI>There's nothing fat-free about it.

420
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,440
<14-15,CASTLE>-你为这就说要杀他  -就是表达愤怒
<14-15,CASTLE>- You were gonna kill for that? - It's an expression.

421
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,200
<14-16,LUCA SABALINI>再说  昨晚伯恩斯给我打电话  说
<14-16,LUCA SABALINI>Besides, Burns called me last night. He said

422
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,830
<14-16,LUCA SABALINI>如果我能帮他一个忙  就不会写出来
<14-16,LUCA SABALINI>he'd consider not running it if I'd do him a favor.

423
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,070
<14-17,CASTLE>什么忙
<14-17,CASTLE>What favor?

424
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,520
<14-18,LUCA SABALINI>他没说
<14-18,LUCA SABALINI>Hey, he didn't say what.

425
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,730
<14-18,LUCA SABALINI>他本来说要今天来找我谈的
<14-18,LUCA SABALINI>He was supposed to stop by today to talk about it.

426
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,980
<14-19,BECKETT>你说他昨晚给你打电话了  从哪打来的
<14-19,BECKETT>You said that he called you yesterday? From where?

427
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,550
<15-1,RYAN>好的  查到了  打到他手机上的电话

<16-1,CASTLE>Paid in cash, signed in under the name Melville.

433
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,280
<16-2,CASTLE>这家伙是一心要躲起来啊
<16-2,CASTLE>This guy's definitely flying under the radar.

434
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880

<16-4,CASTLE>delicate prose.

439
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,950
<16-4,CASTLE>这不是一篇惊爆内幕
<16-4,CASTLE>This is not an expose.

440
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,570
<16-6,CASTLE>-就是一篇推广报道  -都能闻到蒜香了
<16-6,CASTLE>- It's a puff piece. - Well, I can practically smell the garlic,

<16-12,CASTLE>就是这个号码的主人  而且就在他死前
<16-12,CASTLE>Someone from that phone number, just before he was killed.

<16-15,BECKETT>对  纽约警方发布的  才安装上
<16-15,BECKETT>Yeah, NYPD issue. We just got it.

<16-16,CASTLE>- Can I... - Whoa.

456
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,470
<16-17,BECKETT>好吧
<16-17,BECKETT>Fine.

457
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,590
<16-18,CASTLE>你也别想玩我的"愤怒的小鸟"
<16-18,CASTLE>Then you don't get to play my "Angry birds",

458
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,530
<16-19,CASTLE>刚刚出了新款的
<16-19,CASTLE>and they just came out with a new one.

459
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,670
<16-19,CASTLE>"强尼·法瑞尔  斯维德·安德森"
<16-19,CASTLE>"Johnny Farrell, Swede Anderson."

460
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,580
<16-19,CASTLE>貌似有点印象
<16-19,CASTLE>How do I know those names?

461
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,910
<16-20,BECKETT>我没听过  你认出这是谁了吗
<16-20,BECKETT>I don't know, but recognize this person?

462
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,090
<16-21,CASTLE>伯恩斯钱包里的照片上那个女人
<16-21,CASTLE>That's the woman from Burns' wallet.

463
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,940
<16-22,BECKETT>没错  莫妮卡·怀特
<16-22,BECKETT>Bingo. Monica Wyatt.

464
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,220
<16-22,BECKETT>如果她昨晚见过他
<16-22,BECKETT>And if she met with him last night,

465
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,320
<16-22,BECKETT>那她可能是最后一个见到活着的伯恩斯的人
<16-22,BECKETT>she might be the last person to have seen him alive.

466
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,090
<16-23,CASTLE>你说他们有没有一起吃披萨呢
<16-23,CASTLE>I wonder if they went out for pizza.

467
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,860
<17-1,BECKETT>对于卖披萨的来说是不是太高档了
<17-1,BECKETT>Little upscale for the pizza world.

468
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,340
<17-2,CASTLE>除非她是中间人
<17-2,CASTLE>Unless she's a middle man.

469
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,560
<17-2,CASTLE>洗钱业务的中间人
<17-2,CASTLE>For the money laundering operation?

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,730
<17-2,CASTLE>她用强尼·法瑞尔和斯维德·安德森的假名
<17-2,CASTLE>She transfers the assets out of country

471
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,150
<17-2,CASTLE>把资产过户到国外
<17-2,CASTLE>into Swiss Bank accounts using the names

<17-2,CASTLE>存到瑞士银行的账户里
<17-2,CASTLE>Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.

473
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,320
<17-3,BECKETT>或许她就像她说的那样是个房地产经纪人
<17-3,BECKETT>Or she's just a real estate agent as she claims to be.

474
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,190
<17-4,CASTLE>那只是她为了躲避调查局的审查
<17-4,CASTLE>Oh, that's just her cover to avoid

475
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,260
<17-4,CASTLE>所用的掩护身份
<17-4,CASTLE>scrutiny with the Feds.

476
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,530
<17-5,BECKETT>你小时候  有很多
<17-5,BECKETT>You had a lot of imaginary

477
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,740
<17-5,BECKETT>-想象出来的朋友吧  -现在也有啊
<17-5,BECKETT>- friends growing up, didn't you? - Still do.

478
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,780
<17-7,MONICA WYATT>你们好  有事吗
<17-7,MONICA WYATT>Hi. Can I help you?

479
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,340
<18-1,MONICA WYATT>真不敢相信他还留着这个
<18-1,MONICA WYATT>I can't believe he still had this.

480
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,380
<18-1,MONICA WYATT>我们第一次约会的时候他拍了这张照片
<18-1,MONICA WYATT>He actually took this on our first date.

481
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,730
<18-2,BECKETT>你们在一起多长时间
<18-2,BECKETT>And how long were the two of you together?

482
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,880
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>就几个月
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>Just a couple of months,

483
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,690
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>不过那应该是三年前了
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>but god, this had to be three years ago.

484
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,530
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>他女儿出事后我们见过几次
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>I saw him once or twice after his daughter's accident.

485
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,530
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>他人变了  就好像人还在  魂飞了
<18-3,MONICA WYATT>He was different. It's like he just drifted away.

486
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,140
<18-4,CASTLE>你昨晚为什么去见他
<18-4,CASTLE>What made you see him last night?

487
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,280
<18-5,MONICA WYATT>我昨晚没见到他
<18-5,MONICA WYATT>I-I didn't see him last night.

488
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,630
<18-6,BECKETT>不过他的记事本上写他要在晚上十点见你
<18-6,BECKETT>Well, according to his notes, he met up with you at 10:00 p.m.

489
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,390
<18-7,MONICA WYATT>不是见面  是约会
<18-7,MONICA WYATT>Well, that wasn't a meeting. That was a date.

490
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,340
<18-7,MONICA WYATT>但是  他没来
<18-7,MONICA WYATT>But... he didn't show.

491
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,200
<18-8,CASTLE>你说你们几年没见了
<18-8,CASTLE>You said you hadn't seen him in years.

492
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
<18-8,CASTLE>那你们怎么又约上会了呢
<18-8,CASTLE>How did you end up on a date?

493
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,490
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>我们前些天在街上偶遇
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>We bumped into each other in the street the other day.

494
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,590
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>说来巧的出奇
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>It was weird because...

495
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,360
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>因为那是在格林威治村  我从不去那里
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>it was in the village, and I never go down there,

496
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,890
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>他说他也从不去那里
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>and he said he doesn't go down there either,

497
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,580
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>不过他正在写一篇报道
<18-9,MONICA WYATT>but he was working on a story.

498
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,660
<18-10,BECKETT>他跟你说是关于什么的报道了吗
<18-10,BECKETT>Did he tell you what it was about?

499
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,870
<18-11,MONICA WYATT>没有
<18-11,MONICA WYATT>No.

500
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,490
<18-12,CASTLE>他看起来怎么样  焦虑  苦恼
<18-12,CASTLE>How did he seem... uh, worried, distressed?

501
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,180
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>他看起来像他自己
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>He seemed like himself,

502
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,720
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>像以前的那个他
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>like his old self,

503
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,450
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>像是挖掘到了什么内幕一样
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>like he was on to something.

504
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,340
<18-14,BECKETT>他刚从记录大厅回来
<18-14,BECKETT>He'd just come from The Hall of Records,

505
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,660
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>不知道他找到了什么  反正让他很激动
<18-13,MONICA WYATT>and whatever he found, he was really excited about.

506
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,030
<18-14,BECKETT>记录大厅
<18-14,BECKETT>The Hall of Records?

507
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,130
<18-15,MONICA WYATT>是的
<18-15,MONICA WYATT>Yeah.

508

<18-16,CASTLE>Ms. Wyatt, do the names Johnny Farrell

509

<18-16,CASTLE>这两个名字你听到过吗
<18-16,CASTLE>or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

510
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,590
<18-17,MONICA WYATT>没听过
<18-17,MONICA WYATT>I can't say they do.

<18-17,MONICA WYATT>莫妮卡·怀特的话得到证实了
<18-17,MONICA WYATT>Monica Wyatt... checks.

512

<19-1,BECKETT>她的经纪行说她
<19-1,BECKETT>Her brokerage house says that she complains

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,620
<19-1,BECKETT>总是抱怨佣金太低  很惹人烦
<19-1,BECKETT>about commissions more than they'd like,

514
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
<19-1,BECKETT>不过除此之外  她没什么不良记录
<19-1,BECKETT>but other than that, she's clean.

515
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,240
<19-1,BECKETT>那个记事本上还有别的吗
<19-1,BECKETT>You find anything else in there?

516
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,370
<19-2,CASTLE>没有  其他的都是披萨的事了
<19-2,CASTLE>Nope. The rest is just pizza.

517
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,550
<19-3,RYAN>我刚刚查完伯恩斯的财务记录
<19-3,RYAN>I just got through Burns' financials.

518
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,020
<19-4,BECKETT>-昨晚有记录吗  -有  很奇怪
<19-4,BECKETT>- Any activity last night? - Uh, yeah. Something odd.

519
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,280
<19-5,RYAN>晚上11点15分  他用了自动提款机
<19-5,RYAN>11:15 p.m., he used his ATM card.

520
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,130
<19-6,BECKETT>-在哪  -在一个不怎么好的街区
<19-6,BECKETT>- Where? - A not-so-good neighborhood

521
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,810
<19-7,RYAN>离正宗尼克披萨店就15个街区
<19-7,RYAN>about 15 blocks away from Authentic Nick's.

522
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,830
<19-7,RYAN>但奇怪的是  他都没完成取款
<19-7,RYAN>But here's the odd part-- he never finished the transaction.

523
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,700
<19-8,CASTLE>你是说他取消了取款
<19-8,CASTLE>You mean he canceled it.

524
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,460
<19-9,RYAN>不是  是没完成
<19-9,RYAN>No, no, he never finished it.

525
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,310
<19-9,RYAN>他插入了银行卡
<19-9,RYAN>He popped in his ATM card,

526
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,440
<19-9,RYAN>一分钟后  没有操作
<19-9,RYAN>but then after about a minute of inactivity,

527
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,050
<19-9,RYAN>卡被吞了  就像...
<19-9,RYAN>it ate his card. It's almost as if--

528
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,080
<19-10,CASTLE>发生了什么事
<19-10,CASTLE>Something happened.

529
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,400
<19-11,BECKETT>去找自动柜员机的录像  看看怎么回事
<19-11,BECKETT>Get ATM surveillance. Let's find out what.

530
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,920
<19-11,BECKETT>我明早去下记录厅
<19-11,BECKETT>I'm gonna go to the hall of records tomorrow morning

531
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,760
<19-11,BECKETT>看看能不能发现伯恩斯在忙什么
<19-11,BECKETT>and see if we can figure out what Burns was up to.

532
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,250
<20-2,CASTLE>出什么事了
<20-2,CASTLE>What happened?

533
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,000
<20-3,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯没听劝阻
<20-3,MARTHA>Alexis decided to crash Lauren's party,

534
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,740
<20-3,MARTHA>闯入了劳伦的派对
<20-3,MARTHA>against our better judgment...

535
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,880
<20-4,CASTLE>我想
<20-4,CASTLE>And I take it that

536
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,940
<20-4,CASTLE>擅闯派对进行得并不顺利
<20-4,CASTLE>the, uh, party crashing didn't go so well?

537
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,950
<20-5,ALEXIS>如果劳伦不是全世界最无耻的贱人
<20-5,ALEXIS>None of this would've happened if Lauren wasn't

538
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,630
<20-5,ALEXIS>这一切也不会发生
<20-5,ALEXIS>the most conniving bitch in the entire world.

539
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,420
<20-7,MARTHA>-是有根据的  -乐队表演的时候
<20-7,MARTHA>- It's warranted. - When the band was performing,

540
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,340
<20-8,ALEXIS>劳伦带着阿什利走上台
<20-8,ALEXIS>Lauren brought Ashley up on stage with her,

541
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,620
<20-8,ALEXIS>而且她当众吻了他
<20-8,ALEXIS>and she kissed him in front of everyone.

542
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,370
<20-10,ALEXIS>-真贱  -她怎么能这么对我和阿什利
<20-10,ALEXIS>- Bitch. - How could she do this to me, to Ashley?

543
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,240
<20-11,CASTLE>-阿什利有什么反应  -他窘死了
<20-11,CASTLE>- What did Ashley do? - He was mortified.

544
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,640
<20-12,ALEXIS>他从台上下来  我们就走了
<20-12,ALEXIS>He ran off stage, and we left.

545
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,630
<20-12,ALEXIS>他道了无数次歉
<20-12,ALEXIS>I mean, he was apologizing a thousand times and said

546
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,570
<20-12,ALEXIS>说他压根不知道她会这么做
<20-12,ALEXIS>he had no idea that she was gonna do that.

547
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,360
<20-12,ALEXIS>感觉她这是想拆散我们
<20-12,ALEXIS>It's like she's been trying to break us up this whole time.

548
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,030
<20-12,ALEXIS>这都是她的邪恶计划
<20-12,ALEXIS>It's been her master plan.

549
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,660
<20-13,MARTHA>亲爱的  可她没成功
<20-13,MARTHA>Well, she didn't succeed, darling.

550
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,110
<20-13,MARTHA>你和阿什利的关系比以前更紧密了
<20-13,MARTHA>You and Ashley are stronger than ever,

551
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,680
<20-13,MARTHA>而且她让自己看起来像个傻瓜
<20-13,MARTHA>and-- and she looks like a fool.

552
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,050
<20-14,ALEXIS>我倒希望是这样
<20-14,ALEXIS>Yeah, I wish that were true.

553
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,400
<20-14,ALEXIS>可根据网上的说法  阿什利出轨了
<20-14,ALEXIS>But according to the internet, Ashley cheated on me.

554
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,160
<20-14,ALEXIS>她把他们接吻的照片
<20-14,ALEXIS>She already posted the pictures of them kissing

555
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,470
<20-14,ALEXIS>传到了她的网站上
<20-14,ALEXIS>all over her web site.

556
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,900
<20-14,ALEXIS>真是噩梦一场
<20-14,ALEXIS>It's a nightmare.

557
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,110
<20-14,ALEXIS>贝克特去哪了
<20-14,ALEXIS>Where's Beckett?

558
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,370
<21-1,CASTLE>记录厅

<21-4,RYAN>Did someone find naked pictures of you again?

564
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,430
<21-5,CASTLE>和我无关  是阿丽克西斯
<21-5,CASTLE>No, it's not me. It's Alexis.

565
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,290
<21-6,CASTLE>是为了阿丽克西斯

<21-11,BECKETT>而滥用警力资源这种事吗
<21-11,BECKETT>for your own personal agenda?

578
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,140
<21-12,CASTLE>你在说什么啊
<21-12,CASTLE>What?

<21-20,CASTLE>跟正宗尼克披萨店扯上关系了吗
<21-20,CASTLE>mafia tie-in with Authentic Nick's?

595

596
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,300
<21-21,BECKETT>披萨店跟任何一个黑帮家庭都没有关系
<21-21,BECKETT>there's no connection to any of the families.

597
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,200
<21-22,CASTLE>有人不喜欢他
<21-22,CASTLE>Someone didn't like him.

600
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,220

<21-23,BECKETT>争斗中  被一个毒贩杀了
<21-23,BECKETT>a dealer killed him over a turf war.

602
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
<21-24,CASTLE>为什么伯恩斯要关注他
<21-24,CASTLE>So why was Burns looking at him?

603
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,180

614
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,110

<22-9,ESPOSITO>but he recorded his own murder.

615
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,760
<22-10,BECKETT>放大那张脸
<22-10,BECKETT>Close up on the face.

616
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,250
<22-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看那是谁
<22-11,BECKETT>Castle, look at that face.

617
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,970
<22-12,CASTLE>竟然是赫利·罗梅罗
<22-12,CASTLE>That's Harley Romero.

618
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,820
<22-13,BECKETT>而且他还活得好好的
<22-13,BECKETT>And he is very much alive.

619
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,020
<22-14,MONTGOMERY>他为什么要停下来写这条讯息呢
<22-14,MONTGOMERY>Why would he stop to write a message?

620
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,190
<22-14,MONTGOMERY>为什么不继续跑呢
<22-14,MONTGOMERY>Why not just keep running?

621
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,430
<22-15,CASTLE>那条街通向一个死胡同
<22-15,CASTLE>Well, that street empties on to a blind alley.

622
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,840
<22-15,CASTLE>或许伯恩斯觉得自己跑不了了
<22-15,CASTLE>Maybe Burns thought he couldn't get away.

623
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,850
<22-16,MONTGOMERY>知道他写的是什么吗
<22-16,MONTGOMERY>Any idea what he was writing there?

624
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,410
<22-17,BECKETT>要看技术部门能不能加强图像效果了
<22-17,BECKETT>We're seeing if tech can enhance the image,

625
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,570
<22-17,BECKETT>可我们还没发现
<22-17,BECKETT>But we found no connection

626
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,720
<22-17,BECKETT>赫利和披萨店的联系
<22-17,BECKETT>between this Harley and the pizza joints.

627
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,300
<22-18,MONTGOMERY>如果两者本来就没关系呢
<22-18,MONTGOMERY>Maybe pizza has nothing to do with it.

628
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,430
<22-18,MONTGOMERY>伯恩斯可能从以前的报道中知道赫利的
<22-18,MONTGOMERY>Maybe Burns knew Harley from an old story.

629
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,820
<23-1,CHARLES SHAW>不  我不认识这人
<23-1,CHARLES SHAW>No. I-I don't recognize him at all.

630
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,750
<23-2,BECKETT>伯恩斯有在他报道里
<23-2,BECKETT>Did Burns ever mention the name Harley

631
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,700
<23-2,BECKETT>提到赫利这名字吗
<23-2,BECKETT>in any of his stories?

632
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,650
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>从没有过  这家伙诈死的时候
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>Never. When this guy supposedly died,

633
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,890
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>格顿在跟随海军二师
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>Gordon was embedded with the 2nd Marine Division

634
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,040
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>报道第二次海湾战争
<23-3,CHARLES SHAW>in Gulf II.

635
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,140
<23-4,CASTLE>肖恩先生  你知道强尼·法瑞尔
<23-4,CASTLE>Mr. Shaw, do the names Johnny Farrell

636
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,160
<23-4,CASTLE>或者斯维德·安德森有什么意思吗
<23-4,CASTLE>or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

637
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,080
<23-5,CHARLES SHAW>当然
<23-5,CHARLES SHAW>Yeah. They do.

638
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,770
<23-5,CHARLES SHAW>他们都是老式好莱坞犯罪片里的角色
<23-5,CHARLES SHAW>They're both characters from old film noir movies.

639
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,890
<23-6,CASTLE>对了  强尼·法瑞尔是《吉尔达》里
<23-6,CASTLE>Right. Uh, Johnny Farrell from the movie "Gilda,"

640
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,160
<23-6,CASTLE>格伦·福特扮演的角色  伯特·兰卡斯特扮演
<23-6,CASTLE>Glenn Ford's character, and Burt Lancaster played

641
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,720
<23-6,CASTLE>《杀手》里的斯维德·安德森
<23-6,CASTLE>Swede Anderson in "The Killers."

642
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,380
<23-7,BECKETT>这两个名字有什么特殊之处吗
<23-7,BECKETT>And why would these two names be important?

643
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,400
<23-8,CHARLES SHAW>赫利这家伙买卖的是哪种毒品
<23-8,CHARLES SHAW>This guy--Harley--what kind of drugs was he dealing?

644
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,130
<23-9,BECKETT>海洛因  怎么了
<23-9,BECKETT>Heroin, why?

645
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,980
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>伯恩斯追踪过的唯一一个海洛因报道
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>Because the only heroin story Burns ever chased

646
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,760
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>是他一直没能完成的那篇
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>was the one that he could never finish.

647
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,880
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>关于纽约高端贩毒圈里
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>About a high-end distribution ring in New York

648
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,680
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>用合法生意掩护海洛因交易
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>that sets up shop inside legitimate businesses.

649
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,570
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>有人需要购买时  就用密码进行交易
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>When someone needed product, they'd use a code word.

650
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,310
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>而那些密码就来自于老电影里的角色名
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>Their code happens to be names of characters from film noir.

651
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,500
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>就是这个故事毁了他
<23-10,CHARLES SHAW>It's that story that destroyed him.

652
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,580
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>-怎么说  -那个在后台操控交易的人
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>- Why? - Because of the guy who was behind the ring.

653
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,630
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>是卡瓦罗
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>It was Cavallo.

654
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,500
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>格顿·伯恩斯惹到了黑暗王子本尊
<23-12,CHARLES SHAW>Gordon Burns was gunning for the Prince of Darkness himself.

655
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,830
<23-13,CASTLE>卡瓦罗是谁
<23-13,CASTLE>Who's Cavallo?

656
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,810
<23-14,BECKETT>只是一个街头神话  都市传说罢了
<23-14,BECKETT>It's a-a street myth, an urban legend.

657
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,180
<23-14,BECKETT>每当有毒贩子被杀
<23-14,BECKETT>Anytime a dealer gets whacked,

658
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,090
<23-14,BECKETT>人们都说是卡瓦罗干的
<23-14,BECKETT>people always say it's Cavallo,

659
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,730
<23-14,BECKETT>但这个人物根本不存在
<23-14,BECKETT>but he's not even real.

660
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,380
<23-15,CHARLES SHAW>有卡瓦罗这号人物
<23-15,CHARLES SHAW>Oh, Cavallo's real.

661
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,370
<23-15,CHARLES SHAW>算了吧  肖恩
<23-15,CHARLES SHAW>Come on, Shaw.

662
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,440
<23-16,BECKETT>这类的惊悚故事我们都听过
<23-16,BECKETT>We've all heard the scary stories.

663
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,460
<23-17,CASTLE>我没听过
<23-17,CASTLE>I didn't.

664
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,240
<23-18,BECKETT>据说卡瓦罗曾跟着无恶不作且有
<23-18,BECKETT>So the story goes that Cavallo was mentored

665
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,210
<23-18,BECKETT>"征服者"之称的哥伦比亚大毒枭
<23-18,BECKETT>by this badass Colombian drug lord--

666
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,480
<23-18,BECKETT>卡赞混过
<23-18,BECKETT>Khazi "The conqueror"--

667
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,060
<23-18,BECKETT>最后他用枪打爆了老板的头
<23-18,BECKETT>and eventually he put a bullet to his boss' head,

668
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,710
<23-18,BECKETT>割断了老板所有孩子的喉咙
<23-18,BECKETT>slit all of his kids' throats,

669
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,840
<23-18,BECKETT>然后抢班夺权
<23-18,BECKETT>and took over the operation.

670
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,870
<23-18,BECKETT>但这一切都只是个传说
<23-18,BECKETT>But I mean, it's a fairy tale.

671
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,580
<23-18,BECKETT>对伯恩斯来说不是
<23-18,BECKETT>Not to Burns.

672
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,510
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>对他女儿也不是
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>Not to his daughter.

673
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,700
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>伯恩斯曾跟我说过他有门路
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>Burns told me he had a contact

674
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,590
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>能接近卡瓦罗
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>that was getting him close to Cavallo.

675
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,650
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>第二天  他和女儿
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>The next day, he and his daughter

676
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,280
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>正过马路的时候
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>are crossing the street,

677
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,740
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>一辆车突然冲出来
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>this car appears out of nowhere.

678
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,510
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>当他反应过来的时候
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>When he came to,

679
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,320
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>腿已经被撞得粉碎
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>his leg was shattered.

680
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,460
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>尼娜被撞飞20英尺远  流血不止
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>Nina was 20 feet away, bleeding out,

681
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,020
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>他想过去抱住她  却爬都爬不过去
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>and he couldn't even crawl over to hold her,

682
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,340
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>所以别再说卡瓦罗不存在
<23-19,CHARLES SHAW>so don't you tell me Cavallo isn't real.

683
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,220
<24-1,CASTLE>听起来伯恩斯像是阿哈
<24-1,CASTLE>It sounds like Burns was Ahab,

685
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,560
<24-1,CASTLE>卡瓦罗是白鲸
<24-1,CASTLE>and Cavallo was white whale.

686
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,110
<24-2,BECKETT>他还用梅尔维尔这个名字登入酒店呢
<24-2,BECKETT>Well, he did sign in to the hotel as Melville.

687
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,420
<24-3,CASTLE>伯恩斯就是靠这种诡秘的幽默感出名的
<24-3,CASTLE>You know, it's that kind of sly humor that Burns was known for.

688
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,020
<24-3,CASTLE>尽管我不喜欢侧写
<24-3,CASTLE>And while I am loathe to profile,

689
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,130
<24-3,CASTLE>卡瓦罗这个名字
<24-3,CASTLE>the name Cavallo--

690
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,230
<24-3,CASTLE>在意大利语中有"海洛因"的意思
<24-3,CASTLE>also the Italian word for "Horse"--

691
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,430
<24-3,CASTLE>暗示了这和四家尼克披萨店有某种联系
<24-3,CASTLE>might suggest a link back to the four Nick's.

692
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,250
<24-4,BECKETT>莱恩  你在缉毒组的时候
<24-4,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. When you were in narcotics,

693
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,250
<24-4,BECKETT>第一次听到卡瓦罗这个名字是什么时候
<24-4,BECKETT>when was the first time you heard the name Cavallo?

694
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,270
<24-5,RYAN>记不清了  大概是03年左右吧
<24-5,RYAN>I don't know. Probably around, uh, '03.

695
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,110
<24-5,RYAN>那个时候很多毒贩都被杀了
<24-5,RYAN>Around all that time all those dealers were getting whacked.

696
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,770
<24-6,BECKETT>对  赫利也是那时候被杀的
<24-6,BECKETT>Well, that's right when Harley was killed.

697
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,000
<24-7,CASTLE>那么赫利伪装了自己的死亡
<24-7,CASTLE>So Harley stages his own death,

698
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,670
<24-7,CASTLE>残忍地杀害了竞争对手
<24-7,CASTLE>brutally murders his competition,

699
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,030
<24-7,CASTLE>然后又散播小道消息说
<24-7,CASTLE>and then starts a whisper campaign on the streets

700
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,810
<24-7,CASTLE>新的黑暗王子出现了
<24-7,CASTLE>about the new Dark Prince of Heroin...

701
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,940
<24-8,BECKETT>一个传说就这样诞生了
<24-8,BECKETT>And a legend is born.

702
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,440
<24-9,ESPOSITO>技术人员把自动取款机的录像放大了
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Tech was able to blow up

703
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,110
<24-9,ESPOSITO>并且加强了清晰度
<24-9,ESPOSITO>and enhance that ATM video.

704
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,460
<24-9,ESPOSITO>录像正在传输
<24-9,ESPOSITO>They're sending it up now.

705
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,070
<25-1,BECKETT>还是看不清楚写的什么
<25-1,BECKETT>I still can't make it out.

706
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,160
<25-3,BECKETT>再放一遍
<25-3,BECKETT>Run it again.

707
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,460
<25-4,CASTLE>能把这个图像翻转一下  再慢点放吗
<25-4,CASTLE>Can you flip it and slow it down?

708
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,510
<25-5,BECKETT>-可以  -你要干嘛
<25-5,BECKETT>- Yeah. - What are you doing?

709
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,650
<25-6,CASTLE>我最擅长的  写字
<25-6,CASTLE>What I do best--writing.

710
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,360
<25-6,CASTLE>好  3
<25-6,CASTLE>Okay, 3...

711
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,680
<25-6,CASTLE>6  s
<25-6,CASTLE>6... s...

712
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,510
<25-8,CASTLE>-也能是5  -好吧  s或5
<25-8,CASTLE>- That could be a 5. - Okay, s or a 5...

713
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,060
<25-8,CASTLE>W-1-2  7
<25-8,CASTLE>W-1-2... 7?

714
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,200
<25-9,ESPOSITO>是个地址
<25-9,ESPOSITO>It's an address.

715
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,880
<25-10,CASTLE>B  a  s
<25-10,CASTLE>B... a... s?

716
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,610
<25-11,BECKETT>地下室
<25-11,BECKETT>Basement.

717
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,960
<25-11,BECKETT>西127号街365号的地下室
<25-11,BECKETT>365 west 127th street, in the basement.

718

<26-5,ESPOSITO>Envelopes for packaging.

725

<26-6,RYAN>All the earmarks of a well-organized

727
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,690

<26-7,BECKETT>看来阿哈找到他的白鲸了
<26-7,BECKETT>Looks like your Ahab found his white whale.

730
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,520
<26-8,CASTLE>还把他拉下了水
<26-8,CASTLE>And it took him under.

731
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,430
<27-1,ALEXIS>老爸好  老爸再见
<27-1,ALEXIS>Hi, dad. Bye, dad.

<27-4,ALEXIS>这还叫没事  发生什么事了
<27-4,ALEXIS>That's not nothing. What happened?

735
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,200
<27-5,CASTLE>是劳伦干的
<27-5,CASTLE>Lauren.

<27-6,ALEXIS>她把我堵在学校的厕所里
<27-6,ALEXIS>She cornered me in the bathrooms at school,

737
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,730
<27-6,ALEXIS>说我毁了她的派对
<27-6,ALEXIS>said I ruined her party,

738
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,910
<27-6,ALEXIS>还说我黑了她的账号
<27-6,ALEXIS>and then she accused me of hacking into her account

739
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,410
<27-6,ALEXIS>删了她照的那些照片
<27-6,ALEXIS>and deleting those pictures she took.

740
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,940
<27-6,ALEXIS>说的像真的似的
<27-6,ALEXIS>As if.

741
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,790
<27-7,CASTLE>然后怎么了
<27-7,CASTLE>And--and then what happened?

742
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,130
<27-8,ALEXIS>我说她在我背后捅刀子
<27-8,ALEXIS>Well, I called her a backstabber,

743
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,150
<27-8,ALEXIS>她就抓了我的脸  于是我
<27-8,ALEXIS>and then she scratched me, so I...

744
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,570
<27-10,ALEXIS>-你干什么了  -我给了她一拳
<27-10,ALEXIS>- You what? - I punched her.

745
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,130
<27-11,CASTLE>你当时怎么想的啊
<27-11,CASTLE>Ah. What were you thinking?

746
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,490
<27-11,CASTLE>我不知道  我从来不会这样
<27-11,CASTLE>I don't know. This isn't me.

747
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,910
<27-12,ALEXIS>我不会擅闯别人的派对
<27-12,ALEXIS>I don't crash parties.

748
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,180
<27-12,ALEXIS>也不会跟别人打架
<27-12,ALEXIS>I don't get in fights with people.

749
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,030
<27-12,ALEXIS>但是  爸爸  她真的让我怒火中烧
<27-12,ALEXIS>I... But, dad, she made me so angry.

750
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,880
<27-13,CASTLE>我知道  但是报复解决不了问题
<27-13,CASTLE>I know she did, but retaliation is not the answer.

751
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,680
<27-13,CASTLE>你报复她一次  她回击你一次
<27-13,CASTLE>You get her back, she gets you back,

752
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,540
<27-13,CASTLE>然后说不准哪天
<27-13,CASTLE>and then one day,

753
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,160
<27-13,CASTLE>你俩中的一个就死在披萨烤箱里了
<27-13,CASTLE>one of you ends up dead in a pizza oven.

754
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,700
<27-13,CASTLE>这是你想要的吗  关键是
<27-13,CASTLE>Is that what you want? Look, the point is,

755
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,560
<27-13,CASTLE>你一生中可能会跟很多这种卑鄙的
<27-13,CASTLE>you're gonna have to deal with mean, backstabbing girls

756
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,260
<27-13,CASTLE>背后伤人的女孩打交道
<27-13,CASTLE>your whole life.

757
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,630
<27-13,CASTLE>要学得精明一些  不受这些事的影响
<27-13,CASTLE>You need to learn to be smart enough to rise above.

758
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,370
<27-14,ALEXIS>好吗
<27-14,ALEXIS>Okay?

00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,890
<27-14,ALEXIS>好吧
<27-14,ALEXIS>Okay.

<27-15,CASTLE>过来
<27-15,CASTLE>Come here.

761
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,030
<27-16,CASTLE>你痛扁她了吗
<27-16,CASTLE>Did you kick her ass?

762
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,660
<27-17,ALEXIS>差不多
<27-17,ALEXIS>I kinda did.

763
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,790
<27-18,CASTLE>好样的
<27-18,CASTLE>Good girl.

764
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,800
<28-1,CASTLE>我应该早点干涉这件事的
<28-1,CASTLE>I should've gotten involved much earlier.

765
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,590
<28-2,BECKETT>为什么  劳伦还是会找机会
<28-2,BECKETT>Why? Lauren would've still found a way

766
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,430
<28-2,BECKETT>让阿丽克西斯苦不堪言的
<28-2,BECKETT>to make Alexis' life miserable.

767
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,640
<28-3,CASTLE>劳伦又不是犯罪老手
<28-3,CASTLE>Lauren isn't a criminal mastermind.

768
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,320
<28-3,CASTLE>-她不过是个青少年  -卡塞尔
<28-3,CASTLE>- She's just a teenager. - Ah, Castle,

769
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,950
<28-4,BECEKTT>永远不要低估肩负使命的女人的力量
<28-4,BECEKTT>never underestimate the power of a woman on a mission.

770
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,940
<28-5,CASTLE>不会的  我的赡养费支票证明了这一点
<28-5,CASTLE>No, I don't. And I have the alimony checks to prove it.

771
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,900
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  我刚跟实验室那边通完电话
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, just hung up with the lab.

772
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,120
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>海洛因加工坊发现的毒品残留
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>That trace heroin from the processing house?

773
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,660
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>与下东区兜售的毒品相匹配
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>It matches most of the dope being peddled on the Lower East.

774
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,860
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>有赫利的线索吗
<28-6,MONTGOMERY>Any word on this Harley?

775
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,610
<28-7,BECKETT>长官  如果关于这家伙的传言有一半是真的
<28-7,BECKETT>Sir, if half of the rumors about this guy are true,

776
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,450
<28-7,BECKETT>那么他的眼线到处都是
<28-7,BECKETT>then he's got snitches all over the force,

777
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,170
<28-7,BECKETT>所以我想等有足够的证据再全面通缉他
<28-7,BECKETT>so I was thinking of holding off on an A.P.B. until we knew more.

778
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,790
<28-8,MONTGOMERY>-随时向我汇报  -遵命
<28-8,MONTGOMERY>- Keep me posted. - Yes, sir.

779
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,110
<28-9,BECKETT>肖恩说过卡瓦罗
<28-9,BECKETT>You know, Shaw said that Cavallo

780
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:46,130
<28-10,CASTLE>在利用很多正当业务销售毒品
<28-10,CASTLE>is using legitimate businesses to distribute product.

781
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,180
<28-10,CASTLE>你觉得他有没有可能就操控着
<28-10,CASTLE>You think he could be operating

782
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,150
<28-10,CASTLE>尼克披萨店中的一家
<28-10,CASTLE>out of one of the Nicks'?

783
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,360
<28-11,BECKETT>可能  这种无根据的调查我是拿不到搜查令的
<28-11,BECKETT>Yeah, but I can't get a warrant for a fishing expedition.

784
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,120
<28-11,BECKETT>我们需要掌握更确凿的证据
<28-11,BECKETT>We're gonna have to have something more concrete.

785
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,710
<28-12,ESPOSITO>鉴证组把那个地下室搜了个底朝天
<28-12,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. swept the tenement basement top to bottom,

786
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,770
<28-12,ESPOSITO>连个指纹也没找到
<28-12,ESPOSITO>there's not one print anywhere.

787
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,400
<28-13,BECKETT>有目击者看见伯恩斯被追杀了吗
<28-13,BECKETT>Any witnesses see Burns getting chased?

788
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,710
<28-14,RYAN>在那片街区  看见了也没人说的
<28-14,RYAN>In that neighborhood, nobody sees nothing.

789
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,800
<28-14,RYAN>不过我们有一位警员
<28-14,RYAN>But one of our uniforms

790
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,340
<28-14,RYAN>在自动取款机附近的下水道里发现了这个
<28-14,RYAN>did find this in a storm drain near the ATM.

791
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,000
<28-15,BECKETT>伯恩斯的手机
<28-15,BECKETT>Burns' phone?

792
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,650
<28-16,CASTLE>你们不觉得奇怪吗
<28-16,CASTLE>Does it strike anyone else as strange

793
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,730
<28-16,CASTLE>一个经验丰富的战地记者
<28-16,CASTLE>that a seasoned war correspondent

794
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,450
<28-16,CASTLE>会突然变得笨手笨脚
<28-16,CASTLE>would suddenly develop butterfingers,

795
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,620
<28-16,CASTLE>被追的时候掉了手机吗
<28-16,CASTLE>drop his phone while being chased?

796
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,890
<28-17,BECKETT>你认为他是故意的
<28-17,BECKETT>You think he purposefully dropped it?

797
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,100
<28-18,CASTLE>这样追他的的人就拿不到他的手机
<28-18,CASTLE>So that whoever was chasing him wouldn't get his phone?

798
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,240
<28-19,BECKETT>或是他手机上的东西
<28-19,BECKETT>Or what was on it.

799
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,400
<28-20,BECKETT>他最后打的电话是911
<28-20,BECKETT>The last call he made was 9-1-1

800
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,240
<28-20,BECKETT>但是他没有打出去
<28-20,BECKETT>and he didn't press send.

801
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,030
<28-21,CASTLE>毒品加工坊的外面
<28-21,CASTLE>Outside the drug lab.

802
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,680
<28-21,CASTLE>他在蹲点
<28-21,CASTLE>He was casing the joint.

803
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,190
<28-22,BECKETT>那是莫妮卡  她也参与其中
<28-22,BECKETT>That's Monica. She's involved.

<30-6,BECKETT>现在这种情形就别隐瞒了  谁干的
<30-6,BECKETT>I think we're past that. Who did it?

815
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,480
<30-7,MONICA WYATT>卡瓦罗
<30-7,MONICA WYATT>Cavallo.

816
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,320

<31-1,MONICA WYATT>We did date years ago, and I thought it was real,

818
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,850
<31-1,MONICA WYATT>但他那么做只是为了接近卡瓦罗
<31-1,MONICA WYATT>but he was just doing it to get close to Cavallo.

819
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,520
<31-1,MONICA WYATT>我从没想过
<31-1,MONICA WYATT>I never imagined that...

820
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,130
<31-2,CASTLE>一个市中心房地产经纪人

<31-2,CASTLE>doing mixed up with heroin dealers?

822
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,320
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>他们的作坊地点经常更换
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>Their labs are mobile.

823
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,190
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>他们的加工中心
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>They need new places

824
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,510
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>每个月都要换新地点
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>for their processing centers every month or so,

825
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,540
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>而我有他们所需要的信息
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>and I had access to all the information that they needed.

826
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,690
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>听着  我不是这样的
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>Look... This is not who I am.

827
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,570
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>我是说  我从没想到...
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>I mean, I never meant for anything...

828
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,330
<31-4,BECKETT>你是怎么开始的
<31-4,BECKETT>How did it start?

829
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,530
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>几年前我有些麻烦
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>I had some problems a few years back.

830
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,750
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>我欠了一些人钱
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>I owed some people money.

831
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>一个男人找到我
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>A man came to me

832
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,580
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>告诉我他可以解决我的问题
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>and he told me that he could make it all better.

833
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,950
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>我只要  时不时的帮他们点小忙
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>I just... Had to do a favor for him every now and then.

834
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,800
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>那时候听上去没什么坏处
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>And at the time, that actually sounded harmless.

835
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,820
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>但是这个男人知道我的事情
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>But this man knew things about me.

836
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,380
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>我是说那些没人可能知道的事情
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>I mean things that nobody could possibly know.

837
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,460
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>我想过离开
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>And I wanted to leave,

838
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,450
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>但是  格顿孩子出事之后  我就
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>but... after what happened to Gordon's kid, I just...

839
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,020
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>格顿几天前找到了我
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>Gordon found me a couple of days ago.

840
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,700
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>他说他需要我的帮助
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>He said he needed my help.

841
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,800
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>他说我可以结束这一切
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>He said that I could end this,

842
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,150
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>然后我们都可以自由了
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>and that we both could be free.

843
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,650
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>我只要把他带到那里
<31-5,MONICA WYATT>All I had to do was take him there.

844
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,070
<31-2,CASTLE>现在格顿死了
<31-2,CASTLE>And now Gordon is dead,

845
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,130
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>我就是下一个
<31-3,MONICA WYATT>and I am next.

846
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,280
<31-6,BECKETT>卡瓦罗是谁
<31-6,BECKETT>Cavallo--who is he?

847
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,530
<31-7,MONICA WYATT>我从来没见过他
<31-7,MONICA WYATT>I've never seen him.

848
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,720
<31-8,CASTLE>他刚刚不是试图想杀你吗
<31-8,CASTLE>Didn't he just try to kill you?

849
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,130
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>如果我知道卡瓦罗是谁
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>If I knew who Cavallo was,

850
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,630
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>我早就告诉格顿了
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>don't you think I would've told Gordon?

851
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,800
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>我只和卡瓦罗的副手接触过
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>I've only ever dealt with Cavallo's right-hand man before.

852
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,910
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>是他想要杀我
<31-9,MONICA WYATT>That's who was here trying to kill me.

853
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,800
<31-10,BECKETT>这个人是谁
<31-10,BECKETT>And who is this man?

854
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,150
<31-11,MONICA WYATT>他的名字是赫利
<31-11,MONICA WYATT>His name is Harley.

855
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:01,740
<31-12,BECKETT>他吗
<31-12,BECKETT>Him?

856
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,540
<31-13,CASTLE>赫利就是卡瓦罗
<31-13,CASTLE>Harley is Cavallo.

857
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,910
<31-13,CASTLE>这么说卡瓦罗就躲在我们的眼皮底下
<31-13,CASTLE>So Cavallo is hiding right under everyone's noses.

858
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:12,010
<31-14,BECKETT>-我怎样才能找到他  -都是他来找我
<31-14,BECKETT>- How do I find him? - He finds me.

859
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,740
<31-15,MONICA WYATT>莫妮卡  格顿说的对
<31-15,MONICA WYATT>Monica, Gordon was right.

860
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,130
<31-16,BECKETT>我们可以结束这一切  但是我们需要你的帮助
<31-16,BECKETT>We can end this, but we need your help.

861
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,970
<31-16,BECKETT>我们认为卡瓦罗通过一个披萨店
<31-16,BECKETT>We believe that Cavallo is trafficking drugs

862
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:21,760
<31-16,BECKETT>来贩运毒品
<31-16,BECKETT>through a pizzeria,

863
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,210
<31-16,BECKETT>但我们得知道是哪一个
<31-16,BECKETT>but we need to know which one.

864
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,060
<31-17,MONICA WYATT>对不起  我不知道是哪一个
<31-17,MONICA WYATT>I'm sorry. I don't know which one.

865
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,510
<31-18,ESPOSITO>我们找了整个区域
<31-18,ESPOSITO>We covered the whole area.

866
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,170
<31-19,RYAN>不管是谁  都让他逃走了
<31-19,RYAN>Whoever he was, he's in the wind.

867
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,490
<31-20,BECKETT>好吧  不如你们把莫妮卡送到急诊室
<31-20,BECKETT>All right. Why don't you guys take Monica to the E.R. ?

868
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,140
<31-20,BECKETT>给她做检查  然后把她送到缉毒组
<31-20,BECKETT>Get her checked, and then get her over to Narcotics.

869
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,710
<31-20,BECKETT>让他们和她谈谈
<31-20,BECKETT>Let them talk to her.

870
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,890
<31-21,CASTLE>最后一个问题
<31-21,CASTLE>One last question

871
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,300
<31-21,CASTLE>强尼·法瑞尔和斯维德·安德森
<31-21,CASTLE>Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson?

872
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,540
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>这是格顿跟进这件事的原因
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>That's how Gordon got on to this story in the first place.

873
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,700
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>他在披萨店里听到有人在用这几个名字
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>He heard somebody at one of the pizza joints using those names,

874
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,930
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>他知道这是卡瓦罗的暗号
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>and he knew it was Cavallo's code.

875
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,550
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>那些是上个星期的名字
<31-22,MONICA WYATT>Those were last week's names.

876
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,960
<31-23,BECKETT>你知道这个星期的名字吗
<31-23,BECKETT>Do you know this week's names?

877
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,600
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>不知道  但是格顿说名字出自他最喜欢的电影
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>No, but Gordon said they were from his favorite film

878
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,530
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>《马耳他之鹰》
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>"The Maltese Falcon."

879
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,960
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>-你就是个小偷  -什么  我是什么
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>- You're a sneak. - What? I'm a what?

880
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,490
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>我不在乎这些人会不会认出你
<31-24,MONICA WYATT>I don't care if these guys could've recognized you.

881
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,180
<32-1,ESPOSITO>要是再把他们留在这儿
<32-1,ESPOSITO>You hold 'em much longer,

882
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,980
<32-1,ESPOSITO>这里马上就会有另一起谋杀案了
<32-1,ESPOSITO>there's gonna be another murder on our hands.

883
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,390
<33-1,BECKETT>放轻松  我们马上就好了
<33-1,BECKETT>Relax. We're almost done.

884
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,320
<33-1,BECKETT>我们已经查了两家  还有两家
<33-1,BECKETT>We got two Nicks down, two to go.

885
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,490
<33-1,BECKETT>好吧  一会再打给你
<33-1,BECKETT>Okay. Call you in a bit.

886
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,300
<33-2,CASTLE>我在想我们是不是应该用
<33-2,CASTLE>I wonder if I should've used

887
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,840
<33-2,CASTLE>悉尼·格林斯特里特  英国著名演员

<33-2,CASTLE>Now there's a guy who loved his pizza.

890

<33-3,BECKETT>Well, we already put our money down on Bogie,

891

<33-3,BECKETT>我们就继续演下去吧
<33-3,BECKETT>So let's just play this through.

<34-5,CASTLE>把尸体放进烤箱听上去更像是你的主意
<34-5,CASTLE>Body in an oven sounds more like you're speed.

<34-10,SAL MALVOLTA>it was driving me crazy.

927

931
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,530
<34-13,CASTLE>但你知道那不会是一盘意式千层面
<34-13,CASTLE>Yeah, but you knew it wasn't a tray of lasagna.

963
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,060

<36-5,CASTLE>她女儿的凶手仅一步之遥  却没能成功

970
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,010
<36-10,BECKETT>所以希望至少有人能知道真相

<36-12,BECKETT>你说的对

<37-1,MONICA WYATT>我等一个多小时了
<37-1,MONICA WYATT>I have been waiting over an hour.

977
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,780
<37-2,BECKETT>这起案件最有趣的地方就是
<37-2,BECKETT>You know the funny thing about this case is that

978
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,230
<37-2,BECKETT>每个人都名不副实  包括你
<37-2,BECKETT>nobody is who they claim to be, not even you.

979
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,880
<37-3,CASTLE>莫妮卡·怀特  这里说
<37-3,CASTLE>Monica Wyatt--it says here

<37-5,BECKETT>扔到洛杉矶大河的瘾君子
<37-5,BECKETT>and then dumped in the L.A. River.

986
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,040
<37-6,CASTLE>六个月后
<37-6,CASTLE>Six months later,

987
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,900
<37-6,CASTLE>道上盛传一位新任的残暴的毒枭出现了
<37-6,CASTLE>word of a new and brutal kingpin started sweeping the streets.

988
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,520
<37-6,CASTLE>你是说那人是我吗
<37-6,CASTLE>And you're saying that's me?

989
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,820
<37-7,MONICA WYATT>我是个地产经纪人  你们不是见过我家吗
<37-7,MONICA WYATT>I'm a real estate agent. Have you seen my apartment?

<37-8,BECKETT>But all of the other ones can only be previewed online.

992
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,540
<37-9,MONICA WYATT>你是在说什么
<37-9,MONICA WYATT>What are you talking about?

993
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,340
<37-10,BECKETT>你的买家华特·尼夫  弗兰克·钱伯斯
<37-10,BECKETT>Your apartment sales to Walter Neff, Frank Chambers,

994
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,600
<37-10,BECKETT>理查德·哈兰德全是黑色电影里的角色
<37-10,BECKETT>Richard harland--they're all characters from noir films.

995
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,850
<37-10,BECKETT>都是虚构的
<37-10,BECKETT>They aren't real.

996
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,660
<37-10,BECKETT>你把上千万毒资
<37-10,BECKETT>You made millions in heroin holdings,

997
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,750
<37-10,BECKETT>都转化成了房地产投资
<37-10,BECKETT>which you turned into millions in real estate holdings,

998
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,740
<37-10,BECKETT>洗得一干二净
<37-10,BECKETT>All clean.

999
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,600
<37-11,CASTLE>而且你还一直
<37-11,CASTLE>All the while,

1000
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,560
<37-11,CASTLE>延续着卡瓦罗的罪恶传说
<37-11,CASTLE>perpetuating the myth of Cavallo.

1001
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,630
<37-12,MONICA WYATT>格顿不是死于追查传说
<37-12,MONICA WYATT>Gordon didn't die chasing a myth.

1002
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,640
<37-13,BECKETT>对了  格顿
<37-13,BECKETT>Oh, yeah, Gordon.

1003
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,060
<37-13,BECKETT>你倒是没全撒谎
<37-13,BECKETT>Well, there's something that you didn't completely lie about.

1004
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,040
<37-13,BECKETT>你们确实是几年前认识的
<37-13,BECKETT>You did meet him a couple of years ago,

1005
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,570
<37-13,BECKETT>但他不是你的男友
<37-13,BECKETT>but not as a boyfriend.

1006
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,790
<37-13,BECKETT>而是个知道得太多
<37-13,BECKETT>He was a pain-in-the-ass reporter

1007
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,880
<37-13,BECKETT>令人讨厌的记者
<37-13,BECKETT>that just kept getting a little too close.

1008
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,670
<37-14,CASTLE>直到无端端冲出一辆车  撞死了他的女儿
<37-14,CASTLE>Until a car came out of nowhere and killed his daughter.

1009
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,000
<37-15,BECKETT>这才使他好多年都没再纠缠你
<37-15,BECKETT>That got him out of your hair for a couple of years,

1010
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,300
<37-15,BECKETT>但后来他在披萨店又察觉到了你的踪迹
<37-15,BECKETT>but then he caught your scent again at Nick's Pizza.

1011
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,980
<37-16,CASTLE>这迫使你要斩草除根
<37-16,CASTLE>And that forced you to get rid of him permanently.

1012
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:00,780
<37-16,CASTLE>于是你就供出赫利  作为替罪羊
<37-16,CASTLE>And then you fed us Harley, the sacrificial lamb,

1013
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,770
<37-16,CASTLE>以转移我们的注意力
<37-16,CASTLE>to throw us off your trail.

1014
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,980
<37-16,CASTLE>赫利攻击了我
<37-16,CASTLE>Harley attacked me.

1015
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,760
<37-17,BECKETT>是啊  然后他从消防梯跑了
<37-17,BECKETT>Oh, yeah, and then he managed to run down the fire escape

1016
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,370
<37-17,BECKETT>快的难以置信
<37-17,BECKETT>with such incredible speed

1017
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,530
<37-17,BECKETT>两位全纽约最棒的警探
<37-17,BECKETT>that two of New York's finest detectives

1018
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,490
<37-17,BECKETT>连他影都没见着  抓他就更别想了
<37-17,BECKETT>were incapable of seeing him, never mind catching him.

1019
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,960
<37-18,CASTLE>苦肉计
<37-18,CASTLE>Beating yourself up...

1020
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,660
<37-18,CASTLE>这招不错
<37-18,CASTLE>was a nice touch.

1021
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,830
<37-18,CASTLE>我刚刚才意识到
<37-18,CASTLE>You know what I just realized

1022
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,790
<37-18,CASTLE>所有卡瓦罗挑选名字的那些电影
