<26-8,BECKETT>Sounds like you were kind of a mentor to him.

108
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,070
<6-1,CASTLE>不过是照顾自己人
<6-1,CASTLE>I was just looking out for my own.

109
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,940
<6-2,BECKETT>那昨晚你在泳池做什么
<6-2,BECKETT>So what were you doing at the pool last night?

110
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,780
<6-3,CASTLE>扎克说想练两把  我就想
<6-3,CASTLE>Zack said he wanted to run drills, and I figured,

111
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,640
<6-4,BECKETT>没搞错吧
<6-4,BECKETT>what the hell?

112
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,720
<6-5,CASTLE>我退役了  不常在水里训练
<6-5,CASTLE>Now that I'm retired, I don't do enough time in the water.

113
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,380
<6-5,CASTLE>但是我感觉他就是需要一个朋友
<6-5,CASTLE>But I think he really just needed a friend.

114
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,350
<3-1,LORRAINE DINOVI>为什么这么说
<3-1,LORRAINE DINOVI>Why is that?

115
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,820
<3-2,MONTGOMERY>他刚和他女朋友谈过
<3-2,MONTGOMERY>He just had the talk with his girl.

116
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,460
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>谈孩子是怎么生出来的吗
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>Where do babies come from?

117
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,130
<3-4,MONTGOMERY>不是谈那个
<3-4,MONTGOMERY>No, not that talk.

118
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,990
<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>而是像我还在维明顿的时候
<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>The one I had with my high school girlfriend

119
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,210
<15-5,TOMMY MARCONE>跟我女朋友谈的那种
<15-5,TOMMY MARCONE>back in Wilmington.

120
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,240
<15-6,BECKETT>如果想成为顶尖高手
<15-6,BECKETT>If you want to get to the top,

121
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,510
<15-7,TOMMY MARCONE>你就不能让任何人拖累你
<15-7,TOMMY MARCONE>you can't take everyone with you.

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,920
<5-2,BECKETT>有些人你必须放手
<5-2,BECKETT>So some people, you have to leave behind.

123
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,180
<4-1,BECKETT>-所以就得谈谈  -她如何应对的
<4-1,BECKETT>- So you have the talk. - And how did she handle that?

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,140
<4-2,MONTGOMERY>她挺伤心的  扎克也是
<4-2,MONTGOMERY>She took it hard. So did Zack.

125
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,010
<4-3,BECKETT>但他很担心她
<4-3,BECKETT>But he was worried about her,

126
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,330
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>担心她会做出什么傻事
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>worried that she might do something stupid.

127
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,780
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>你还记得她名字吗
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>Do you remember her name?

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,200
<2-43,BECKETT>你昨晚什么时候离开泳池的
<2-43,BECKETT>And what time did you leave the pool last night?

130
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,580
<2-44,BECKETT>刚过午夜
<2-44,BECKETT>A little after midnight.

131
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,700
<2-45,BECKETT>你早上一点到五点在哪里
<2-45,BECKETT>Where were you between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m.?

132
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
<8-11,RYAN>和广告代理商的一些人在菩萨酒吧
<8-11,RYAN>At Buddha Bar with half the ad agency.

133
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,160
<8-12,BECKETT>我们一直玩到天亮
<8-12,BECKETT>We partied till dawn.

<8-13,RYAN>到你了  火箭
<8-13,RYAN>We're ready for you, Rocket.

<2-46,PHOTOGRAPHER>Hell of a day to sell cologne.

137

<2-47,CASTLE>你在看什么
<2-47,CASTLE>What were you looking at?

138
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,970
<2-48,BECKETT>没什么
<2-48,BECKETT>Nothing.

<2-48,BECKETT>我第一次带他去泳池的时候  他才两岁
<2-48,BECKETT>First day I put him in the pool, he was 2 years old.

140
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,190
<3-1,LORRAINE DINOVI>他就像条鱼一样
<3-1,LORRAINE DINOVI>Took to it like a fish.

141
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,830

<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>这是我们该做的  对吧
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>It's what we do for them, right?

144
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,000
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>他爸走了之后
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>When his dad left

145
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,930
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>当我感觉万念俱灰的时候
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>and I was feeling lower than dirt,

146
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,210
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>你知道他和我说了什么吗
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>you know what he told me?

147
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,960
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>他说"为了你  我总有一天会成名"  妈
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>He said, "I'm gonna be someone one day for you, Ma,

148
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,920
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>这样你在大街上走也能为我骄傲
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>so you can walk down the street and be proud."

149
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,590
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>是谁干的
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>Who did this?

150
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,890
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>是谁杀了我的儿子
<3-3,LORRAINE DINOVI>Who killed my son?

151

<3-4,MONTGOMERY>布丽吉特·麦克马尼斯的事吗
<3-4,MONTGOMERY>about Bridget McManus?

154

<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>她和扎克从高中开始就在一起了
<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>Her and Zack have been an item since high school.

155
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,420
<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>这和布丽吉特有什么关系吗
<3-5,LORRAINE DINOVI>What's this got to do with Bridget?

156
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,130
<3-6,MONTGOMERY>可能没什么  我们只是要确认每个细节
<3-6,MONTGOMERY>Maybe nothing, we're just checking everywhere.

157
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,420
<3-6,MONTGOMERY>他有提起过别的吗  有没有什么麻烦
<3-6,MONTGOMERY>Did he mention anything else, any trouble he might be in?

158
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,670
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>扎克知道什么是麻烦  他从来不参与其中
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>Zack knew what trouble was. He wanted no part of it.

159
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,990
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>我们这儿的人很难走出去
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>People don't get out of our neighborhood.

160
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,430
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>扎克就要成功了
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>Zack was gonna make it.

161
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,920
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>我的宝贝  他马上就要成功了
<3-7,LORRAINE DINOVI>My baby, he was going to make it.

162
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,020
<4-1,BECKETT>队长
<4-1,BECKETT>Captain.

163
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,650
<4-2,MONTGOMERY>那是扎克的母亲
<4-2,MONTGOMERY>Zack's mom.

164
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,690
<4-3,BECKETT>有关于女朋友的线索吗
<4-3,BECKETT>Anything about the girlfriend?

165
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,710
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>她不知道
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>Not that she knows of.

166
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,070
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>在她看来一切都好
<4-4,MONTGOMERY>She seemed to think everything was okay.

167
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,880
<4-5,RYAN>有很多事他都没和他妈说
<4-5,RYAN>Ah, then there was a lot he wasn't sharing.

168
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,400
<4-5,RYAN>看看布丽吉特在扎克遇害的那个晚上
<4-5,RYAN>Check out the text messages that Bridget fired off to Zack

169
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,720
<4-5,RYAN>给他发的短信
<4-5,RYAN>on the night he was killed.

170
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,060
<4-6,CASTLE>看上去可不太愉快
<4-6,CASTLE>Ooh. Not a lot of "LOLs" in there.

171
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
<4-7,BECKETT>"扎克  如果你离开我
<4-7,BECKETT>"Zack, if you leave me,

<4-7,BECKETT>我对天发誓  我会杀了你"
<4-7,BECKETT>I swear to god, I'll kill you."

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,090
<4-8,CASTLE>看来她挺毒舌的
<4-8,CASTLE>She has a way with words.

174
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,120
<4-9,BECKETT>而且还有犯罪记录
<4-9,BECKETT>And a record to go with it.

<4-10,RYAN>行为不检  大多不严重
<4-10,RYAN>Disorderly conduct. Mostly minor stuff.

176
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,220
<4-10,RYAN>警员正在把她带过来
<4-10,RYAN>Uniforms are bringing her in now.

177
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,400
<4-11,MONTGOMERY>这里说她只有5英尺2英寸[约1米6]
<4-11,MONTGOMERY>It says here she's 5'2".

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,780
<4-11,MONTGOMERY>你觉得她真的能够制服扎克吗
<4-11,MONTGOMERY>You really think she could overpower zack?

179
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,540
<4-12,RYAN>不  但是她兄弟可以
<4-12,RYAN>Uh, no, but her brothers could.

180
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,410
<4-12,RYAN>和大多数爱尔兰人一样  她有四个兄弟
<4-12,RYAN>In grand Irish tradition, she has four of them,

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,060

<4-12,RYAN>each over 6 foot, each with his own claim to fame--

187
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,360
<4-21,CASTLE>那个不算
<4-21,CASTLE>Doesn't count.

190

<4-25,BECKETT>查出她几个兄弟在早上1点和5点之间
<4-25,BECKETT>All right, find out where her brothers were

191
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,580
<4-25,BECKETT>都在哪里
<4-25,BECKETT>between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m.

<4-25,BECKETT>谢谢  长官
<4-25,BECKETT>Thank you, sir.

194
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,940
<5-1,BRIDGET MCMANUS>杀了他
<5-1,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Kill him?

195
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,270
<5-1,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我从九年级开始就爱着扎克·林赛
<5-1,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I've loved Zack Lindsey since the ninth grade.

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,400
<5-2,BECKETT>那你的示爱方式很有趣
<5-2,BECKETT>You have a funny way of showing it.

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,720
<5-2,BECKETT>我只是很生气
<5-2,BECKETT>I was pissed.

198
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,400
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>五年了  是我帮他做的清蒸鸡胸肉
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>For five years, I cooked his steamed chicken breast,

199
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,220
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>每天凌晨1点前  是我把他的通心粉
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I put his pasta in the tupperware

200
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,810
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>放进饭盒里  是我在健身房陪着他
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>before 1:00 in the morning, I kept him company at the gym.

201
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,870
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>然后他告诉我"对不起  布丽吉特
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>And then he tells me, "Sorry, Bridge.

202
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,030
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我不能受到其他干扰"
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I can't have any other voices in my head."

203
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,070
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>好像突然之间  我让他心烦意乱了
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Like suddenly, I'm a distraction.

205
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>突然之间  我配不上科泉市了吗
<5-3,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Like suddenly, I'm not good enough for Colorado Springs?

206
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,020
<5-4,CASTLE>所以你就威胁要杀了他  除非跟你和好
<5-4,CASTLE>So you threatened to kill him unless he took you back?

207
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,970
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我就是这么说话的  行不
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>No, that's how I talk, okay?

208
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,410
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>但的确有事情不对劲
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>But there was something going on.

209
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,600
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>和游泳一点关系都没有
<5-5,BRIDGET MCMANUS>And it had nothing to do with swimming.

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,730
<5-6,BECKETT>你什么意思
<5-6,BECKETT>What do you mean?

211
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,790
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>最近他焦虑不安  还神神秘秘的
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Lately, he had been stressed, secretive.

212
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,640
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>还有他还说"我的时代来了"
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Add that to him saying, "This is my time,"

213
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,760
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>还有那些多金的大学女孩看他的样子
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>and the way those rich college girls looked at him.

214
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,770
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我不是小孩  我猜得出来
<5-7,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I wasn't born yesterday. I can do the math.

215
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,200
<5-8,BECKETT>你觉得他有外遇了
<5-8,BECKETT>You thought there was someone else.

216
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
<5-8,BECKETT>没错
<5-8,BECKETT>Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,160
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>于是有天晚上他出了公寓  我就跟踪了他
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>So I followed him out of his apartment the other night,

218
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,200
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>准备去揍扁某个康涅狄格州的大贱人
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>ready to fight some queen bitch from Connecticut.

219
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,570
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>抢回我男人  不过他见的不是女孩
<5-9,BRIDGET MCMANUS>For what's mine, only it wasn't another girl.

220
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,490
<5-10,BECKETT>那是谁
<5-10,BECKETT>Well, who was it?

221
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,830
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我不知道  一个长得挺吓人的家伙
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I don't know. Some scary looking guy.

222
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,320
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>他们在地铁站碰了头
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>They met under the L,

223
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,250
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>就开始大喊大叫
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>and they went at it, yelling and screaming.

224
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,470
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>那个家伙有口音
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>I couldn't tell about what, though,

225
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,920
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>所以我听不出他们在讲什么
<5-11,BRIDGET MCMANUS>'cause the guy had, like, an accent.

226
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,000
<5-12,CASTLE>什么样的口音  西班牙  亚洲  俄罗斯
<5-12,CASTLE>What kind of accent-- Spanish, Asian, Russian?

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,680
<5-13,BRIDGET MCMANUS>我看上去像是在联合国的人吗
<5-13,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Do I look like I work at the U.N.?

228
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,560
<5-13,BRIDGET MCMANUS>反正不是布鲁克林的口音
<5-13,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Not Brooklyn, okay?

229
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,950
<5-14,CASTLE>好的  不
<5-14,CASTLE>Okay. No...

230
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,650
<5-15,BRIDGET MCMANUS>总之  我事后问过扎克
<5-15,BRIDGET MCMANUS>Anyways, I asked Zack about it afterwards,

231
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,370
<5-15,BRIDGET MCMANUS>他说没什么  但肯定有什么事
<5-15,BRIDGET MCMANUS>and he said it was nothing, but it wasn't.

232
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,300
<5-16,BECKETT>你能向我们的画像师描述一下这个人吗
<5-16,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe this guy to our sketch artist?

233
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,020
<5-17,BECKETT>蕾妮确定了他体内没有药物
<5-17,BECKETT>So Lanie confirms no drug in his system,

234
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,210
<5-17,BECKETT>或者兴奋剂什么的
<5-17,BECKETT>performance-enhancing or otherwise.

235
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,150
<5-17,BECKETT>从他血液内高浓度的氯离子来看
<5-17,BECKETT>And from the high levels of chloride ion in his blood,

236
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,110
<5-17,BECKETT>她能肯定那些灼伤是因为氯
<5-17,BECKETT>she is sure that the burns came from chlorine.

237
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,550
<5-18,CASTLE>我们有着重口音的凶手
<5-18,CASTLE>Hmm. So our heavily accented killer

238
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,840
<5-18,CASTLE>用沾满氯水的布将扎克弄晕了
<5-18,CASTLE>rendered Zack unconscious with a chlorine-soaked rag.

239
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,990
<5-19,BECKETT>我们不确定他就是凶手
<5-19,BECKETT>We don't know that he's a killer.

240
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,780
<5-20,CASTLE>这是一个无辜的人的脸吗
<5-20,CASTLE>Is this the face of an innocent man?

241
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,920
<5-20,CASTLE>他在被害人被杀前一晚
<5-20,CASTLE>He had a heated argument with our victim

242
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,120
<5-20,CASTLE>和他有过激烈的争执
<5-20,CASTLE>the night before he was killed.

243
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,830
<5-21,BECKETT>那他的动机又会是什么呢
<5-21,BECKETT>And what would his motive be exactly?

244
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,870
<5-22,CASTLE>他...如果...
<5-22,CASTLE>He... If...

245
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,500
<5-23,ESPOSITO>我或许有点线索
<5-23,ESPOSITO>I... may have a line on that.

246
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
<5-23,ESPOSITO>我查了一下扎克的财务状况
<5-23,ESPOSITO>I'm looking at Zack's financials.

247
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,830
<5-23,ESPOSITO>这个家伙只得到了部分奖学金
<5-23,ESPOSITO>The guy only had a partial scholarship.

248
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,250
<5-23,ESPOSITO>他仍付得起大多数学费
<5-23,ESPOSITO>He still paid for most of his tuition,

249
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,200
<5-23,ESPOSITO>书本费还有生活费
<5-23,ESPOSITO>books, and living expenses,

250
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,230
<5-23,ESPOSITO>都没有依靠学生贷款
<5-23,ESPOSITO>all without taking student loans.

251
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,130
<5-23,ESPOSITO>他没有工作  而他妈也只能勉强度日
<5-23,ESPOSITO>He didn't have a job, and his mom was just squeaking by.

252
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,510
<5-24,CASTLE>全国大学体育协会的规定
<5-24,CASTLE>And NCAA rules

253
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,900
<5-24,CASTLE>禁止他接受除了他家庭之外
<5-24,CASTLE>preclude him from receiving any financial assistance

254
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,360
<5-24,CASTLE>的任何经济支助
<5-24,CASTLE>from outside his family.

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
<5-25,ESPOSITO>那他从哪里搞到的钱
<5-25,ESPOSITO>So where did he get that money?

256
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,470
<5-26,CASTLE>也许他从错误的人那里
<5-26,CASTLE>You think maybe he borrowed money from the wrong guys

257
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,490
<5-26,CASTLE>借钱来资助他的梦想
<5-26,CASTLE>to finance his dream?

258
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,650
<5-27,ESPOSITO>然后他还不了钱
<5-27,ESPOSITO>And when he couldn't make the payments,

259
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
<5-27,ESPOSITO>他们就解决了他
<5-27,ESPOSITO>they came after him.

260
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,570
<5-28,CASTLE>这就能解释那场争吵了
<5-28,CASTLE>That would explain the argument.

261
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,760
<5-29,BECKETT>-埃斯波西托  -我们都不知道有没有那场争吵
<5-29,BECKETT>- Esposito. - We don't even know that there was an argument,

262
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,280
<5-29,BECKETT>我们唯一的证据就是布丽吉特声称
<5-29,BECKETT>and the only evidence we have is a sketch of a man

263
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,200
<5-29,BECKETT>她看到的男人的画像
<5-29,BECKETT>that Bridget claims she saw.

264
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,890
<5-30,ESPOSITO>好的  谢了
<5-30,ESPOSITO>All right, thanks.

265
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,840
<5-30,ESPOSITO>警员们到扎克家了
<5-30,ESPOSITO>Uniforms just got to Zack's place.

266
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,050
<5-30,ESPOSITO>那看起来像被扫荡过一样
<5-30,ESPOSITO>Looks like it's been tossed.

267
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,760
<6-1,CASTLE>这里就像我的第一个公寓
<6-1,CASTLE>This place looks like my first apartment.

268
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,410
<6-1,CASTLE>我们还举行过蟑螂赛跑
<6-1,CASTLE>We used to have cockroach races.

269
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,880
<6-1,CASTLE>不知道卡夫卡的灵感是否来自于此
<6-1,CASTLE>Wonder if that's how Kafka got the idea.

270
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,680
<6-1,CASTLE>看来扎克并不做家务啊
<6-1,CASTLE>Looks like Zack didn't do his chores.

271
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,170
<6-2,BECKETT>扎克遇害接着他家就被翻过
<6-2,BECKETT>Zack was killed and then his place gets trashed?

272
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,500
<6-2,BECKETT>这绝不是巧合
<6-2,BECKETT>Not a coincidence.

273
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,150
<6-3,CASTLE>你觉得这和讨债有关系吗
<6-3,CASTLE>You think maybe this was part of a debt collection effort?

274
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,450
<6-4,BECKETT>那怎么没把电视机和笔记本电脑带走
<6-4,BECKETT>Well, then why'd they leave the tv and the laptop?

275
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,530
<6-5,CASTLE>或者医疗器械
<6-5,CASTLE>Or the medical supplies.

276
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,410
<6-5,CASTLE>剔牙钳
<6-5,CASTLE>Dental pick.

277
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,600
<6-5,CASTLE>你觉得齿菌斑会让你游不快吗
<6-5,CASTLE>You think plaque slows you down in the water?

278
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,970
<6-6,BECKETT>他们是有目的性的翻找
<6-6,BECKETT>They were looking for something specific.

279
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,390
<6-6,BECKETT>除非其他地方都找过了
<6-6,BECKETT>You don't rip through a mattress

280
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,900
<6-6,BECKETT>否则不会还把床垫扯开来找
<6-6,BECKETT>unless you've run out of places to look.

281
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,430
<6-6,BECKETT>他们可能没找到想要的东西
<6-6,BECKETT>Maybe they didn't find what they were looking for.

282
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,390
<6-7,CASTLE>那东西可能还在这  只是藏得太好了
<6-7,CASTLE>Maybe it's still here, but it's just too well hidden.

283
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,310
<6-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<6-8,BECKETT>What?

284
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,220
<6-9,BECKETT>药物吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Medication?

285
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,690
<6-10,CASTLE>就我所知  只有一样东西
<6-10,CASTLE>Only one thing I know of

286
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,260
<6-10,CASTLE>是装在这种管形瓶里的
<6-10,CASTLE>comes in little vials like that.

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,070
<6-10,CASTLE>合成代谢类固醇
<6-10,CASTLE>Anabolic steroids.

288
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,520
<6-11,BECKETT>扎克没有服药
<6-11,BECKETT>Zack's clean.

289
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,970
<6-11,BECKETT>他怎么会有类固醇呢
<6-11,BECKETT>Why would he have steroids?

290
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,700
<6-12,CASTLE>也许他没有我们想象的那么干净
<6-12,CASTLE>Maybe he's not as clean as we thought.

293

294
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,730
<7-1,LANIE>是类固醇没错
<7-1,LANIE>Yep, it's steroids all right.

295
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,950
<7-2,BECKETT>我记得你说过扎克并没有服用类固醇
<7-2,BECKETT>I thought you said Zack wasn't using steroids.

296
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,060
<7-3,LANIE>-测试检测不出来这个  -为什么
<7-3,LANIE>- The test wouldn't pick up stuff like this. - Why not?

297
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,350
<7-4,CASTLE>它里面含有掩蔽剂就是为躲过测试
<7-4,CASTLE>It's loaded with masking agents and designed to beat the test--

298
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,800
<7-5,LANIE>几乎找不到  除非你特意检测
<7-5,LANIE>virtually untraceable unless you look for it specifically.

299
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,960
<7-6,BECKETT>-所以他有服用这个  -没有
<7-6,BECKETT>- So he was using. - Nope.

300
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,520
<7-7,LANIE>我也针对这个做了测试
<7-7,LANIE>I went back and tested for this, too.

301
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,160
<7-7,LANIE>他没在服用任何类固醇
<7-7,LANIE>Your boy is steroid-free.

302
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,500
<7-8,BECKETT>如果他不用
<7-8,BECKETT>Well, if he wasn't using steroids,

303
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,200
<7-8,BECKETT>那怎么会有这些类固醇
<7-8,BECKETT>then what was he doing with them?

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,840
<7-9,CASTLE>几乎检测不到吗
<7-9,CASTLE>Virtually undetectable?

305
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,280
<7-9,CASTLE>这种药都哪来的
<7-9,CASTLE>Where does a drug like that come from?

306
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
<7-10,LANIE>有传言说
<7-10,LANIE>There's been some talk about

307
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,020
<7-10,LANIE>有种来自东欧某处的新药
<7-10,LANIE>a new beat-the-test performance-enhancing drug

308
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,070
<7-10,LANIE>能让人成绩提升而且检验不出来
<7-10,LANIE>being developed somewhere in eastern Europe.

309
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,710
<7-11,CASTLE>东欧...
<7-11,CASTLE>Eastern Europe...

310
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,110
<7-11,CASTLE>口音不明者的故乡
<7-11,CASTLE>Home of the hard-to-identify accent.

311
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,570
<8-1,BECKETT>想想大家都说扎克很优秀
<8-1,BECKETT>Given how great everyone says Zack was,

312
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,140
<8-1,BECKETT>这些类固醇的存在说不通啊
<8-1,BECKETT>this whole steroids thing just doesn't make sense.

313
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,590
<8-2,CASTLE>他需要钱
<8-2,CASTLE>Well, we know he needed the money.

314
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,680
<8-2,CASTLE>如果他不用  就是拿来卖
<8-2,CASTLE>If he wasn't using, maybe he was dealing.

315
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,730
<8-3,ESPOSITO>这些肯定能给他足够的现金
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Well, that definitely would've given him the cash needed

316
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,750
<8-3,ESPOSITO>维持收支平衡
<8-3,ESPOSITO>to make ends meet.

317
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,050
<8-4,BECKETT>可他只有这么一点
<8-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but he only had a couple of vials.

318
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,570
<8-5,CASTLE>也许他现在是存货偏低的时候
<8-5,CASTLE>Maybe he was low on inventory,

319
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,580
<8-5,CASTLE>和扎克争吵的那个男人
<8-5,CASTLE>and the man Zack was arguing with,

320
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,810
<8-5,CASTLE>我们神秘的斯拉夫人是个分销商
<8-5,CASTLE>our secretive Slav, he was the distributor.

321
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,230
<8-6,BECKETT>前提是那男人真的存在
<8-6,BECKETT>If there even was a man.

322
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,100
<8-6,BECKETT>据我们所知  布丽吉特在说谎
<8-6,BECKETT>For all we know, Bridget was lying.

323
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,890
<8-7,RYAN>关于她兄弟  她说的是实话
<8-7,RYAN>Well, she wasn't lying about her brothers.

324
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,060
<8-7,RYAN>我和他们四个谈过了
<8-7,RYAN>I talked to all four of them,

325
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,250
<8-7,RYAN>爱尔兰裔男人间的交谈
<8-7,RYAN>one Irishman to another and another.

326
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,000
<8-7,RYAN>总之  他们的不在场证明都成立
<8-7,RYAN>Anyway, they alibied out.

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,860
<8-7,RYAN>扎克遇害的时候他们在新帕尔茨
<8-7,RYAN>They were in New Paltz when Zack was killed.

328
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,540
<8-8,BECKETT>-全部吗  -没错
<8-8,BECKETT>- All of them? - Mm-hmm.

329
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,770
<8-10,BECKETT>在那干嘛
<8-10,BECKETT>For what?

330
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,910
<8-11,RYAN>他们在参加某种运动
<8-11,RYAN>They were at a sporting event of a... sorts.

331
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,640
<8-12,BECKETT>这种运动是...
<8-12,BECKETT>Which was?

332
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,210
<8-13,RYAN>小矮妖投掷游戏  别问了
<8-13,RYAN>Leprechaun toss. Don't ask.

333
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,990
<8-13,RYAN>反正  年长的得了第一
<8-13,RYAN>Anyway, the, uh, older brother, he got first place.

334
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,260
<8-14,RYAN>老天...
<8-14,RYAN>Oh, man.

335
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,540
<8-15,CASTLE>暂且不去吐槽爱尔兰文化的优点...
<8-15,CASTLE>Well, the merits of Irish culture aside...

336
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,770
<8-16,RYAN>-喂  -抱歉
<8-16,RYAN>- Hey! - Sorry.

337
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,310
<8-17,CASTLE>或许这说明了关于神秘的爱沙尼亚人
<8-17,CASTLE>Perhaps this suggests that Bridget was telling the truth

338
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,940
<8-17,CASTLE>布丽吉特说的是实话
<8-17,CASTLE>about our elusive Estonian.

339
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,030
<8-18,RYAN>我把素描图传给缉毒组和扫黄组
<8-18,RYAN>I'll run the sketch past narco and vice,

340
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,020
<8-18,RYAN>看是否有人认出他
<8-18,RYAN>see if they recognize him.

341
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,960
<8-19,BECKETT>再看看他们是否在留意扎克
<8-19,BECKETT>Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar.

342
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,170
<8-19,BECKETT>埃斯波西托  你和扎克的队友们谈下
<8-19,BECKETT>And, Esposito, can you talk to Zack's teammates

343
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,900
<8-19,BECKETT>类固醇的事  看看他们知道些什么
<8-19,BECKETT>about the steroids, find out what they knew?

344
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,350
<9-1,AARON CHOI>扎克不会碰类固醇
<9-1,AARON CHOI>Zack would never touch steroids.

345
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,230
<9-1,AARON CHOI>我们都不会这么做
<9-1,AARON CHOI>None of us would.

346
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,340
<9-2,ESPOSITO>事实是
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Look, the fact of the matter is,

347
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,840
<9-2,ESPOSITO>扎克没在用
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Zack was clean,

348
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,000
<9-2,ESPOSITO>可我们在他房间找到了类固醇
<9-2,ESPOSITO>but we found steroids at his place.

349
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,790
<9-2,ESPOSITO>我们只想知道为什么
<9-2,ESPOSITO>We're just trying to figure out why.

350
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,480
<9-3,BRIAN MORRIS>你是在说扎克卖那些东西吗
<9-3,BRIAN MORRIS>Are you saying you think Zack was a dealer?

351
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,890
<9-4,AARON CHOI>他死了还不够
<9-4,AARON CHOI>Look, it's not enough that he's dead.

352
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,360
<9-4,AARON CHOI>你还打算给他抹黑吗
<9-4,AARON CHOI>Now you gotta drag him through the mud?

353
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,430
<9-4,AARON CHOI>我给你说说扎克·林赛好了
<9-4,AARON CHOI>Let me tell you something about Zack Lindsey.

354
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,040
<9-4,AARON CHOI>他是这个队伍的核心和灵魂人物
<9-4,AARON CHOI>He was the heart and soul of this team.

355
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,780
<9-4,AARON CHOI>是我们的榜样
<9-4,AARON CHOI>He was the person we wanted to be.

356
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,870
<9-4,AARON CHOI>如果你有发现药物  肯定是别的原因
<9-4,AARON CHOI>So if you found drugs, they were there for another reason.

357
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,620
<9-4,AARON CHOI>不管什么理由  他肯定图谋不轨
<9-4,AARON CHOI>Whatever the reason, he was up to something.

358
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,160
<10-1,CASTLE>他三个邻居说
<10-1,CASTLE>Statements from three of his neighbors say that

359
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,430
<10-1,CASTLE>他外出后彻夜不归
<10-1,CASTLE>he was going out and staying out all night.

360
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,700
<10-2,BECKETT>是去游泳池训练  这是我们已知的事实
<10-2,BECKETT>Yes, to the pool to train. We already know that.

361
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,130
<10-3,CASTLE>但有一半时间  他没带运动包就出门了
<10-3,CASTLE>Except half the time, he was leaving without his gym bag,

362
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,850
<10-3,CASTLE>那他是去哪儿了
<10-3,CASTLE>so where was he going?

363
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,220
<10-4,BECKETT>我希望你是已经有了答案
<10-4,BECKETT>I'm hoping that you're asking that just for effect

364
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,840
<10-4,BECKETT>为做效果才这么问的
<10-4,BECKETT>because you already have an answer.

365
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,450
<10-5,CASTLE>我不知道
<10-5,CASTLE>I-I got nothing.

366
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,300
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>也许你查错了方向
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>Maybe you're looking at it wrong.

367
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,830
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>类固醇可能和这起谋杀没关系
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>Maybe the steroids have nothing to do with his murder.

368
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,310
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>它们只是在干扰你的调查方向
<10-6,ALEX CONRAD>Maybe they're your red herring.

369
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,310
<10-7,CASTLE>艾利克斯  你来了我很高兴
<10-7,CASTLE>Alex, so glad you made it.

370
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,170
<10-7,CASTLE>艾利克斯·康拉德  来见见贝克特探长
<10-7,CASTLE>Alex Conrad, please meet Detective Beckett.

371
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,800
<10-7,CASTLE>贝克特探长  这位是我门生艾利克斯·康拉德
<10-7,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, Alex Conrad, my protégé.

372
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,790
<10-8,BECKETT>很高兴见到你
<10-8,BECKETT>Nice to meet you.

373
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,110
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>是我的荣幸才对  探长
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>It's a real pleasure, detective.

374
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,080
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>我读过好多次《希特热浪》和《赤裸热浪》
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>I have read "Heat wave" And "Naked heat" so many times,

375
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,220
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>觉得自己很了解你...
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>I feel like I know you--

376
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,290
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>你的聪明才智  美丽自信
<10-9,ALEX CONRAD>the piercing intelligence, the self-assured beauty.

377
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,770
<10-10,BECKETT>谢谢你的称赞
<10-10,BECKETT>Oh, um, thank you.

378
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,810
<10-10,BECKETT>你刚说类固醇什么
<10-10,BECKETT>Uh, so what were you saying about the steroids?

379
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,760
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>没什么特别的
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>Well, nothing really.

380
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,910
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>我只是看着白板  注意到
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>I was just looking at the board, and I noticed

381
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,360
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>这游泳的孩子和类固醇  仿佛是两个世界的事
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>that this swimmer kid, he's caught between two worlds.

382
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,040
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>如果是在写小说
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>Now if were writing the story,

383
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,110
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>类固醇是用来分散注意力的
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>the steroids would just be a red herring,

384
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,290
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>而真正的凶手
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>and the real killer

385
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,070
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>是以前的街坊邻居
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>would be someone from the old neighborhood.

386
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,090
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>但这只是我的想法
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>Uh, yeah. But, hey, that's just me.

387
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,090
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>在这方面我还是个新手
<10-11,ALEX CONRAD>Clearly I'm new at this.

388
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,340
<10-12,CASTLE>别担心  艾利克斯  这需要时间来积累经验
<10-12,CASTLE>Alex, don't worry. It takes years of experience--

389
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,220
<10-13,BECKETT>不会  你是对的  我们没有证据
<10-13,BECKETT>No. No, you're right. We don't have any proof

390
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,470
<10-13,BECKETT>把他和类固醇联系起来
<10-13,BECKETT>that his has anything to do with the steroids.

391
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,730
<10-13,BECKETT>这一切都是我们的假设
<10-13,BECKETT>We've just been assuming.

392
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,050
<10-13,BECKETT>我们的确也要深入了解下扎克的街坊邻居
<10-13,BECKETT>We do need to look into zack's old neighborhood as well.

393
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,210
<10-14,ALEX CONRAD>你说真的  我帮上忙了吗
<10-14,ALEX CONRAD>Seriously? I was helpful?

394
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,210
<10-15,BECKETT>是啊  你帮上忙了
<10-15,BECKETT>Yes. Yes, you were.

395
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,380
<10-16,CASTLE>是的  你大概有很多问题吧
<10-16,CASTLE>Yes, but you probably have lots of questions,

396
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,810
<10-16,CASTLE>所以我们该走了
<10-16,CASTLE>so we should get going.

397
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,150
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>如果这样不会越界的话
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>Hey, uh, if it's not overstepping,

398
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,030
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>就是为了让我的描写贴近现实  我在想
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>just in the interest of keeping it real, I was wondering

399
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,540
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>能问你几个问题吗
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>if I could ask you a few questions

400
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,100
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>是为了我《必死无疑》里的案子
<10-17,ALEX CONRAD>for the case I'm coming up with for "Seriously Dead".

401
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,440
<10-18,BECKETT>等你们俩谈完了
<10-18,BECKETT>Why don't you just give me a buzz

402
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,700
<10-18,BECKETT>给我打电话吧
<10-18,BECKETT>when the two of you are done?

403
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,760
<10-19,ALEX CONRAD>-要是你不介意的话  -怎么会呢
<10-19,ALEX CONRAD>- I mean, if it's okay with you. - Why wouldn't it be okay?

<11-1,CASTLE>It's so not okay. After everything I've done for him,

406
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,860
<11-1,CASTLE>他却要偷走我的缪斯
<11-1,CASTLE>he goes and tries to steal my Muse.

407
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,650
<11-2,ALEXIS>盗窃缪斯罪  怎么惩戒这样的罪恶呢
<11-2,ALEXIS>Muse thievery. What's the punishment for that,

408
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,660
<11-2,ALEXIS>在神话监狱关他个五到十年吗
<11-2,ALEXIS>five to ten in mythology jail?

409
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
<11-3,CASTLE>你们就笑吧
<11-3,CASTLE>Yes, you laugh.

410
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,610
<11-3,CASTLE>笑吧  尽情地笑吧
<11-3,CASTLE>Go ahead. Laugh all you want.

411

<11-8,MARTHA>- Oh. - Yes.

418
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,420
<11-9,CASTLE>我还以为是对我的褒扬呢  才不是呢
<11-9,CASTLE>I thought it was a compliment, but, no.

419
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,490
<11-9,CASTLE>-他是想取代我  -你要干嘛呀

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:25,470
<11-11,CASTLE>把我对《千真万确》的溢美之词撤下来
<11-11,CASTLE>I am going to remove my glowing review of "Dead Serious",

422
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,820
<11-11,CASTLE>换成《希特崛起》的封面
<11-11,CASTLE>and replace it with cover art for "Heat Rises".

423
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,130
<11-12,ALEXIS>-那个忘恩负义龌龊小人  -老爸  你不觉得
<11-12,ALEXIS>- That ungrateful little weasel... - Dad, you ever think

424
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,870
<11-12,ALEXIS>你有点反应过激了吗
<11-12,ALEXIS>that maybe you're overreacting a teensy bit?

425
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,140
<11-12,ALEXIS>你有没有想过他可能是太崇拜你了
<11-12,ALEXIS>You ever think that maybe he admires you so much

426
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,010
<11-12,ALEXIS>跟贝克特在一起也是为了进一步了解你呢
<11-12,ALEXIS>that spending time with Beckett is to understand you better?

427
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,490
<11-13,CASTLE>别用你的理性来扰乱我
<11-13,CASTLE>Don't confuse me with your reasonableness.

428
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,820
<11-14,ALEXIS>我就是想说
<11-14,ALEXIS>I'm just saying...

429
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,980
<11-14,ALEXIS>或许他不是你想的那种穷凶极恶夺人缪斯的人
<11-14,ALEXIS>maybe he's not the nefarious Muse-snatcher you think he is.

430
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,510
<11-14,ALEXIS>或许你该给人家个机会
<11-14,ALEXIS>Maybe you should give him a chance.

431
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
<11-15,CASTLE>或许
<11-15,CASTLE>Maybe...

432
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,130
<11-15,CASTLE>你是对的
<11-15,CASTLE>you're right.

433
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,820
<12-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢你的配合
<12-1,BECKETT>Okay, great. Thank you for your cooperation.

434
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,160
<12-1,BECKETT>谢谢
<12-1,BECKETT>Thank you.

435
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,380
<12-2,BECKETT>布丽吉特·麦克马尼斯说
<12-2,BECKETT>So Bridget McManus says that

436
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,370
<12-2,BECKETT>扎克早就不跟本森赫斯特那帮人混了
<12-2,BECKETT>Zack didn't really run with the Bensonhurst crowd anymore,

437
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,300
<12-2,BECKETT>不过她给了我一份名单
<12-2,BECKETT>but she did give me a list

438
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,190
<12-2,BECKETT>列出了他以前所有邻居伙伴
<12-2,BECKETT>of all of his old neighborhood buddies.

439
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,770
<12-3,ESPOSITO>-我来查查吧  -好呀
<12-3,ESPOSITO>- Oh, how about I run it down? - Yeah, great.

440
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,220
<12-5,ESPOSITO>好
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

441
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,220
<12-6,CASTLE>小松糕啊
<12-6,CASTLE>Muffins.

442
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,500
<12-7,BECKETT>艾利克斯·康拉德送给我的
<12-7,BECKETT>Alex Conrad sent them to me.

443
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,780
<12-8,CASTLE>艾利克斯
<12-8,CASTLE>Alex.

445
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,670
<12-9,CASTLE>"昨晚的事多谢了"
<12-9,CASTLE>"Thanks for last night."

446
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,230
<12-9,CASTLE>那么说你们俩昨晚小聚了
<12-9,CASTLE>Guess you two got together last night.

447
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,060
<12-10,BECKETT>是啊  我们谈了有关办案程序的问题
<12-10,BECKETT>Yeah, we talked about procedure.

448
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,170
<12-11,CASTLE>那就是  没什么特别的事了
<12-11,CASTLE>Oh, so... nothing special.

449
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,030
<12-11,CASTLE>说不准
<12-11,CASTLE>I don't know.

450
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,240
<12-12,BECKETT>他说会把学到的用在他下一本书里
<12-12,BECKETT>He said he was gonna use it all for his next book,

451
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,860
<12-12,BECKETT>-还说下次想谈谈案子  -还有下次
<12-12,BECKETT>- said next time he wants to talk about cases. - Next time?

452
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,870
<12-14,RYAN>我查到一些被害人的事情
<12-14,RYAN>So something came up on our victim.

453
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,890
<12-14,RYAN>-不知道该怎么解释  -是关于类固醇的吗
<12-14,RYAN>- Not sure what to make of it. - About steroids?

454
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,040
<12-17,CASTLE>-不是  -是关于那神秘的摩尔达维亚人吗
<12-17,CASTLE>- No. - About our mysterious Moldavian?

455
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,320
<12-18,RYAN>不  也不是
<12-18,RYAN>No, not that either.

456
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,810
<12-18,RYAN>扫黄组和缉毒组均没留意过扎克和东欧男
<12-18,RYAN>Vice and narcotics struck out on Zack and the sketch.

457
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,290
<12-18,RYAN>但是我在悬案资料库里
<12-18,RYAN>But I ran Zack's fingerprints

458
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,270
<12-18,RYAN>比对了扎克的指纹
<12-18,RYAN>through the unsolved latent database.

459
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
<12-18,RYAN>他的指纹跟两周前
<12-18,RYAN>His prints match a set

460
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,820
<12-18,RYAN>在皇后区失窃的一辆车上找到的相匹配
<12-18,RYAN>found on a car stolen in Queens two weeks ago.

461
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,740
<12-19,BECKETT>车是谁的
<12-19,BECKETT>Who's the owner?

462
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,070
<12-20,CASTLE>一位叫派翠西·法莱尔的
<12-20,CASTLE>A Patricia Farrell.

463
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,020
<12-21,BECKETT>没印象
<12-21,BECKETT>Name doesn't ring a bell.

464
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,710
<12-22,CASTLE>我想我知道这是干嘛的了
<12-22,CASTLE>I think I know... what these are about.

465
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,200
<12-23,CASTLE>我看到过一段录像
<12-23,CASTLE>It's, um, a video I saw

466
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,770
<12-23,CASTLE>是前段时间在一个地下网站上看到的
<12-23,CASTLE>on an underground web site a while ago.

467
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,420
<12-24,BECKETT>不奇怪啊
<12-24,BECKETT>Not surprising.

468
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,220
<12-25,CASTLE>就看着吧
<12-25,CASTLE>Just watch.

469
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,820
<12-25,CASTLE>这里
<12-25,CASTLE>Here.

470
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,970
<12-26,BECKETT>扎克不工作也能赚到学费和房租
<12-26,BECKETT>So that's how Zack made tuition and rent

471
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,160
<12-27,CASTLE>-靠的是这个  -扎克可是有工作的
<12-27,CASTLE>- all without a job. - Oh, Zack had a job all right.

472
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,840
<12-27,CASTLE>他是偷车贼
<12-27,CASTLE>He was a car thief.

473
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,060
<13-1,CASTLE>现在我们知道扎克是怎么赚钱的了
<13-1,CASTLE>Now we know how Zack made his money,

474
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,630
<13-1,CASTLE>还有他晚上为什么出去  他是
<13-1,CASTLE>why he was out all night... he was

475
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,180
<13-2,ESPOSITO>-去玩"侠盗猎车手"了  -还是现实版的
<13-2,ESPOSITO>- playing "Grand Theft Auto." - Yeah, the live-action version.

476
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,350
<13-3,BECKETT>或许他是偷了不该偷的车
<13-3,BECKETT>Maybe he boosted the wrong car and got in trouble

477
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,640
<13-3,BECKETT>结果跟他的"同事"起了摩擦
<13-3,BECKETT>with the people he was working with.

478
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,530
<13-4,CASTLE>或许是那位"要命"的立陶宛人
<13-4,CASTLE>Our lethal Lithuanian, perhaps?

479
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,490
<13-5,ESPOSITO>猜错了  老弟
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Guess again, bro.

480
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,830
<13-5,ESPOSITO>我查过扎克那些本森赫斯特的朋友
<13-5,ESPOSITO>I ran the names of Zack's pals from Bensonhurst.

481
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,850
<13-5,ESPOSITO>有一个人有偷车的前科的  叫托马斯·马克恩
<13-5,ESPOSITO>One of them has a prior for auto theft, a Thomas Marcone.

482
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,820
<13-6,BECKETT>汤米·马克恩  布丽吉特说那是
<13-6,BECKETT>Tommy Marcone? Bridget said that

483
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,590
<13-6,BECKETT>扎克高中时最好的朋友
<13-6,BECKETT>that was zack's best friend in high school.

484
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,510
<13-7,ESPOSITO>很多偷车贼都是成双作案的
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Lots of car thieves run in pairs.

485
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,500
<13-8,BECKETT>我们去一趟本森赫斯特吧
<13-8,BECKETT>Let's go to Bensonhurst.

486
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,370
<14-1,BECKETT>就是那里斯卡伦酒吧
<14-1,BECKETT>That's it. Scanlon's bar,

487
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,810
<14-1,BECKETT>汤米·马克恩常在那里闲晃
<14-1,BECKETT>Tommy Marcone's unofficial hangout.

488
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,340
<14-2,CASTLE>看起来这儿的人在为他们的英雄哀悼啊
<14-2,CASTLE>Looks like the neighborhood is mourning their local hero.

489
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,590
<14-3,BECKETT>是啊  不过我现在不确定他还是不是英雄
<14-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, at this point, I'm not sure that's what he was.

490
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,080
<14-4,CASTLE>生于逆境
<14-4,CASTLE>Man born into hardship

491
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,880
<14-4,CASTLE>努力上进
<14-4,CASTLE>struggles to reach for something greater,

492
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,300
<14-4,CASTLE>却躲不过往日的阴影
<14-4,CASTLE>only he can't escape the demons of his past.

493
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,630
<14-4,CASTLE>这是"俄狄浦斯"  是《教父》
<14-4,CASTLE>It's "Oedipus," it's "The Godfather,"

495
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,750
<14-4,CASTLE>《贝弗利山人》
<14-4,CASTLE>"The Beverly Hillbillies".

496
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,640
<14-5,CASTLE>不至于那么好笑吧
<14-5,CASTLE>It wasn't that funny.

497
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,370
<14-6,BECKETT>不是  抱歉  我刚收到一条短信
<14-6,BECKETT>No, I'm sorry. I just got a message.

<14-7,CASTLE>From who? Conrad? It is, isn't it? What did he say?

499
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,270
<14-8,BECKETT>没什么  他就是问问
<14-8,BECKETT>Nothing. He just wants to know what

500
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,670
<14-9,CASTLE>-今晚什么时候见  -这就能把你逗笑
<14-9,CASTLE>- time I can meet up tonight. - And that made you laugh?

501
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,300
<14-10,BECKETT>是啊  他很幽默
<14-10,BECKETT>Yeah. He's funny.

00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,250
<15-1,BECKETT>汤米·马克恩
<15-1,BECKETT>Tommy Marcone.

<15-2,TOMMY MARCONE>You got the wrong guy.

505

<15-3,BECKETT>记得这个吗
<15-3,BECKETT>Remember when?

506
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,660
<15-4,BECKETT>你还在假释期  是吧
<15-4,BECKETT>You're still on probation, aren't you?

507
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,810
<15-4,BECKETT>我有几个关于扎克·林赛谋杀案的问题要问
<15-4,BECKETT>Got a couple of questions about Zack Lindsey's murder.

508
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,990
<15-5,TOMMY MARCONE>你为何要在整个酒吧的人面前审我啊
<15-5,TOMMY MARCONE>Why you gotta sweat me in front of the whole bar?

509
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,550
<15-6,BECKETT>那你想我怎么做  带你回局里吗
<15-6,BECKETT>What do you want me to do, take you downtown?

510
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,860
<15-6,BECKETT>我知道你们两个
<15-6,BECKETT>I know that the two of you

511
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,040
<15-7,TOMMY MARCONE>-曾一起偷车  -你没有证据
<15-7,TOMMY MARCONE>- were stealing cars together. - You can't prove that.

512
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,630
<15-8,BECKETT>我知道你们俩是朋友
<15-8,BECKETT>I know that the two of you were friends,

513
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,820
<15-8,BECKETT>我知道我在一辆被盗的车上查到扎克的指纹
<15-8,BECKETT>I know that I've got Zack's prints on a stolen car,

514
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,690
<15-8,BECKETT>我还知道你有前科
<15-8,BECKETT>and I also know that you have priors.

515
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,460
<15-9,CASTLE>既然你们俩是朋友  我们就想
<15-9,CASTLE>And since you two are friends, we thought

516
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,490
<15-9,CASTLE>或许你不会对扎克的死无动于衷
<15-9,CASTLE>maybe you'd care that Zack's laying on a slab

517
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,860
<15-9,CASTLE>会想要帮帮他
<15-9,CASTLE>and thought you might want to help him.

518
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,510
<15-10,TOMMY MARCONE>他死了  我帮不上什么忙
<15-10,TOMMY MARCONE>He's dead. Ain't nothing I can do now.

519
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,650
<15-11,BECKETT>你干嘛不说说你谋杀当日
<15-11,BECKETT>Why don't you tell me where you were

520
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,830
<15-11,BECKETT>凌晨1点到5点在哪
<15-11,BECKETT>between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m. the night of the murder?

521
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,940
<15-12,TOMMY MARCONE>你在浪费时间
<15-12,TOMMY MARCONE>You're wasting your time.

522
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,930
<15-13,CASTLE>你见过这个男人吗
<15-13,CASTLE>You ever see this man?

523
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,660
<15-14,TOMMY MARCONE>没有  你的手表对一个警察来说太贵了
<15-14,TOMMY MARCONE>No, and your watch is too expensive for a cop's.

524
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,170
<15-14,TOMMY MARCONE>那么探长  这家伙是谁
<15-14,TOMMY MARCONE>So, detective, who's this guy?

525
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,830
<15-15,CASTLE>他是为在座所有人买单的人
<15-15,CASTLE>He's the guy buying a round for the house.

526
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,560
<15-16,BECKETT>汤米  如果你知道什么  你应该告诉我
<15-16,BECKETT>Tommy, if you know something, you should talk.

527
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,180
<15-17,CASTLE>各位  这轮酒我请客
<15-17,CASTLE>Hey, everybody, a round for the house.

528

<15-17,CASTLE>以此纪念扎克·林赛
<15-17,CASTLE>In memory of Zack Lindsey.

529
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,920
<15-18,BARTENDER>扎克是个好孩子
<15-18,BARTENDER>Zack was a great kid.

530
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,960
<15-18,BARTENDER>这里所有人都很喜欢他
<15-18,BARTENDER>Everybody around here loved him,

531
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,940
<15-18,BARTENDER>包括汤米
<15-18,BARTENDER>Tommy included.

532
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,400
<16-1,ESPOSITO>素描上的人
<16-1,ESPOSITO>well, the guy in the sketch

533
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,200
<16-1,ESPOSITO>肯定是吉米·伦农
<16-1,ESPOSITO>is definitely Jimmy Lennon--

534

<16-1,ESPOSITO>assault, assault with a deadly weapon.

537
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,700
<16-1,ESPOSITO>28岁时移民至美国
<16-1,ESPOSITO>He immigrated to the U.S. when he was 28.

538
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,460
<16-1,ESPOSITO>但是他出生于白俄罗斯明斯克的
<16-1,ESPOSITO>But he was born Janusz Lenadovsky

539
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,770
<16-1,ESPOSITO>亚努斯兰纳戴夫斯基
<16-1,ESPOSITO>in Minsk, Belarus.

540
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,280
<16-2,CASTLE>白俄罗斯  我知道  就在立陶宛旁边
<16-2,CASTLE>Belarus. I knew it. That's right next to Lithuania.

541
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,380
<16-3,ESPOSITO>这上面写着他在U大街拥有一家汽车修理店
<16-3,ESPOSITO>It says here that he owns an auto repair shop on Avenue U.

542
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,930
<16-3,ESPOSITO>当心点  这家伙很危险
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Watch your backs on this one. This guy is dangerous.

543
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,440
<17-1,JIMMY LENNON>那里
<17-1,JIMMY LENNON>There.

544
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,850
<17-2,BECKETT>吉米·伦农
<17-2,BECKETT>Jimmy Lennon.

545
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,100
<17-3,ESPOSITO>纽约...站住
<17-3,ESPOSITO>NYP--hey!

<17-4,BECKETT>将其他人抓起来  给汽车盗窃组打电话
<17-4,BECKETT>Round up the others. Call burglary auto.

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,150
<17-5,RYAN>纽约警局
<17-5,RYAN>Hey! Hey! NYPD!

548
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,750
<17-6,JIMMY LENNON>这是合法生意  我是修车的
<17-6,JIMMY LENNON>This is clean business. I fix these cars.

549
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,360
<17-6,JIMMY LENNON>真的吗
<17-6,JIMMY LENNON>Really?

550
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,850
<17-7,BECKETT>我打赌车主听到这话会非常吃惊的
<17-7,BECKETT>I bet the people who own them would be surprised to hear that.

551
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,850
<17-7,BECKETT>现在我想知道有关扎克·林赛的事
<17-7,BECKETT>Now I want to know about Zack Lindsey.

552
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,430
<17-8,JIMMY LENNON>我什么也不知道
<17-8,JIMMY LENNON>I know not.

553
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,930
<17-9,BECKETT>从你嘴里说出的并不是
<17-9,BECKETT>Not the best three words to have

554
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,130
<17-9,BECKETT>我最想听到的话  吉米
<17-9,BECKETT>falling out of your mouth, Jimmy.

555
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,220
<17-10,CASTLE>我本期待他会说麋鹿和松鼠呢
<17-10,CASTLE>I was half expecting "Moose" and "Squirrel".

556
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,720
<17-11,BECKETT>你会进监狱的  待多久就取决于你了
<17-11,BECKETT>You're going to jail. How long depends on you.

557
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,760
<17-12,JIMMY LENNON>你们国家的监狱就像度假村
<17-12,JIMMY LENNON>Jail in your country is vacation.

558
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,280
<17-13,BECKETT>我会让它变成最烂的度假村
<17-13,BECKETT>Then I will make it very difficult.

559
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,430
<17-13,BECKETT>我是这么想的  我认为扎克为你偷车
<17-13,BECKETT>Here's what I think--I think that Zack stole cars for you.

560
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,030
<17-13,BECKETT>但他有更好的打算  他告诉你他不想干了
<17-13,BECKETT>But he had bigger plans, and he told you he wanted out.

561
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,470
<17-13,BECKETT>你担心他会告诉别人
<17-13,BECKETT>You were worried he couldn't keep his mouth shut,

562
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,780
<17-13,BECKETT>所以你就威胁他
<17-13,BECKETT>so you threatened him

563
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,220
<17-13,BECKETT>告诉他不能退出
<17-13,BECKETT>and told him, there's no walking outta this.

564
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,470
<17-13,BECKETT>他还是没改变主意  你就跟踪他
<17-13,BECKETT>And when he didn't change his mind, you followed him

565
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,140
<17-13,BECKETT>来到泳池边  然后杀了他
<17-13,BECKETT>to the pool and you killed him.

566
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,950
<17-13,BECKETT>还有什么需要补充的吗
<17-13,BECKETT>Is there anything you want to add to that?

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,220
<17-13,BECKETT>你要好自为之  吉米  这是你最后的机会
<17-13,BECKETT>You should help yourself, Jimmy. This is your last chance.

568
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,810
<17-14,CASTLE>为金牌而游
<17-14,CASTLE>Swim for gold.

569
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,760
<17-15,BECKETT>什么
<17-15,BECKETT>What?

570
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,670
<17-16,CASTLE>那边有辆车
<17-16,CASTLE>There's a car over there

571
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,040
<17-16,CASTLE>车牌是SWM4GLD
<17-16,CASTLE>with the license plate "SWM4GLD."

572
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,840
<17-18,BECKETT>这辆车注册在康涅狄格州格林威治镇
<17-18,BECKETT>This car is registered to a Brian Morris

573
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,710
<17-18,BECKETT>布莱恩·莫里斯名下
<17-18,BECKETT>Of Greenwich, Connecticut.

574
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,290
<17-19,CASTLE>布莱恩·莫里斯  那是扎克的一名队友
<17-19,CASTLE>Brian Morris. That's one of Zack's teammates.

575
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,760
<17-19,CASTLE>那是他主要的竞争对手
<17-19,CASTLE>That's his main rival.

576
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,530
<17-19,CASTLE>那么要么是布莱恩的引擎需要翻新了
<17-19,CASTLE>So either Brian needed his engine rebuilt or...

577
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,170
<17-20,BECKETT>要么就是这辆车被偷了
<17-20,BECKETT>Or this car is stolen.

578
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,020
<17-20,BECKETT>扎克为什么要偷布莱恩的车呢
<17-20,BECKETT>So why would Zack steal Brian's car?

579
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,550
<17-20,BECKETT>我不知道
<17-20,BECKETT>I don't know.

580
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,330
<17-21,CASTLE>但是我知道布莱恩为什么有谋杀动机了
<17-21,CASTLE>But I know why it gave brian a motive for murder.

581
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,060
<17-21,CASTLE>我们在扎克公寓发现的类固醇
<17-21,CASTLE>Those steroids we found in Zack's apartment...

582
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,630
<17-21,CASTLE>他没服用的那些
<17-21,CASTLE>that he wasn't taking

583
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,690
<17-21,CASTLE>也许是布莱恩的
<17-21,CASTLE>maybe they're Brian's.

584
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,330
<18-1,TOMMY MARCONE>为什么让我来这里  我没做什么坏事
<18-1,TOMMY MARCONE>Why you got me in here? I didn't do nothin' wrong.

585
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,890
<18-2,BECKETT>没做吗  扎克在游泳队的竞争对手
<18-2,BECKETT>No? Zack's rival on the swim team,

586
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,890
<18-2,BECKETT>布莱恩·莫里斯
<18-2,BECKETT>Brian Morris.

587
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,640
<18-2,BECKETT>我们在地下拆车厂发现了他的克尔维特跑车
<18-2,BECKETT>We found his sting Ray at the chop shop--

588
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,770
<18-2,BECKETT>你偷走的那辆
<18-2,BECKETT>the one you stole.

589
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,300
<18-3,TOMMY MARCONE>我都不知道那是什么意思
<18-3,TOMMY MARCONE>I don't even know what that means.

590
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,120
<18-4,BECKETT>车上有扎克的指纹  也有你的
<18-4,BECKETT>Zack's prints were on it, and so were yours.

591
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,520
<18-4,BECKETT>所以别装了
<18-4,BECKETT>So stop playing around.

592
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,780
<18-5,CASTLE>你们为什么偷那辆车
<18-5,CASTLE>Why did you boost the car?

593
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,480
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>因为布莱恩·莫里斯是一个装逼的富二代
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>Because Brian Morris is a silver-spoon-licking punk.

594
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,200
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>他恨扎克  因为扎克比他游得更好
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>He hated Zack for being a better swimmer.

595
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,410
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>两周前  他在扎克赛前餐里
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>Two weeks ago, he spiked Zack's pregame meal

596
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,500
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>偷偷下了药让他生病
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>to make him sick.

597
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,260
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>扎克还是赢了比赛
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>Zack won the meet anyway.

598
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,190
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>没多久他就知道是布莱恩搞的鬼
<18-6,TOMMY MARCONE>Didn't take him long to figure out it was Brian, though.

599
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,080
<18-7,CASTLE>你们偷那辆车是为了报复
<18-7,CASTLE>So you took the car out of revenge?

600
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,910
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>"为金牌而游"  那种虚荣牌照
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>"SWM4GLD" vanity plates--

601
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,850
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>要不要再土鳖一点啊
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>I mean, can you get any more douchey?

602
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,340
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>布莱恩在格林威治有自己的训练泳池
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>Brian's up in Greenwich with his own training pool,

603
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,840
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>私人教练  应有尽有
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>private coaches, whatever he needs.

604
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,580
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>而扎克却被困在这里
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>Meanwhile Zack's stuck here,

605
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,920
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>偷车就是为了混口饭吃
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>boosting cars just so he can eat.

606
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,700
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>因为他不能拿别人的钱
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>'Cause he can't take a nickel of outside money

607
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,560
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>拿了他就完了
<18-8,TOMMY MARCONE>or else he's done.

608
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,160
<18-9,CASTLE>你们是怎么找到类固醇的
<18-9,CASTLE>How did you find the steroids?

609
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,120
<18-10,TOMMY MARCONE>一定要检查车子
<18-10,TOMMY MARCONE>You always search a car.

610
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,050
<18-10,TOMMY MARCONE>永远不要招惹自己招惹不起的
<18-10,TOMMY MARCONE>You never want more than you bargained for.

611
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,970
<18-11,CASTLE>比如后车厢里死掉的黑手党吗
<18-11,CASTLE>Like a dead mobster in the trunk?

612
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,710
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>那种事常有
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>That stuff happens.

613
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,900
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>我们像往常一样检查那辆车
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>We searched the car like always,

614
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,310
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>扎克在车坐垫下面发现了一个包
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>Zack found a bag underneath the seat,

615
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,240
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>他当场就明白了  布莱恩在用药
<18-12,TOMMY MARCONE>and he knew right then and there, Brian was juicing.

616
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,250
<18-13,BECKETT>扎克对这个发现有什么打算吗
<18-13,BECKETT>Did Zack have any plans for this information?

617
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,140
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>他还没想好  这可是件大事
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>He hadn't figured that out yet. Kind of a big deal, you know?

618
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,370
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>我说他应该举报那个作弊的混蛋布莱恩
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>I told him he should turn that cheating bastard Brian in,

619
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,240
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>让他禁赛
<18-14,TOMMY MARCONE>get his ass banned.

620
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,190
<18-15,CASTLE>我猜他没得到机会
<18-15,CASTLE>Guess he never got the chance.

621
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,130
<18-16,TOMMY MARCONE>是啊
<18-16,TOMMY MARCONE>I guess not.

622
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,450
<18-17,BECKETT>扎克是你最好的朋友  汤米
<18-17,BECKETT>Zack was supposed to be your friend, tommy.

623
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,630
<18-17,BECKETT>为什么你一开始不告诉我们这些
<18-17,BECKETT>Why didn't you tell us this from the start?

624
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,200
<18-18,TOMMY MARCONE>我不知道  也许
<18-18,TOMMY MARCONE>I don't know. Maybe...

625
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,580
<18-18,TOMMY MARCONE>我太害怕了
<18-18,TOMMY MARCONE>I was scared.

626
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,580
<18-19,BECKETT>好吧  别出城
<18-19,BECKETT>All right. Stick around.

627
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,030
<18-19,BECKETT>我还会找你
<18-19,BECKETT>I'm not done with you.

628
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,520
<19-1,BECKETT>你认识这个吗  布莱恩
<19-1,BECKETT>You recognize this, Brian?

629
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,980
<19-2,LAWYER>探长  如果一开始就是对抗式审判
<19-2,LAWYER>If it's gonna be adversarial from the outset, detective...

630
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,730
<19-3,BECKETT>用这个作为对抗式审判怎么样  律师
<19-3,BECKETT>How's this for adversarial, counselor?

631
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,170
<19-3,BECKETT>扎克·林赛在发现你委托人车上违法的
<19-3,BECKETT>Zack Lindsey was killed after he found

632
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,260
<19-3,BECKETT>类固醇后就被杀死了
<19-3,BECKETT>a cache of illegal steroids in your client's car.

633
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,980
<19-4,LAWYER>一辆显然是他偷走的车
<19-4,LAWYER>A car he apparently stole.

634
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,030
<19-5,BECKETT>奇怪的是  你儿子从来没有举报过
<19-5,BECKETT>And oddly enough, your son never, ever reported it...

635
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,000
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>她在那就像只老虎
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>She's like a tiger in there.

636
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,580
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>我永远都看不腻她
<19-6,MONTGOMERY>I never get tired of watching her.

637
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,180
<19-8,CASTLE>我也是
<19-8,CASTLE>Me neither.

638
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,790
<19-9,MONTGOMERY>貌似艾利克斯·康拉德也这么想
<19-9,MONTGOMERY>Seems like Alex Conrad feels the same way.

639
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,140
<19-10,BRIAN CONRAD>一辆价值超过七万的古董车不见了
<19-10,BRIAN CONRAD>A classic car worth over 70 grand goes missing,

640
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,610
<19-11,BECKETT>而你却告诉我你不知道它不见了
<19-11,BECKETT>and you're telling me that you had no idea it was gone?

641
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,310
<19-12,BRIAN CONRAD>我怎么会知道  我几乎没开过它
<19-12,BRIAN CONRAD>Why would I? I... I barely even drive it.

642
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,060
<19-13,BECKETT>你知道那车被偷了
<19-13,BECKETT>You knew that car was stolen.

643
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,800
<19-13,BECKETT>你不想要警察找到它
<19-13,BECKETT>You didn't want police to recover it.

644
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
<19-13,BECKETT>以免他们找到更多的这些
<19-13,BECKETT>In case they found more of these.

645
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>你没有证据
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>You have no proof of that.

646
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,850
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>扎克可能是将类固醇栽赃到布莱恩车上
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>Zack could've planted steroids in Brian's car.

647
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,290
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>但是他没有
<19-14,BENJAMIN MORRIS>But he didn't.

648
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,030
<19-15,BECKETT>我认为扎克因为那些类固醇
<19-15,BECKETT>You know, I think that Zack confronted you

649
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,400
<19-15,BECKETT>而去找你当面对质
<19-15,BECKETT>about those steroids.

650
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,140
<19-15,BECKETT>而你知道一旦他举报了你  你就要
<19-15,BECKETT>And you knew if he reported you, you could

651
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,950
<19-15,BECKETT>和你的奥林匹克梦说再见了  于是你杀了他
<19-15,BECKETT>kiss your Olympic dreams good-bye, and so you killed him.

652
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,210
<19-15,BECKETT>布莱恩  你杀了扎克
<19-15,BECKETT>Brian, you killed Zack.

653
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,540
<19-15,BECKETT>然后你就闯入他的公寓
<19-15,BECKETT>And then you broke into his apartment

654
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,150
<19-15,BECKETT>试图销毁你的罪证
<19-15,BECKETT>and tried to cover your tracks.

655
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,930
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>据我回忆
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>To my recollection,

656
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,610
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>扎克·林赛和我绝对没有讨论过
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>at no point did Zack Lindsey and I discuss

657
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,790
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>任何有关兴奋剂的事
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>any performance-enhancing substance.

658
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,320
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>而且我也不知道是谁杀了他
<19-16,BRIAN CONRAD>And I have no idea who killed him.

659
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,720
<19-17,BECKETT>布莱恩  你的表现可配不上金牌
<19-17,BECKETT>Not a gold medal performance, Brian.

660
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,840
<19-17,BECKETT>案发当晚的凌晨1点至5点
<19-17,BECKETT>Where were you between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m.

661
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,740
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>你在哪里
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>the night of the murder?

662
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,930
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>我都说过多少遍了
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>We've been over all this.

663
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,430
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>我在父母家的游泳池练习
<19-18,BENJAMIN MORRIS>I was at the practice pool at my parents' house.

664
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,870
<19-19,LAWYER>这张影碟是安在训练池上方的摄像机拍下的
<19-19,LAWYER>This DVD is from a camera mounted above the training pool.

665
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,510
<19-19,LAWYER>上面有时间和日期
<19-19,LAWYER>It has the date and time running in the corner.

666
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,490
<19-20,BECKETT>太容易伪造了
<19-20,BECKETT>Easily altered.

667
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,670
<19-21,LAWYER>此外  莫里斯家族和其员工都担保
<19-21,LAWYER>Furthermore, the Morris family and staff all swear

668
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,450
<19-21,LAWYER>布莱恩那天在家  我有书面证词
<19-21,LAWYER>Brian was at home, and I have affidavits.

669
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,040
<19-22,BECKETT>你肯定有
<19-22,BECKETT>I'm sure you do.

670
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,940
<19-23,LAWYER>除非你要起诉我的当事人
<19-23,LAWYER>So unless you're charging my client,

671
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,960
<19-23,LAWYER>否则我们告辞了
<19-23,LAWYER>we're done here.

672
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,520
<19-24,BENJAMIN MORRIS>我儿子一定会参加奥运会
<19-24,BENJAMIN MORRIS>My son will go to the Olympics,

673
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,230
<19-24,BENJAMIN MORRIS>谁也别想阻拦  探长
<19-24,BENJAMIN MORRIS>and no one's going to derail that, detective.

674
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,160
<20-1,CASTLE>布莱恩有作案手段  有作案动机
<20-1,CASTLE>Brian had means, he had motive.

675
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,510
<20-1,CASTLE>满足了这两条
<20-1,CASTLE>That's at least two.

676
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,870
<20-1,CASTLE>那他作案的时机呢
<20-1,CASTLE>What about opportunity?

677
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,400
<20-2,MONTGOMERY>很明显  他父亲会不惜一切代价
<20-2,MONTGOMERY>Clearly, his father would do whatever it takes

678
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,060
<20-2,MONTGOMERY>为他掩护  好让他能继续游泳
<20-2,MONTGOMERY>to cover for him so he can keep on swimming.

679
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,980
<20-3,BECKETT>布莱恩有这样的团队支持
<20-3,BECKETT>Well, with the kind of team Brian had, there's no way

680
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,110
<20-3,BECKETT>我们根本找不到证据
<20-3,BECKETT>we'll be able to prove

681
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,000
<20-3,BECKETT>证明他在大学泳池出现过
<20-3,BECKETT>that he was at the U.N.Y. Pool.

682
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,160
<20-4,CASTLE>也许他真的没出现过
<20-4,CASTLE>Maybe because he wasn't.

683
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,770
<20-4,CASTLE>看看布莱恩这类人
<20-4,CASTLE>Look what kind of guy Brian is--pampered,

684
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,010
<20-4,CASTLE>被他父亲娇惯  保护和操控着
<20-4,CASTLE>protected, dominated by his father.

685
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,710
<20-4,CASTLE>他可不是"实干家"
<20-4,CASTLE>This is not a man of action.

686
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,000
<20-5,BECKETT>那你的意思是
<20-5,BECKETT>So what are you suggesting?

687
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,890
<20-6,CASTLE>他不会脏了自己的手
<20-6,CASTLE>That he's not the kind of guy to get his hands dirty.

688
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,240
<20-7,MONTGOMERY>也许有老爸为他善后
<20-7,MONTGOMERY>Maybe daddy cleaned up his mess.

689
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,050
<20-8,CASTLE>或者是买凶杀人
<20-8,CASTLE>Or he hired someone to do it for him.

690
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,330
<20-9,BECKETT>莱恩  你能查到莫里斯家族的财务状况吗
<20-9,BECKETT>Ryan, can you look into the Morris' financials?

691
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,830
<20-9,BECKETT>查查案发前后有没有什么大额付款
<20-9,BECKETT>Look for large payments made around the time of the murder,

692
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,690
<20-9,BECKETT>尤其是现金支取
<20-9,BECKETT>especially cash withdrawals.

693
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,510
<20-10,RYAN>已经查了
<20-10,RYAN>Already on it.

694
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,950
<20-10,RYAN>老爸是一个对冲基金经理
<20-10,RYAN>The dad is a Hedge Fund Manager,

695
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,450
<20-10,RYAN>要查他的财务  得找个工商管理学硕士
<20-10,RYAN>so you practically need an MBA to follow the money.

696
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,270
<20-10,RYAN>但是孩子这有线索
<20-10,RYAN>But there was something about the kid.

697
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,400
<20-10,RYAN>有一笔担保的钱
<20-10,RYAN>There was a bond.

698
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,030
<20-11,CASTLE>是保释金吗
<20-11,CASTLE>As in bail bond?

699
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,920
<20-12,RYAN>是储蓄金
<20-12,RYAN>As in savings bond.

700
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,860
<20-12,RYAN>在布莱恩的车被盗后三天
<20-12,RYAN>Three days after Brian's car was stolen,

701
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,820
<20-12,RYAN>他从储蓄金里提现2万5千元美金
<20-12,RYAN>he cashed in a savings bond in the amount of $25,000.

702
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,280
<20-13,MONTGOMERY>足够雇个职业杀手了
<20-13,MONTGOMERY>That's enough to hire a hit man.

703
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,810
<20-14,CASTLE>尤其在当今这个竞争激烈的求职市场
<20-14,CASTLE>Especially in today's competitive job market.

704
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,070
<20-15,ESPOSITO>布莱恩是从格林威治联邦银行里提现的吗
<20-15,ESPOSITO>Did Brian Morris cash that bond at Greenwich Federal Bank?

705
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,740
<20-16,RYAN>是啊  你发现了什么
<20-16,RYAN>Matter of fact, he did. What do you got?

706
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,840
<20-17,ESPOSITO>我们刚刚搜了托马斯·马克恩的住所
<20-17,ESPOSITO>We just searched Thomas Marcone's place.

707
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,470
<20-17,ESPOSITO>发现了一些偷车工具
<20-17,ESPOSITO>Found tools of the auto theft trade.

708
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,700
<20-17,ESPOSITO>还有这个
<20-17,ESPOSITO>But we also found this.

709
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,180
<20-18,BECKETT>看起来差不多有2万5美元
<20-18,BECKETT>That looks like 25 grand.

710
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,510
<20-19,ESPOSITO>猜猜是哪来的
<20-19,ESPOSITO>And guess where it's from.

711
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,340
<20-20,CASTLE>格林威治联邦银行
<20-20,CASTLE>Greenwich Federal Bank.

712
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,440
<21-1,TOMMY MARCONE>扎克不是我杀的
<21-1,TOMMY MARCONE>I didn't kill Zack.

713
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,310
<21-2,BECKETT>汤米  似乎你每开一次口
<21-2,BECKETT>Tommy, it seems like every time

714
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,100
<21-2,BECKETT>就有一个新的谎言跑出来
<21-2,BECKETT>you open your mouth, another lie falls out.

715
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,240
<21-3,TOMMY MARCONE>我没说谎
<21-3,TOMMY MARCONE>But I'm not lying.

716
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,440
<21-4,BECKETT>那你为什么收了布莱恩·莫里斯的2万5千块
<21-4,BECKETT>Then why did you take 25 grand from Brian Morris?

717
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,200
<21-5,CASTLE>据我回忆  你管这个人叫
<21-5,CASTLE>A man you characterized as a "cheating bastard,"

718
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,380
<21-5,CASTLE>"作弊的混蛋"
<21-5,CASTLE>as I recall.

719
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,210
<21-6,TOMMY MARCONE>好吧  也许扎克的死是因为我
<21-6,TOMMY MARCONE>Okay, I may have gotten Zack killed,

720
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,670
<21-6,TOMMY MARCONE>但不是你们想的那样
<21-6,TOMMY MARCONE>but not the way you think.

721
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,550
<21-7,CASTLE>是勒索
<21-7,CASTLE>It was blackmail.

722
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,100
<21-7,CASTLE>你勒索了布莱恩·莫里斯
<21-7,CASTLE>You blackmailed Brian Morris.

723
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,470
<21-8,TOMMY MARCONE>他一直在用类固醇
<21-8,TOMMY MARCONE>Him being on steroids--

724
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,590
<21-8,TOMMY MARCONE>我觉得这个信息很有价值
<21-8,TOMMY MARCONE>Yeah, I figured that knowledge was worth something.

725
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,860
<21-9,BECKETT>扎克参与了吗
<21-9,BECKETT>Was Zack in on this?

726
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,000
<21-10,TOMMY MARCONE>他要是知道了会把我
<21-10,TOMMY MARCONE>He woulda kicked my ass

727
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,290
<21-10,TOMMY MARCONE>一直踢到第18大街的
<21-10,TOMMY MARCONE>up and down 18th Avenue if he found out.

728
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,250
<21-11,BECKETT>踢你也是你活该
<21-11,BECKETT>And been justified.

729
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,480
<21-12,TOMMY MARCONE>布莱恩不认识我  我认为
<21-12,TOMMY MARCONE>Look, Brian didn't know me, and I figured, he wouldn't pay

730
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,720
<21-12,TOMMY MARCONE>他不会把钱给一个匿名勒索的家伙
<21-12,TOMMY MARCONE>if he got blackmailed by some anonymous mook.

731
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,110
<21-13,BECKETT>所以你就假扮成扎克
<21-13,BECKETT>So you pretended to be Zack.

732
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,690
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>我用图书馆的电脑登陆了扎克的邮箱
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>I used the library computer and Zack's e-mail account.

733
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,890
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>给布莱恩发了封电邮
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>I emailed Brian

734
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,490
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>说我拿到了他的类固醇
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>saying I had his 'roids

735
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,100
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>说我要举报他
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>and I was gonna rat him out

736
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,810
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>除非他用纸袋装2万5千块
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>unless he put 25 grand into a paper bag

737
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,850
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>放在方院的长椅下面
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>and left it underneath a bench at the quad.

738
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,700
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>等周围没人的时候  我把钱拿走
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>When the coast was clear, I picked it up.

739
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,330
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>我无意伤害任何人
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

740
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,760
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>我想打个电话
<21-14,TOMMY MARCONE>I'd like that phone call now.

741
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,650
<22-1,BECKETT>扎克偷了布莱恩的车
<22-1,BECKETT>Okay, so Zack stole Brian's stash

742
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,460
<22-1,BECKETT>但由于汤米
<22-1,BECKETT>and because of Tommy,

743
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,150
<22-1,BECKETT>布莱恩以为是扎克在勒索他
<22-1,BECKETT>Brian thought that Zack... was blackmailing him.

744
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,250
<22-1,BECKETT>布莱恩的杀人动机真是越来越强烈了
<22-1,BECKETT>Brian's motive just keeps getting stronger and stronger.

745
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,080
<22-2,CASTLE>就像打了类固醇一样
<22-2,CASTLE>Almost like it's on steroids.

746
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,150
<22-2,CASTLE>-蒂诺威女士  -汤米·马克恩打电话
<22-2,CASTLE>- Ms. Dinovi. - Tommy Marcone called,

747
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,550
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>说你们把他抓这来了
<23-1,MONTGOMERY>said you have him in here.

748
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,350
<23-2,LORRAINE DINOVI>他还说是布莱恩·莫里斯杀了我儿子
<23-2,LORRAINE DINOVI>He said Brian Morris killed my son.

749
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,200
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>还不确定
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>We don't know all that.

750
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,630
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>他只是有嫌疑而已
<23-3,MONTGOMERY>We just know he's a person of interest.

751
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,810
<23-4,LORRAINE DINOVI>那你们为什么不拘捕他
<23-4,LORRAINE DINOVI>So why didn't you arrest him?

752
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,150
<23-5,MONTGOMERY>我们没有足够的证据扣留他
<23-5,MONTGOMERY>We don't have enough to hold him.

753
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,760
<23-6,LORRAINE DINOVI>还因为他是富翁的儿子
<23-6,LORRAINE DINOVI>And he's the son of a millionaire.

754
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,050
<23-6,LORRAINE DINOVI>肯定跟这个脱不了关系
<23-6,LORRAINE DINOVI>I bet that doesn't hurt either.

755
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,210
<23-7,MONTGOMERY>在这里  讲求的是证据
<23-7,MONTGOMERY>Around here, it's about the evidence,

756
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,850
<23-7,MONTGOMERY>而不是谁的钱包有多厚
<23-7,MONTGOMERY>not how fat someone's wallet is.

757
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,520
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>我活在现实世界里
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>Yeah, well, I live in the real world,

758
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,440
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>我知道那男孩的家庭背景
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>and I know that boy's family,

759
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,180
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>他们定会不惜一切代价去保护他
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>and they're gonna do whatever it takes to protect him

760
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,760
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>因为他们有这个能力
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>because they can.

761
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,620
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>队长  扎克是我的全部
<23-8,LORRAINE DINOVI>Captain... Zack's all I had.

762
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:12,750
<24-1,BECKETT>除非我们找到真凶  否则无法确定
<24-1,BECKETT>We can't figure out if Brian is connected to the murder

763
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,300
<24-1,BECKETT>布莱恩是否跟本案有直接联系
<24-1,BECKETT>until we find the real killer.

764
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,830
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>那你们就加把劲
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>Then you're gonna have to dig deeper.

765
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,930
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>如果布莱恩和他的家人参与了本案
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>If Brian and his family are involved, then there's

766
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,160
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>那其中必然有某种联系
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>gotta be a connection,

767
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,190
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>给我找出来
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>and I want it found.

768
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,940
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>好  谢谢
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>All right, great. Thank you.

769
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,520
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>这个线索也断了
<24-2,MONTGOMERY>We struck out again.

770
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,320
<25-1,BECKETT>莫里斯家在康州的房子
<25-1,BECKETT>The Morris' house in Connecticut

771
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,130
<25-1,BECKETT>大门有警卫  保安公司说
<25-1,BECKETT>is gated, and the security company says

772
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,750
<25-1,BECKETT>案发当晚没有任何人外出
<25-1,BECKETT>that nobody left the night of the murder.

773
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,370
<25-1,BECKETT>他们的证供滴水不漏
<25-1,BECKETT>These guys have everything covered.

774
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,970
<25-3,BECKETT>什么
<25-3,BECKETT>What?

775
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,350
<25-4,CASTLE>扎克的邮箱账号
<25-4,CASTLE>Zack's e-mail account,

776
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,810
<25-4,CASTLE>就是汤米用来勒索布莱恩的那个
<25-4,CASTLE>the one Tommy used to ask Brian for a donation?

777
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,840
<25-4,CASTLE>勒索信是下午3点零2分发出去的
<25-4,CASTLE>The blackmail message was sent at 3:02 p.m.

778
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,750
<25-4,CASTLE>你会以为那会引发布莱恩打很多电话吧
<25-4,CASTLE>You'd think that would've caused a flurry of telephone calls.

779
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,420
<25-4,CASTLE>但他只在3点19分后打了一通电话
<25-4,CASTLE>But he only made one call right after--3:19.

780
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,640
<25-5,BECKETT>是他父亲纽约的办公室电话
<25-5,BECKETT>That's the father's office in New York.

781
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,550
<25-5,BECKETT>有老爸的通话记录吗
<25-5,BECKETT>Do we have the dad's records?

782
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,940
<25-6,RYAN>我这有  从下午3点21分开始
<25-6,RYAN>Yeah, I got it right here. Starting at 3:21 p.m.,

783
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,850
<25-6,RYAN>本杰明·莫里斯打了数十通电话
<25-6,RYAN>Benjamin Morris made about a dozen phone calls,

784
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,730
<25-6,RYAN>全都拨的是2-1-2这个号码
<25-6,RYAN>all to the same 2-1-2 number.

785
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,190
<25-7,BECKETT>查查
<25-7,BECKETT>Run it.

786
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,640
<25-8,ESPOSITO>是雷克斯·克拉伯医生的电话
<25-8,ESPOSITO>It's a Dr. Rex Colabro.

787
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,560
<25-8,ESPOSITO>他是从事运动医学行业的
<25-8,ESPOSITO>He's got a sports medicine practice.

788
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,040
<25-8,ESPOSITO>有好多一流运动员都是他的客户
<25-8,ESPOSITO>He's got a lot of big-time athletes as clients.

789
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,420
<25-9,BECKETT>那么本杰明·莫里斯发现
<25-9,BECKETT>So Benjamin Morris finds out

790
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,130
<25-9,BECKETT>他的儿子被人勒索了
<25-9,BECKETT>that his son is being blackmailed,

791
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,900
<25-9,BECKETT>却打电话给了克拉伯医生
<25-9,BECKETT>and the one phone call he makes is to Dr. Colabro?

792
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,670
<25-9,BECKETT>只有一个理由说得通
<25-9,BECKETT>The only reason that that would make sense is if...

793
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,380
<25-10,CASTLE>克拉伯医生知道类固醇的事
<25-10,CASTLE>Dr. Colabro knew about the steroids,

794
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,930
<25-10,CASTLE>说不定还是他提供的
<25-10,CASTLE>maybe even supplied them.

795
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,020
<25-10,CASTLE>我没向任何人提供过类固醇
<25-10,CASTLE>I don't supply steroids to anyone.

796
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,840
<25-10,CASTLE>从没有  也绝不会
<25-10,CASTLE>Never have. Never will.

797
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,130
<25-10,CASTLE>我见过类固醇所造成的长期伤害
<25-10,CASTLE>I've seen the long-term damage they cause.

798
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,290
<25-10,CASTLE>在我看来  这玩意是毒药
<25-10,CASTLE>As far as I'm concerned, the stuff's poison.

799
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,080
<26-1,BECKETT>那布莱恩·莫里斯呢
<26-1,BECKETT>And what about Brian Morris?

800
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,790
<26-1,BECKETT>他是你的病人吗
<26-1,BECKETT>Is he a patient of yours?

801
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,740
<26-1,BECKETT>这是保密资料
<26-1,BECKETT>That's confidential information.

802
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,710
<26-2,BECKETT>他父亲星期二在两小时内给你打了七通电话
<26-2,BECKETT>His father called you seven times in a 2-hour period on Tuesday.

803
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,990
<26-2,BECKETT>你们聊了什么
<26-2,BECKETT>What did the two of you talk about?

804
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,480
<26-2,BECKETT>这也是保密资料
<26-2,BECKETT>That's confidential as well.

805
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,850
<26-3,BECKETT>克拉伯医生  你的客户
<26-3,BECKETT>Dr. Colabro, your clientele

806
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,960
<26-3,BECKETT>主要是知名运动员
<26-3,BECKETT>is mostly high-profile athletes.

807
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,470
<26-3,BECKETT>你觉得一旦他们发现你跟我们谈过
<26-3,BECKETT>How fast do you think they'll abandon ship

808
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,410
<26-3,BECKETT>类固醇的事  会多快对你弃之不用呢
<26-3,BECKETT>once they find out you're talking with us about steroids?

809
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,460
<26-4,CASTLE>我猜会很快
<26-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing fast.

810
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,380
<26-4,CASTLE>而当他们发现谈的是类固醇和谋杀
<26-4,CASTLE>And when they find out it's steroids and murder,

811
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,870
<26-4,CASTLE>会以光速飞奔
<26-4,CASTLE>it'll jump to lightspeed.

812
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,440
<26-4,CASTLE>谋杀  你觉得我卷入了谋杀吗
<26-4,CASTLE>Murder? You think I'm mixed up in a murder?

813
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,410
<26-5,BECKETT>我觉得为了你自己考虑  最好帮助我们
<26-5,BECKETT>I think that it would be in your best interest to help us.

814
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,480
<26-5,BECKETT>告诉我们本杰明·莫里斯
<26-5,BECKETT>Tell us what you and

815
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,580
<26-5,BECKETT>-和你聊了什么  -而事实上
<26-5,BECKETT>- Benjamin Morris talked about. - And point of fact...

816
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
<26-6,CASTLE>布莱恩是你的病人
<26-6,CASTLE>Brian was your patient,

817
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,650
<26-6,CASTLE>但我想他父亲不是
<26-6,CASTLE>but I'm guessing his father was not.

818
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,410
<26-6,CASTLE>因此不适用于保密条例
<26-6,CASTLE>So confidentiality really doesn't apply.

819
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,010
<26-6,CASTLE>这样如何
<26-6,CASTLE>How's this?

820
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,950
<26-6,CASTLE>假设来说
<26-6,CASTLE>Hypothetically...

821
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,270
<26-6,CASTLE>一个类固醇使用者的专横父亲
<26-6,CASTLE>Why would an overbearing father of

822
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,140
<26-6,CASTLE>为什么会给你打电话
<26-6,CASTLE>a steroid-using swimmer call you?

823
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,670
<26-6,CASTLE>假设来说
<26-6,CASTLE>"Hypothetically"...

824
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,060
<26-6,CASTLE>他可能是问某种违禁药
<26-6,CASTLE>He might have asked how long a certain banned drug

825
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,650
<26-7,CASTLE>在某人的身体里会残留多久
<26-7,CASTLE>would remain detectable in someone's system.

<26-7,CASTLE>担心他儿子的药检呈阳性
<26-7,CASTLE>Worried his son would test positive.

827
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,790
<26-8,BECKETT>还可能聊了什么呢
<26-8,BECKETT>And what else might have come up?

828
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,910
<26-8,BECKETT>运动员避免药检的方法
<26-8,BECKETT>That the way an athlete can avoid testing

829
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,530
<26-9,CASTLE>是他因受伤而临时退出该项运动
<26-9,CASTLE>is if he's injured and temporarily withdraws from the sport.

830
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,520
<26-9,CASTLE>假设而已
<26-9,CASTLE>Hypothetically.

831
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,680
<26-9,CASTLE>假设而已
<26-9,CASTLE>Hypothetically.

832
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,560
<27-1,ESPOSITO>我去申请搜查证
<27-1,ESPOSITO>I'll get a warrant,

833
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,250
<27-1,ESPOSITO>看看克拉伯的办公室里有没有类固醇
<27-1,ESPOSITO>check Colabro's office for steroids.

834
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,550
<27-2,BECKETT>不可能有
<27-2,BECKETT>You won't find any.

835
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,530
<27-2,BECKETT>本杰明打电话来合谋对策
<27-2,BECKETT>Benjamin called in to concoct a strategy

836
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,480
<27-2,BECKETT>以保住布莱恩的参赛资格
<27-2,BECKETT>to protect Brian's eligibility.

837
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,760
<27-2,BECKETT>这是损害控制  不是谋杀
<27-2,BECKETT>This is damage control not murder.

838
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,120
<27-3,ESPOSITO>看来这对策已付诸实施了
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Well, it looks like the strategy has been put into effect.

839
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,780
<27-3,ESPOSITO>布莱恩以肩膀受伤为由退出游泳队
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Brian quit the swim team, said he injured his shoulder.

840
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,220
<27-4,CASTLE>不在游泳队  就不用药检
<27-4,CASTLE>No swim team, no drug testing.

841
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,650
<27-5,BECKETT>我把蕾妮关于类固醇的报告
<27-5,BECKETT>So I checked Lanie's report on the steroids

842
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,520
<27-6,RYAN>与从缉毒组拿到的资料做了对比
<27-6,RYAN>against the file I got from vice.

843
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,020
<27-6,RYAN>发现缉毒组拦截过一批相似的类固醇
<27-6,RYAN>They intercepted a shipment of similar steroids

844
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,020
<27-6,RYAN>是从罗马尼亚的一个实验室运往纽约的
<27-6,RYAN>that came to New York from a lab in Romania.

845
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,410
<27-7,BECKETT>查下布莱恩的生活圈子
<27-7,BECKETT>So let's look into Brian's life,

846
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:26,620
<27-7,BECKETT>看看是否与罗马尼亚有任何联系
<27-7,BECKETT>see if there's any connection to Romania.

847
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,270
<27-7,BECKETT>如果能找到点联系  也许就能
<27-7,BECKETT>If we can find a connect, then hopefully

848
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,360
<27-7,BECKETT>找到杀死扎克的凶手
<27-7,BECKETT>we'll be able to find Zack's killer.

849
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,940

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,260
<29-1,COACH ROME>真是荒唐
<29-1,COACH ROME>This is ridiculous.

912
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,800
<29-1,COACH ROME>那天晚上我在教练宿舍里
<29-1,COACH ROME>I was in my apartment in faculty housing that night.

913
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,990

00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,170
<29-3,COACH ROME>那为什么还要我到这儿来
<29-3,COACH ROME>Okay. So then why am I here?

916
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,560
<29-4,BECKETT>你知道这是什么吗  教练
<29-4,BECKETT>Do you know what this is, coach?

<29-5,COACH ROME>但我队里没有任何人用这玩意
<29-5,COACH ROME>But nobody on my team takes that stuff.

919
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,430
<29-7,COACH ROME>-布莱恩·莫里斯用了 -不可能
<29-7,COACH ROME>- Brian Morris does. - That's not true.

920
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,560
<29-8,BECKETT>显然他是自己使用了类固醇
<29-8,BECKETT>Apparently, this is his steroid of choice.

921
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,370
<29-8,BECKETT>这是从罗马尼亚来的  我知道

924
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,180
<29-10,BECKETT>所以你是在告诉我这只是个巧合吗
<29-10,BECKETT>So you're trying to tell me, it's just a coincidence?

925
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,720
<29-11,COACH ROME>是的
<29-11,COACH ROME>Yeah.

926
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,650
<29-12,BECKETT>就是说如果我搜查你的公寓和办公室
<29-12,BECKETT>So if I search your apartment and your office,

927
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,760
<29-12,BECKETT>我根本就找不到这种药瓶
<29-12,BECKETT>you're telling me that I wouldn't find any of these vials?

928
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,920
<29-13,COACH ROME>你根本不明白
<29-13,COACH ROME>You don't understand.

929
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,660
<29-13,COACH ROME>布莱恩·莫里斯生来就是胜利者
<29-13,COACH ROME>Brian Morris was a lock to win it all.

930
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,410
<29-13,COACH ROME>他身体条件出众  天资过人  资金雄厚
<29-13,COACH ROME>He had the body, he had the talent, the money

931
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,370
<29-13,COACH ROME>这些足以成就他
<29-13,COACH ROME>to make himself the best.

932
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,440
<29-13,COACH ROME>他也是我来纽约大学执教的原因
<29-13,COACH ROME>He's the reason I came to coach at U.N.Y.,

933
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,490
<29-13,COACH ROME>但是去年  布莱恩状态下滑
<29-13,COACH ROME>But last year, Brian peaked,

934
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,060
<29-13,COACH ROME>开始在比赛的最后时刻掉链子
<29-13,COACH ROME>started fading at the ends of races,

935
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,300
<29-13,COACH ROME>然后不知道怎么的
<29-13,COACH ROME>and from outta nowhere,

936
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,090
<29-13,COACH ROME>扎克就成了最好的
<29-13,COACH ROME>zack became the guy to beat.

937
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,380
<29-14,CASTLE>于是你就决定帮布莱恩一把
<29-14,CASTLE>So you decided to give Brian an extra boost

938
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,690
<29-14,CASTLE>让他追上扎克
<29-14,CASTLE>so he could catch up with Zack.

939
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,150
<29-15,COACH ROME>布莱恩的父亲来找我
<29-15,COACH ROME>Brian's father came to me.

940
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,900
<29-15,COACH ROME>他问我还有什么办法
<29-15,COACH ROME>He asked if there was anything more I could do,

941
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,690
<29-15,COACH ROME>他说如果我给出肯定的答复
<29-15,COACH ROME>he said he'd donate millions to the program

942
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,310
<29-15,COACH ROME>就给项目捐款几百万
<29-15,COACH ROME>if that answer was yes.

943
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,330
<29-16,CASTLE>是啊  但是这不光跟钱有关
<29-16,CASTLE>Yeah, but it wasn't just about the money, was it?

944
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,670
<29-16,CASTLE>每个教练都知道
<29-16,CASTLE>Every coach knows,

945
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,620
<29-16,CASTLE>他必须搭上一个明星才能出头
<29-16,CASTLE>he has to hitch his wagon to a star.

946
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,190
<29-16,CASTLE>事实上  你跟一个特别的人就这么干过
<29-16,CASTLE>In fact, you'd done it before, with somebody very special.

947
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,100
<29-17,BECKETT>在来纽约大学之前  你曾经在维明顿任教
<29-17,BECKETT>Before going to U.N.Y., you were coaching in Wilmington.

948
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,150
<29-18,COACH ROME>对  那又如何
<29-18,COACH ROME>That's right. So?

949
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,660
<29-19,CASTLE>你有没有用同样方法帮了某位队员
<29-19,CASTLE>You ever give that same boost to your swimmers there?

950
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,430
<29-19,CASTLE>他们应该会留着那些样本吧
<29-19,CASTLE>They keep those old samples, don't they?

951
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,940
<29-19,CASTLE>非常感谢你的访问
<29-19,CASTLE>Oh, thank you so much for the interview.

952
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,180
<29-19,CASTLE>贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生
<29-19,CASTLE>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

953
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,050
<29-19,CASTLE>调查怎么样了  有新线索吗
<29-19,CASTLE>How goes the investigation? Any new leads?

954
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,920
<30-1,BECKETT>事实上  我们找到了突破口
<30-1,BECKETT>Actually, we think we caught a break.

955
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,140
<30-2,BECKETT>-那真是太好了  -嗯
<30-2,BECKETT>- Well, that's great. - Mm-hmm.

956
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,810
<30-3,CASTLE>是的  对其他人挺好  对你就不太妙了
<30-3,CASTLE>Yes, it is. Well, for everyone except you.

957
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,780
<30-3,CASTLE>我...我不...
<30-3,CASTLE>I... I don't--

958
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,650
<30-4,CASTLE>省省吧  罗博
<30-4,CASTLE>Drop the act, Rob.

959
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,700
<30-4,CASTLE>我们知道你是怎么变成火箭的
<30-4,CASTLE>We know how you got to be the Rocket.

960
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,660
<30-4,CASTLE>罗姆教练告诉了我们
<30-4,CASTLE>Coach Rome told us about

961
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,900
<30-4,CASTLE>早在维明顿他是怎么给你加油的
<30-4,CASTLE>how he gave you rocket fuel back in Wilmington

962
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,740
<30-4,CASTLE>直到助你参加了奥运会都没有停手
<30-4,CASTLE>and didn't stop until you went all the way.

963
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,390
<30-4,CASTLE>你到底在说什么鬼话
<30-4,CASTLE>What the hell are you talking about?

964
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,210
<30-5,BECKETT>我从不作弊  有检测结果为证
<30-5,BECKETT>I have never juiced. I have the test results to prove it.

965
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,070
<30-5,BECKETT>是的  但是他们检测的东西不对
<30-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but they weren't testing for the right thing.

966
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,630
<30-5,BECKETT>我们检查了你最近一次
<30-5,BECKETT>We checked your blood samples

967
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,870
<30-5,BECKETT>摘金比赛的血液样本
<30-5,BECKETT>from the last gold medal race you won

968
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,350
<30-5,BECKETT>与扎克在布莱恩车里发现的
<30-5,BECKETT>against the designer steroids

969
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,720
<30-5,BECKETT>特制类固醇做了对比
<30-5,BECKETT>that Zack found in Brian's car.

970
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,900
<30-5,BECKETT>药检呈阳性
<30-5,BECKETT>It came back positive.

971
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,780
<30-5,BECKETT>那一定是搞错了
<30-5,BECKETT>There was a mistake.

972
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,690
<30-6,BECKETT>凭借药检结果  我们拿到了搜查令
<30-6,BECKETT>And then off of that, we got a warrant

973
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,470
<30-6,BECKETT>对你酒店的房间进行了搜查  我们发现了
<30-6,BECKETT>to search your hotel room, where we found

974
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,270
<30-6,BECKETT>一件衬衣上带有氯  纯氯
<30-6,BECKETT>a shirt with chlorine on it--pure chlorine--

975
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,090
<30-6,BECKETT>杀死扎克的那种氯
<30-6,BECKETT>the kind that killed zack.

976
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,220
<30-6,BECKETT>现在我们正在等待DNA检测结果
<30-6,BECKETT>We're waiting for D.N.A. test results right now.

977
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,210
<30-6,BECKETT>不对  我一整晚都在酒吧待着
<30-6,BECKETT>No, I was at Buddha Bar the whole night.

978
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,440
<30-7,BECKETT>那里人满为患  你可以轻而易举
<30-7,BECKETT>And it was packed there. You could've easily slipped out

979
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,650
<30-7,BECKETT>不引起任何注意的溜出去再赶回来
<30-7,BECKETT>and come back without anyone noticing.

980
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,240
<30-7,BECKETT>荒唐透顶
<30-7,BECKETT>This is ridiculous.

981
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,470
<30-8,CASTLE>我为什么要杀扎克
<30-8,CASTLE>Why would I kill Zack?

982
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,700
<30-8,CASTLE>因为当扎克在布莱恩车中发现了类固醇
<30-8,CASTLE>Because when Zack found steroids in Brian's car,

983
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,680
<30-8,CASTLE>他不知如何是好
<30-8,CASTLE>He was conflicted about what to do.

984
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,330
<30-8,CASTLE>所以他向一个
<30-8,CASTLE>So he sought counsel

985
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,110
<30-8,CASTLE>他确信可以相信的人寻求建议
<30-8,CASTLE>from the one guy he knew he could trust--

986
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,100
<30-8,CASTLE>这个人是个"美国队长"  战功赫赫
<30-8,CASTLE>Captain America, chest full of medals,

987
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,910
<30-8,CASTLE>全民偶像
<30-8,CASTLE>guy on the cereal box.

988
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,250
<30-8,CASTLE>只是你意识到
<30-8,CASTLE>Only you realized,

989
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,200
<30-8,CASTLE>罗姆教练给你和布莱恩使用了
<30-8,CASTLE>Coach Rome had given Brian the same steroids

990
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,230
<30-8,CASTLE>同样的类固醇
<30-8,CASTLE>he had given to you.

991
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,020
<30-9,BECKETT>你也知道如果扎克说出去
<30-9,BECKETT>And you knew that if Zack talked,

992
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:05,970
<30-9,BECKETT>你的事也就曝光了
<30-9,BECKETT>you would be found out.

993
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,760
<30-10,CASTLE>他们会把你的名字从记录册上除去
<30-10,CASTLE>They'd erase your name from the record books.

994
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,360
<30-10,CASTLE>还会收回你所有的奖牌
<30-10,CASTLE>They'd take away all your medals.

995
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,910
<30-10,CASTLE>你将一无所有
<30-10,CASTLE>You would lose everything.

996
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,860
<30-10,CASTLE>而你绝不会让这些事情发生
<30-10,CASTLE>And there was no way you were gonna let that happen.

997
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,970
<30-11,BECKETT>转过去
<30-11,BECKETT>Turn around.

998
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,020
<30-11,BECKETT>好好看看吧  罗博
<30-11,BECKETT>Take a long look, Rob.

999
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,360
<30-11,BECKETT>你要去的那个地方
<30-11,BECKETT>Where you're going...

1000
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,550
<30-11,BECKETT>我觉得那里可不会有泳池  走吧
<30-11,BECKETT>I don't think they have pools. Let's go.

1001
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,700
<31-1,CASTLE>你说这真是讽刺啊
<31-1,CASTLE>You know, it is ironic--

1002
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,220
<31-1,CASTLE>扎克觉得他可以信赖的人  他的导师
<31-1,CASTLE>the one man zack thought he could trust--his mentor--

1003
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,480
<31-1,CASTLE>竟然成了杀他的凶手
<31-1,CASTLE>turned out to be his killer.

1004
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,830
<31-2,BECKETT>是啊  说起导师  我听说你们
<31-2,BECKETT>Yeah, speaking of mentor, I heard that you guys

1005
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,780
<31-2,BECKETT>昨天晚上对康拉德很是严厉啊
<31-2,BECKETT>were pretty hard on Conrad last night.

1006
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,090
<31-3,CASTLE>对他严厉
<31-3,CASTLE>Hard on him?

1007
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,380
<31-3,CASTLE>才不是  只是有爱的调教他一下
<31-3,CASTLE>No, no, it was just a little friendly hazing.

1008
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,660
<31-4,BECKETT>听他的描述更像是
<31-4,BECKETT>To hear him describe it, it sounds like

1009
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,480
<31-4,BECKETT>某人要教训他一下
<31-4,BECKETT>someone was trying to teach him a lesson.

1010
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,680
<31-5,CASTLE>什么  我为什么要那么做
<31-5,CASTLE>What? Why would I want to do that?

1011
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,190
<31-6,BECKETT>因为你不想让他和我在一起
<31-6,BECKETT>Because you didn't want him to spend time with me.

1012
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,850
<31-7,CASTLE>-这完全是...  -真的
<31-7,CASTLE>- That is completely-- - True?

1013
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,640
<31-8,BECKETT>对  好吧
<31-8,BECKETT>Yes. Fine.

1014
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,430
<31-9,CASTLE>是真的  我嫉妒了
<31-9,CASTLE>It's true. I'm jealous.

1015
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,400
<31-9,CASTLE>好吧  我承认了
<31-9,CASTLE>There. I said it.

1016
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:00,930
<31-9,CASTLE>我...
<31-9,CASTLE>I...

1017
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,200
<31-9,CASTLE>我只想让你专属我一个人
<31-9,CASTLE>I want you all to myself,

1018
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,340
<31-9,CASTLE>而让你和另外一个作家在一起
<31-9,CASTLE>and to have you spending time with another writer,

1019
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,380
<31-9,CASTLE>让我很郁闷
<31-9,CASTLE>that upsets me.

1020
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,610
<31-9,CASTLE>如果这样显得我小气  那就小气好了
<31-9,CASTLE>If that makes me petty, so be it.

1021
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,960
<31-9,CASTLE>我就是小气
<31-9,CASTLE>Guilty as charged.

1022
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,500
<31-10,BECKETT>其实  我还觉得挺可爱的
<31-10,BECKETT>Actually, I kinda think it's sweet.

1023
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,710
<31-11,CASTLE>真的
<31-11,CASTLE>You do?

1024
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,660
<31-11,CASTLE>真的
<31-11,CASTLE>I do.

1025
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,710
<31-12,BECKETT>所以你完全不用再担心
<31-12,BECKETT>And that's why you don't have to worry

1026
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,490
<31-12,BECKETT>我跟康拉德在一起了
<31-12,BECKETT>about me hanging around with Conrad anymore.

1027
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,980
<31-12,BECKETT>从现在起  我只专属于一个作家
<31-12,BECKETT>From now on, I am a one-writer girl.

1028
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,810
<31-13,CASTLE>我确实有点过意不去
