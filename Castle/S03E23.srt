<15-20,ESPOSITO>Okay, cue the chandelier.

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,530
<15-20,ESPOSITO>伊利诺伊州  那离曼哈顿十万八千里啊
<15-20,ESPOSITO>Illinois? That's like 500 miles from Manhattan.

3
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,200
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>不  我知道西北大学比斯坦福大学近一点
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>No, I know Northwestern is closer than Stanford.

4
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,060
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>我的意思是
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>I'm just saying,

5
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,140
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>-那不是你想去的地方  -阿丽克西斯
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>- that's not where you want to go. - Alexis?

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,530
<2-3,ALEXIS>等等  阿什  我爸在跟我说话  干啥
<2-3,ALEXIS>Hold on, Ash. My dad's talking to me. What?

7

<2-4,CASTLE>-今天没课吗  -有
<2-4,CASTLE>- Don't you have school? - Yes.

8
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,790
<2-5,ALEXIS>听我说  阿什  我了解你
<2-5,ALEXIS>Look, Ash, I know you,

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,240
<2-5,ALEXIS>我觉得你该离家独立了
<2-5,ALEXIS>and I think you need to get away from home.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,030
<2-6,CASTLE>-我是说  我们都该离家独立了  -说啥呢
<2-6,CASTLE>- I mean, we all need to get away from home. - Hey.

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,350
<2-7,ALEXIS>我得挂了  回头再说
<2-7,ALEXIS>I gotta go. We'll talk about this later.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
<2-7,ALEXIS>我也爱你  拜拜
<2-7,ALEXIS>Love you, too. Bye.

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,890
<2-8,CASTLE>居然说"我们都该离家独立了"
<2-8,CASTLE>"We all need to get away from home"?

14
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,380
<2-9,ALEXIS>不  我永远都不离开
<2-9,ALEXIS>No. I should never leave.

16
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,730
<2-9,ALEXIS>我们可以上演父女版的《灰色花园》了
<2-9,ALEXIS>We can be the father-daughter version of "Grey Gardens."

17
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,040
<2-10,CASTLE>你看起来好像没怎么睡啊
<2-10,CASTLE>You look like you didn't get any sleep.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,090
<2-10,CASTLE>是没睡
<2-10,CASTLE>I didn't.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,310
<2-11,ALEXIS>阿什利接到了大学录取通知书
<2-11,ALEXIS>I mean, Ashley got his college acceptances.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,550
<2-11,ALEXIS>他差不多哪都能去
<2-11,ALEXIS>He got in everywhere.

21
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,860
<2-13,CASTLE>好啊  不好吗
<2-13,CASTLE>Well, that's great. That's not great?

22
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,090
<2-14,ALEXIS>我查看了关于高中恋人的统计数据
<2-14,ALEXIS>I looked up statistics for high-school sweethearts

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,010
<2-14,ALEXIS>当其中一个去外州上大学
<2-14,ALEXIS>when one of them goes to college out of state

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,440
<2-14,ALEXIS>另一个还留在高中上学时
<2-14,ALEXIS>and the other stays in high school.

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,170
<2-14,ALEXIS>分手的概率相当高
<2-14,ALEXIS>The odds are not in our favor.

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,480
<2-14,ALEXIS>我是说  我希望他去他想去的学校
<2-14,ALEXIS>I mean, I want him to go where he wants,

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,960
<2-14,ALEXIS>但我又不想他走  他也不想走
<2-14,ALEXIS>But I don't want him to leave, and he doesn't want to leave,

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,370
<2-14,ALEXIS>但我又不希望他因为没去成梦想中的学校而恨我
<2-14,ALEXIS>But I don't want him to resent me for not going where he wants,

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,570
<2-14,ALEXIS>我真不知道该怎么办好
<2-14,ALEXIS>and I don't know what to do.

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,310
<2-15,CASTLE>跟我学呗  概率虽小  并不代表成功无望啊
<2-15,CASTLE>Well, do what I do. Look at the odds as a challenge.

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,820
<2-16,ALEXIS>你去赌城逢赌必输  还有脸说这话
<2-16,ALEXIS>Says the man who always loses in Vegas.

32
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,150
<2-17,CASTLE>维持一段感情确是难事
<2-17,CASTLE>Relationships are hard.

33
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,040
<2-17,CASTLE>但通常来说  都会有解决之道
<2-17,CASTLE>Odds are, you'll figure it out.

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,500
<2-18,ALEXIS>通常来说  该是又有命案了
<2-18,ALEXIS>Odds are, someone's dead.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,420
<2-19,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<2-19,CASTLE>Castle.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,950
<3-1,CASTLE>开什么玩笑呢
<3-1,CASTLE>You've gotta be kidding me.

37
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,230
<3-1,CASTLE>在维拜塔酒店发生了谋杀案
<3-1,CASTLE>A murder in the theater of the V.B. Tower Hotel,

38
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,530
<3-1,CASTLE>在维克多·拜伦的地盘上
<3-1,CASTLE>Victor Baron's place?

39
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,700
<3-1,CASTLE>死者不会正是他吧
<3-1,CASTLE>It's not the Baron, is it?

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,030
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>不是  但你不会失望的
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>No, but you won't be disappointed.

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,270
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>-这个案子正合你口味呢  -何出此言
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>- This one's right up your alley. - Why is that?

42
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,460
<3-4,BECKETT>因为被害人是位选手
<3-4,BECKETT>Because our victim is a contestant.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,160
<3-5,CASTLE>选美皇后之死  听着就有猫腻啊
<3-5,CASTLE>Death of a beauty queen, scandalous.

44
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,730
<3-6,BECKETT>是啊  怎么不发生的更频繁点啊
<3-6,BECKETT>Yeah, surprised it doesn't happen more often.

45
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,160
<3-7,CASTLE>那位莫非是美国老爸  鲍比·斯塔克
<3-7,CASTLE>Is that America's dad, Bobby Stark?

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,220
<3-7,CASTLE>他在这干嘛
<3-7,CASTLE>What's he doing here?

47
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,520
<3-8,BECKETT>他是选美大赛的主持人
<3-8,BECKETT>He's the pageant host.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,580
<3-8,BECKETT>别跟我说你是他情景喜剧的观众啊
<3-8,BECKETT>Oh, please don't tell me that you watch his sitcom.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,690
<3-9,CASTLE>《家族怪癖》吗
<3-9,CASTLE>"Family Foibles"?

50
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,720
<3-9,CASTLE>我为人父的理论知识
<3-9,CASTLE>Half of what I know about being a father,

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,410
<3-9,CASTLE>一半都是从那个剧看来的
<3-9,CASTLE>I learned from watching that show.

52
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,800
<3-10,KEVIN RYAN>-嘿  贝克特  -说说事情经过
<3-10,KEVIN RYAN>- Hey, Beckett. - So what's the story?

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,040
<3-11,BECKETT>据选美负责人坎迪丝·弗德讲
<3-11,BECKETT>Well, according to Candace Ford, our pageant manager,

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,840
<3-12,RYAN>死者是21岁的安波儿·米德伯瑞
<3-12,RYAN>the victim is 21-year-old Amber Middleberry.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,940
<3-12,RYAN>选手们在彩排一个众演剧目
<3-12,RYAN>The contestants were rehearsing a production number.

56
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
<3-12,RYAN>他们把灯架降下来的时候
<3-12,RYAN>When they brought in the lighting truss,

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,390
<3-12,RYAN>安波儿就绑在上面
<3-12,RYAN>Amber was tangled up inside of it.

58
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,920
<3-14,BECKETT>-彩排被迫因此中止  -帕穆特  你好啊
<3-14,BECKETT>- Must've been a showstopper. - Hey there, Perlmutter.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,620
<3-16,BECKETT>-探长  作家  -死因是什么
<3-16,BECKETT>- Detective. Writer. - Cause of death?

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,160
<3-17,PERLMUTTER>从背后被人用她自己的肩带勒死
<3-17,PERLMUTTER>Choked from behind with her own sash,

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,440
<3-17,PERLMUTTER>死亡时间约在夜里十一点到凌晨一点间
<3-17,PERLMUTTER>Probably between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,890
<3-18,CASTLE>她怎么跑到灯架上的
<3-18,CASTLE>How did she end up on the lighting truss?

63
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,080
<3-19,RYAN>据我们推断  昨天的彩排之后
<3-19,RYAN>Near as we can tell, the, uh, lighting truss

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,440
<3-19,RYAN>灯架就留在台上了
<3-19,RYAN>was left on stage after yesterday's rehearsal.

65
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,370
<3-19,RYAN>凶手大概觉得把她扔在这上面
<3-19,RYAN>Killer probably thought he'd buy some time

66
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,390
<3-19,RYAN>升上去  可以让尸体迟一点被发现
<3-19,RYAN>by dumping her on it and raising it up to the rafters.

67
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,790
<3-20,CASTLE>那么凶手必须会使用舞台设备才行
<3-20,CASTLE>So whoever it was must have known how to use the stage equipment.

68
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,890
<3-21,RYAN>不一定  升降控制是触屏的
<3-21,RYAN>Nah, the lift controls, they're on a touch screen.

69
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,490
<3-21,RYAN>挺好操作的
<3-21,RYAN>Pretty easy to operate.

70
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,720
<3-22,BECKETT>-生前最后一次露面是什么时候  -昨晚
<3-22,BECKETT>- When was she last seen alive? - Last night.

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,660
<3-23,RYAN>所有选手都去参加向维克多·拜伦致敬的晚宴
<3-23,RYAN>Contestants, they all went to a dinner to honor Victor Baron.

72
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,100
<3-23,RYAN>十点半的时候  派对结束
<3-23,RYAN>10:30, the party wrapped,

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,960
<3-23,RYAN>他们都乘豪华轿车回到酒店
<3-23,RYAN>and they were all limoed back here to the hotel.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,610
<3-23,RYAN>安波儿在10:43时使用过房卡进入自己的房间
<3-23,RYAN>Amber used her key card at 10:43 p.m. to get into her hotel room.

75
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,890
<3-23,RYAN>之后就跑到这来了
<3-23,RYAN>After that, she, uh, wound up here.

76
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,360
<3-24,PERLMUTTER>探长  你该看看这个
<3-24,PERLMUTTER>Detective, there's something you should see.

77
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,170
<3-25,BECKETT>黑色小亮片
<3-25,BECKETT>A black sequin?

78
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,430
<3-26,PERLMUTTER>是亮片的一部分  她头发里发现的
<3-26,PERLMUTTER>Part of one. I found it in her hair.

79
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,980
<3-27,BECKETT>好的  可能是凶手勒死她的时候
<3-27,BECKETT>Okay, so the killer might have transferred it

80
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,560
<3-27,BECKETT>落在她身上了
<3-27,BECKETT>when he strangled her.

81
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,280
<3-27,BECKETT>我们去查查昨晚都谁能进这个舞厅
<3-27,BECKETT>Let's find out who had access to this ballroom last night.

82
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,090
<3-27,BECKETT>再跟选美负责人谈谈
<3-27,BECKETT>And let's also talk to the pageant manager.

83
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,310
<3-27,BECKETT>查查看有没有哪个女孩的服装
<3-27,BECKETT>I want to see if any of the girls' outfits

84
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,110
<3-28,RYAN>-能跟这个亮片匹配上  -好的
<3-28,RYAN>- match with this sequin. - Will do.

85
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,430
<3-29,BECKETT>安波儿·米德伯瑞有亲人吗
<3-29,BECKETT>So does Amber Middleberry have any family?

86
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,810
<3-30,RYAN>有  只有  她爸爸
<3-30,RYAN>Yeah. Just her, uh, dad.

87
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,880
<3-30,RYAN>她从九岁开始选美
<3-30,RYAN>She started when she was 9...

<4-1,DAN>Oh, I was against the whole idea at first,

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,780
<4-1,DAN>但是安波儿的妈妈却非常热衷于此
<4-1,DAN>but Amber's mom had a bug about it, and, uh,

91
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,930
<4-1,DAN>她妈妈去世后
<4-1,DAN>and after her mother died...

92
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,060
<4-1,DAN>我想选美可以抚慰她对母亲的思念
<4-1,DAN>I think it just helped her feel closer to her.

93
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,560
<4-2,BECKETT>你知道你女儿有什么仇人吗
<4-2,BECKETT>Did your daughter have any enemies that you know of?

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
<4-3,DAN>没有  当然没有  大家都很喜欢安波儿
<4-3,DAN>No, of course not. Everybody loved Amber.

<4-4,CASTLE>那其他的选手呢
<4-4,CASTLE>Well, what about the other contestants?

<4-5,DAN>她们  甚至在她进入半决赛后
<4-5,DAN>They, even after she made it to the semifinals,

99
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,380
<4-5,DAN>大家都来拥抱她  她们都...
<4-5,DAN>everybody was hugging her, and they were...

100
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,660
<4-5,DAN>她们都说她是"先锋美后'呢
<4-5,DAN>they were calling her the front-runner, and, uh...

101

105
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,590
<4-7,DAN>想祝她好运
<4-7,DAN>I wanted to wish her luck, you know,

106
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,130
<4-7,DAN>她却没接电话
<4-7,DAN>but... she didn't answer the phone.

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,140
<4-8,BECKETT>那是什么时候的事
<4-8,BECKETT>And what time was that?

108
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,810
<4-9,DAN>11点不到
<4-9,DAN>A little before 11:00.

109
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,960
<4-9,DAN>我以为她一定是睡了
<4-9,DAN>I, uh... I thought she must have gone to sleep,

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,930
<4-9,DAN>但她肯定是离开她的房间
<4-9,DAN>but she must have left her room

111
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,270
<4-9,DAN>不知为什么跑到这来了
<4-9,DAN>and come down here for some reason.

112
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,720
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>Dan
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>Dan.

113
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,970
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>我真难过
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>I am so sorry.

114
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,600
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>我们一定会抓到丧尽天良的凶手
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>We're gonna get the bastard who did this.

115
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,960
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>-我保证  -谢谢你  拜伦先生
<4-10,VICTOR BARON>- You have my word. - Thank you, Mr. Baron.

116

<4-12,BARON>探长  不介意的话  我们楼上说话
<4-12,BARON>Detectives, a word upstairs if you don't mind.

117
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,710
<5-1,BARON>今天是沉痛的一天
<5-1,BARON>This is a dark day.

118
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,330
<5-1,BARON>拜伦全美选美大赛历史上悲痛的一页
<5-1,BARON>A sad chapter in the history of Baron's All-American Beauty Pageant.

119
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,290
<5-2,KAYLA BARON>维克多  真是太可怕了
<5-2,KAYLA BARON>Victor, this is just awful.

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,010
<5-3,BARON>内人凯拉
<5-3,BARON>My wife Kayla.

121
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,270
<5-3,BARON>你们或许也认识她
<5-3,BARON>You might recognize her

122
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,330
<5-3,BARON>-95年摘得拜伦全美小姐桂冠  -久闻了
<5-3,BARON>- as Baron's All-American Beauty, 1995. - Yes, of course.

123
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,250
<5-5,BECKETT>见到你很高兴
<5-5,BECKETT>Nice to meet you.

124
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,390
<5-5,BECKETT>见到你很高兴
<5-5,BECKETT>Nice to meet you, yes.

125
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,470
<5-6,KAYLA>这真是令人心碎  对我们  对其他女孩都是的
<5-6,KAYLA>This is just devastating, for us and... and for the girls.

126
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,090
<5-6,KAYLA>我们就像一家人
<5-6,KAYLA>We... we're like family.

127
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,540
<5-7,CASTLE>你们有多了解她
<5-7,CASTLE>How well did you know her?

128
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,210
<5-8,BARON>她是个很甜美的女孩  出色的小提琴手
<5-8,BARON>Um, sh-she was a sweet girl, a hell of a violinist.

129
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:50,970
<5-9,KAYLA>是的
<5-9,KAYLA>Yes, she was.

130
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,760
<5-10,BARON>请记住我说的  我将倾尽拜伦帝国全部的力量
<5-10,BARON>Mark my words--I am putting the entire weight

131
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,180
<5-10,BARON>来支持此次调查
<5-10,BARON>of the Baron empire behind this investigation.

132
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,370
<5-10,BARON>任何需要  尽管开口
<5-10,BARON>Anything you need, just say the word.

133
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,910
<5-10,BARON>探长  我知道  你必须秉公执法
<5-10,BARON>Detective, I know, uh, you have to do your thing.

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,610
<5-10,BARON>我只是希望
<5-10,BARON>Uh, I'm just hoping,

135
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,390
<5-10,BARON>因为本周五我们将会直播本次选美
<5-10,BARON>Uh, since we are airing the pageant live this Friday,

136
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,730
<5-10,BARON>如果能减少媒体曝光度  你明白的
<5-10,BARON>if we could minimize the press, you know,

137
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,220
<5-10,BARON>对其他女孩们公平一些
<5-10,BARON>to be fair to the other girls.

138
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,650
<5-11,BECKETT>我们会先为受害人寻求公平
<5-11,BECKETT>We're gonna have to be fair to our victim first.

139
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,250
<5-11,BECKETT>说到媒体  可以把摄像头都关了吗
<5-11,BECKETT>And speaking of press, could we get rid of the cameras?

140
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,230
<5-11,BECKETT>这  毕竟是一起谋杀案的调查
<5-11,BECKETT>This is, after all, a murder investigation,

141
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,200
<5-11,BECKETT>而不是真人秀
<5-11,BECKETT>not a reality show.

142
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,650
<5-12,BARON>我们  我们录下选美幕后
<5-12,BARON>We, um, we film everything...

143
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,710
<5-12,BARON>所有的场景
<5-12,BARON>behind the scenes at the pageant.

144
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,100
<5-12,BARON>我们希望捕捉到女孩们对彼此的看法
<5-12,BARON>We like to catch the girls talking about each other,

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,460
<5-12,BARON>让她们畅谈心中的希望和恐惧
<5-12,BARON>let them confess their hopes and fears.

146
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,880
<5-12,BARON>明星光环头顶绕  幕后斗争不能少
<5-12,BARON>You get the glamour, but you also get the underbelly.

147
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,520
<5-13,KAYLA>-观众们最爱看幕后"花絮"了  -没错
<5-13,KAYLA>- People love the underbelly. - Yes, they do.

148
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,710
<5-14,BARON>或许现在该停止拍摄才对
<5-14,BARON>But maybe this isn't the time.

149
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,890
<5-15,BECKETT>那么所有的女孩都住在酒店吗
<5-15,BECKETT>So were all the girls staying at the hotel?

150
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,910
<5-16,BARON>-是这样的  -好的  我需要去安波儿的房间看看
<5-16,BARON>- That's right. - Okay, I'll need access to Amber's room.

151
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,490
<5-17,BECKETT>我们还需要酒店的监控录像带
<5-17,BECKETT>We'll also need hotel security tapes.

152
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,090
<5-17,BECKETT>那些摄像机都录下昨天的晚宴了吗
<5-17,BECKETT>Now were those cameras recording last night's dinner?

153
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,900
<5-18,BARON>当然
<5-18,BARON>Of course.

154
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,800
<5-19,BECKETT>我们需要录影带
<5-19,BECKETT>Okay, we'll need the footage.

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,900
<5-19,BECKETT>还需要询问本次选美的所有参赛者
<5-19,BECKETT>We'll also need to interview all of the pageant contestants.

156
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,640
<5-20,BARON>我会让坎迪丝满足你们的一切所需
<5-20,BARON>I'll have Candace give you anything you need.

157
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,650
<5-21,BECKETT>很好  非常感谢您
<5-21,BECKETT>Great. Thank you very much.

158
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,400
<5-21,BECKETT>-很高兴见到你  -欢迎下次再来
<5-21,BECKETT>- It was nice to meet you. - Come again.

159
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,640
<5-22,KAYLA>不  我们不要
<5-22,KAYLA>Oh, no, we don't--

160
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,900
<5-23,BARON>我们不想他们再来了
<5-23,BARON>We don't want them to come again.

161
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,520
<6-1,CASTLE>小镇姑娘为了童话故事来到纽约
<6-1,CASTLE>Small-town girl comes to New York for the fairy tale,

162
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,950
<6-1,CASTLE>却以恐怖故事结尾
<6-1,CASTLE>ends up with the horror story.

163
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,400
<6-2,BECKETT>选美不是童话故事
<6-2,BECKETT>Pageants aren't fairy tales.

164
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,440
<6-2,BECKETT>而是一项高要求  高压力的比赛
<6-2,BECKETT>They're demanding, high-pressure competitions

165
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,510
<6-2,BECKETT>将人性中最闪亮的和最黑暗的特质都发掘出来
<6-2,BECKETT>that bring out the very best and the very worst in people.

166
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,070
<6-3,CASTLE>听起来真是经验之谈啊
<6-3,CASTLE>That is the voice of experience.

167
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,820
<6-3,CASTLE>我的天  你是选美皇后
<6-3,CASTLE>Oh, my god. You were a beauty queen.

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,460
<6-4,BECKETT>不是  大一时我有个舍友叫黛比·文妮科
<6-4,BECKETT>No. I had a roommate freshman year--Debbie Winokur.

169
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,420
<6-4,BECKETT>就像是和服用类固醇的艾丽·伍兹生活在一起
<6-4,BECKETT>It was like living with Elle Woods on steroids.

171
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,850
<6-4,BECKETT>那么...
<6-4,BECKETT>Well, then...

172
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,570
<6-5,CASTLE>这场景应该会唤起不少回忆吧
<6-5,CASTLE>This ought to bring back some memories.

173
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,330
<6-6,PAGEANT MOM>你太没精打采了  冠军永远不会没精打采的
<6-6,PAGEANT MOM>You're slouching. Winners never slouch.

174
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,860
<6-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  到处都是
<6-7,BECKETT>Castle, they're everywhere.

175
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,540
<6-8,CASTLE>闻起来就像百货公司里的香水柜台
<6-8,CASTLE>Smells like a perfume counter at a department store.

176
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,920
<6-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>比平常办案遇到的无赖疯子等劲爆多了
<6-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Beats the usual lowlifes and nut jobs.

177
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,840
<6-10,BECKETT>不知道你是否可以改正偏见
<6-10,BECKETT>I don't know if you can say

178
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,200
<6-10,BECKETT>疯子和选美皇后是完全不搭边的
<6-10,BECKETT>that nut jobs and beauty queens are mutually exclusive.

179
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,630
<6-11,ESPOSITO>是的  但是她们都与谋杀案无关
<6-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but none of 'em connect to the murder.

180
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,500
<6-11,ESPOSITO>我检查了她们衣服上的小亮片
<6-11,ESPOSITO>I checked the sequin against all their dresses...

181
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,490
<6-12,CASTLE>趁机揩油了吧
<6-12,CASTLE>I bet you did.

182
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,720
<6-13,ESPOSITO>没有相匹配的
<6-13,ESPOSITO>And none of 'em are a match.

183
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,880
<6-14,BECKETT>好吧  看一下晚宴的录像
<6-14,BECKETT>Okay, look at the footage from the dinner.

184
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,190

<6-14,BECKETT>Let's make sure that the dresses we checked

<6-14,BECKETT>确实是她们昨天穿的
<6-14,BECKETT>are the ones they actually wore.

186
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,360
<6-15,ESPOSITO>观看美女们穿着晚礼服走动吗
<6-15,ESPOSITO>Watch a parade of beautiful women in evening attire?

187
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,970
<6-15,ESPOSITO>好  交给我吧
<6-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I can do that.

188
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:56,860
<6-16,CASTLE>那是当然
<6-16,CASTLE>I bet you can.

189
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,260
<6-17,RYAN>嘿  我将这些女孩们都询问了一遍
<6-17,RYAN>Hey, so I've been interviewing these ladies...

190
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,080
<6-18,CASTLE>那是当然
<6-18,CASTLE>I bet you did.

191

<6-19,RYAN>About their alibis last night.

192
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,520
<6-19,RYAN>总之  有个人你们应该去和她谈谈
<6-19,RYAN>Anyway, there's someone that you should talk to.

193
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,770
<6-19,RYAN>告诉他们
<6-19,RYAN>so tell 'em

194

<7-1,RYAN>你刚刚告诉我的晚宴后发生的事情
<7-1,RYAN>what you told me about what happened after dinner.

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,330
<7-2,SASCHA>当我们回到酒店
<7-2,SASCHA>When we got back to the hotel,

196
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,630
<7-2,SASCHA>我想要练习一组舞蹈动作
<7-2,SASCHA>I wanted to go work out a couple of my dance moves.

197
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,000
<7-2,SASCHA>我是半决赛选手之一  所以我在节目中有表演项目
<7-2,SASCHA>I'm one of the semifinalists, so I get to perform in the broadcast.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,180
<7-3,CASTLE>祝贺你
<7-3,CASTLE>Congratulations.

<7-4,SASCHA>Thanks. I'm doing an interpretive dance

200
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,470
<7-4,SASCHA>詹妮弗·洛佩慈的歌曲《我喜欢你》
<7-4,SASCHA>to Jlo's "I'm into you."

201
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,260
<7-5,BECKETT>然后发生了什么
<7-5,BECKETT>And then what happened?

202
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,400
<7-6,SASCHA>我换了运动服  来到了舞台
<7-6,SASCHA>I changed into sweats and went to the stage,

203
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,970
<7-6,SASCHA>然后我就听到了
<7-6,SASCHA>and that's when I heard it.

204
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,740
<7-7,BECKETT>听到什么了
<7-7,BECKETT>You heard what?

205
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,780
<7-8,SASCHA>吵架
<7-8,SASCHA>Uh, a fight.

206
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,660
<7-8,SASCHA>是从更衣室传来的
<7-8,SASCHA>It was coming from the dressing room.

207
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,150
<7-8,SASCHA>是安波儿和一个男人
<7-8,SASCHA>It was Amber and some guy.

208
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,930
<7-9,CASTLE>-你看到是谁了吗  -门是关着的
<7-9,CASTLE>- Did you see the guy? - The door was closed.

209
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,940
<7-10,SASCHA>声音越来越大  所以我就锁了门
<7-10,SASCHA>It started getting loud, so I bolted.

210
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,000
<7-10,SASCHA>但现在我希望我当时能做点什么
<7-10,SASCHA>But now I wish I had done something.

211
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:56,330
<7-10,SASCHA>也许他就是杀她的凶手
<7-10,SASCHA>I mean... Maybe he's the one who killed her.

212
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,900
<7-11,BECKETT>他的声音  你能听出是谁吗
<7-11,BECKETT>His voice, did you recognize it?

213
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,760
<7-12,SASCHA>不能
<7-12,SASCHA>No.

214
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,020
<7-13,CASTLE>他们在吵什么
<7-13,CASTLE>What were they arguing about?

215
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,020
<7-14,SASCHA>"你怎么可以这样对我  你没权力
<7-14,SASCHA>"How could you do this to me? You have no right.

216
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,180
<7-14,SASCHA>你以为你是谁"  这一类的
<7-14,SASCHA>Who do you think you are?" Stuff like that.

217
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,660
<7-14,SASCHA>听起来他有点像是她男朋友
<7-14,SASCHA>It kinda sounded like he was her boyfriend.

218
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,650
<7-14,SASCHA>刚刚是安波儿的爸爸
<7-14,SASCHA>So that was Amber's dad.

219
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,330
<8-1,RYAN>他说他不知道女儿有交男朋友
<8-1,RYAN>He said he didn't know anything about a boyfriend.

220
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,720
<8-1,RYAN>其他女孩也表示不知情
<8-1,RYAN>Neither did any of the other girls.

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,280
<8-2,CASTLE>也许她进行的是地下恋情
<8-2,CASTLE>Maybe she was keeping it a secret.

222
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,270
<8-3,RYAN>他说  只有一个人知道安波儿的私生活情况
<8-3,RYAN>He said, if anyone knew what was going on in Amber's life,

223
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,980
<8-3,RYAN>就是贾斯汀·汉克尔 安波儿的选美顾问
<8-3,RYAN>it was, uh, Justin Hankel, Amber's pageant consultant.

224
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,440
<8-3,RYAN>我安排她的日常生活  采访
<8-3,RYAN>I coached her on her routine, interviews,

225
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,820
<8-3,RYAN>监督她的造型  化妆  衣服  小提琴课
<8-3,RYAN>oversaw stylists, makeup, clothing, violin lessons,

226
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,010
<9-1,JUSTIN HANKEL>魅力展示  赢得比赛所需的一切努力
<9-1,JUSTIN HANKEL>glamour shots-- everything she needed to win.

227
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,370
<9-2,BECKETT>你们俩一定有很多时间在一起
<9-2,BECKETT>The two of you must have spent a lot of time together.

228
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,630
<9-3,JUSTIN>那是必须的
<9-3,JUSTIN>Well, that's what it takes.

229
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,450
<9-3,JUSTIN>现在的选美不仅仅是漂亮就行的
<9-3,JUSTIN>Today's pageants are not just about beauty.

230
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,350
<9-3,JUSTIN>更关乎头脑  才艺  社交能力
<9-3,JUSTIN>They're about brains, talent, social issues.

231
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,310
<9-3,JUSTIN>一旦当选  奖金和媒体曝光度  实在诱惑
<9-3,JUSTIN>and what, with the money and the exposure at stake,

232
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,140
<9-3,JUSTIN>赢得任意一项就可以开启成功的事业
<9-3,JUSTIN>Winning one of the majors can launch a career.

233
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,840
<9-4,BECKETT>那男朋友呢  她恋爱了吗
<9-4,BECKETT>What about a boyfriend? Was she in a relationship?

234
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,840
<9-5,JUSTIN>没有男朋友  这是我对客户的要求之一
<9-5,JUSTIN>No boyfriends. That is a rule for my clients,

235
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,410
<9-5,JUSTIN>安波儿也不例外
<9-5,JUSTIN>And Amber was no exception.

236
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,640
<9-5,JUSTIN>她知道她必须要把精力全部用在选美上
<9-5,JUSTIN>She knew that she needed to focus 100% of her energy on the pageant.

237
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,610
<9-6,BECKETT>你知道吗  她死的那晚  和别人吵了一架
<9-6,BECKETT>You know, the night that she died, she got into an argument.

238
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,020
<9-6,BECKETT>知道和谁吗
<9-6,BECKETT>Any idea with who?

239
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,090
<9-7,JUSTIN>不  我最后见到她是在晚宴前
<9-7,JUSTIN>No. The last time I saw her was before her dinner.

240
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,910
<9-7,JUSTIN>但是正如我对另外那名警官所说
<9-7,JUSTIN>But like I told that other detective,

241
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,830
<9-7,JUSTIN>肯定有什么事
<9-7,JUSTIN>something was going on.

242
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,060
<9-8,BECKETT>何出此言
<9-8,BECKETT>How so?

243
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,500
<9-9,JUSTIN>她最近几天都不在状态  心烦意乱
<9-9,JUSTIN>She'd been off the last couple of days, upset.

244
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,900
<9-9,JUSTIN>我接她去试衣服的时候
<9-9,JUSTIN>And I went to pick her up for a costume fitting,

245
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,560
<9-9,JUSTIN>她看起来好像刚刚哭过
<9-9,JUSTIN>and it looked like she had been crying.

246
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,810
<9-10,CASTLE>你有没有问她为什么
<9-10,CASTLE>Did you ask why?

247
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,290
<9-11,JUSTIN>她说有人想占她便宜
<9-11,JUSTIN>She said that someone was trying to take advantage of her.

248
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,010
<9-11,JUSTIN>我问了是谁  但是她说她会处理好的
<9-11,JUSTIN>I asked her who, but she said she would handle it.

249
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,230
<9-11,JUSTIN>不对我说实话  这点不像她
<9-11,JUSTIN>It j--it wasn't like her not to confide in me.

250
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,360
<9-12,CASTLE>会不会是其他的参赛者
<9-12,CASTLE>Could it have been one of the other contestants?

251
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,260
<9-13,JUSTIN>这些女孩为了赢得比赛都承受着巨大压力
<9-13,JUSTIN>There's a lot of pressure on these girls to win.

252
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,230
<9-13,JUSTIN>她们之间的关系也很阴暗复杂
<9-13,JUSTIN>And it can get really... "political" between them.

253
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,320
<10-1,CASTLE>阴暗复杂的关系有没有可能最终让她丧命呢
<10-1,CASTLE>Do you think it's possible political turned deadly?

254
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,090
<10-2,BECKETT>我不知道  夺冠意味着获得名声和财富
<10-2,BECKETT>I don't know. Winning means fame and fortune.

255
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,890
<10-2,BECKETT>没人会关注第二名
<10-2,BECKETT>No one remembers the runner-up.

256
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,550
<10-2,BECKETT>再说了  比这更弱的动机都能让人萌生杀机
<10-2,BECKETT>Besides, people have killed for less.

257
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,740
<10-3,CASTLE>那还是没法解释她和谁吵架
<10-3,CASTLE>That still doesn't explain who she was arguing with.

258
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,130
<10-4,ESPOSITO>伙计们  我有线索了
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Guys. I got something.

259
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,400
<10-5,BECKETT>是其中一个女孩吗
<10-5,BECKETT>One of the girls?

260
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,510
<10-6,ESPOSITO>-先看着  -我还是小女孩的时候
<10-6,ESPOSITO>- Just watch. Ever since I was a little girl...

261
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,940
<10-7,ESPOSITO>这是昨晚拜伦晚宴的录像
<10-7,ESPOSITO>This is from Baron's dinner last night.

262
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,570
<10-7,ESPOSITO>那是我们的被害人安波儿
<10-7,ESPOSITO>That's our victim, Amber.

263
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,410
<10-7,ESPOSITO>我很荣幸能来到这里
<10-7,ESPOSITO>And I just feel so very honored to be here.

264
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,460
<10-7,ESPOSITO>她在拍维克多·拜伦的马屁
<10-7,ESPOSITO>She's laying it on thick for Victor Baron.

265
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,340
<10-7,ESPOSITO>但是  那还不是最有意思的部分
<10-7,ESPOSITO>But that's not the interesting part.

266
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,000
<10-7,ESPOSITO>再看看这个
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Now watch this.

267
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,220
<10-7,ESPOSITO>这里
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Ah. There.

268
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
<10-7,ESPOSITO>看到了吗
<10-7,ESPOSITO>See that?

269
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,610
<10-8,CASTLE>看她的脸
<10-8,CASTLE>Look at her face.

270
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,170
<10-9,BECKETT>看起来不论情景喜剧之星鲍比·斯塔克说了什么
<10-9,BECKETT>Looks like whatever good-guy sitcom star Bobby Stark said,

271
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,710
<10-9,BECKETT>她都不喜欢
<10-9,BECKETT>she didn't like it.

272
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
<10-10,ESPOSITO>别光看她的脸
<10-10,ESPOSITO>Don't just look at her face.

273
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,810
<10-10,ESPOSITO>看看他的晚礼服
<10-10,ESPOSITO>Look at his tux.

274
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,420
<10-11,BECKETT>黑色小亮片
<10-11,BECKETT>Black sequins.

277
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:49,180
<10-11,BECKETT>翻译：千花  旺妹  媛媛  DJ  LyraL  米苏  落末一地

278
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,860
<11-1,ESPOSITO>鲍比·斯塔克的礼服
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Bobby Stark's blazer,

279
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,630
<11-1,ESPOSITO>多亏了选美大赛的服装师
<11-1,ESPOSITO>courtesy of the costume lady at the pageant.

280
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,680
<11-2,BECKETT>-毁坏的黑色亮片呢  -完全吻合
<11-2,BECKETT>-And the broken black sequin? - Perfect match.

281
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,630
<11-4,CASTLE>服装师爆粗  弄坏衣服  真是混蛋
<11-4,CASTLE>Bam, said the costume lady.

283
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,060
<11-5,RYAN>她不是唯一一个提到鲍比·斯塔克时
<11-5,RYAN>Ooh, she's not the only lady saying bam

284
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,160
<11-6,BECKETT>-骂脏话的  -他有前科吗
<11-6,BECKETT>- When it comes to Bobby Stark. - Does he have a record?

285
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
<11-7,RYAN>没有刑事指控
<11-7,RYAN>Uh, no criminal charges,

286
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,700
<11-7,RYAN>但斯塔克名声相当不好
<11-7,RYAN>But Mr. Stark has quite the reputation.

287
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,190
<11-7,RYAN>去年有三名女子申请了对他的限制令
<11-7,RYAN>Three women filed restraining orders against Bobby Stark in the last year

288
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,570
<11-7,RYAN>理由都是骚扰挑逗
<11-7,RYAN>all for unwanted advances.

289
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,130
<11-8,CASTLE>怎么名人八卦网上没这消息
<11-8,CASTLE>How come I didn't hear about this on "TMZ"?

290
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,600
<11-9,RYAN>据说斯塔克付了
<11-9,RYAN>Oh, word is Stark paid

291
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
<11-9,RYAN>一大笔钱封锁消息
<11-9,RYAN>Quite a bit of cash to make it all go away.

292
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,470
<11-9,RYAN>更精彩的在后面呢  我和坎迪丝·弗德
<11-9,RYAN>Oh, it gets better. I was talking to Candace Ford

293
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,600
<11-9,RYAN>及其他几个女孩交谈时
<11-9,RYAN>and a couple of the other girls.

294
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,880
<11-9,RYAN>大家都称鲍比·斯塔克
<11-9,RYAN>They said that Bobby Stark had started paying

295
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,100
<11-9,RYAN>对安波儿相当关注
<11-9,RYAN>quite a lot of attention to Amber.

296
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,130
<11-10,CASTLE>可能关注过头了吧
<11-10,CASTLE>Maybe it was unwanted attention.

297
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,210
<11-11,BECKETT>也许鲍比不懂拒绝是什么意思
<11-11,BECKETT>Maybe Bobby didn't know how to take no for an answer.

298
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,090
<12-1,BOBBY>你在看我吗
<12-1,BOBBY>you lookin' at me? Hmm?

299
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,370
<12-1,BOBBY>-你在看我吗  -斯塔克先生  我是探长
<12-1,BOBBY>- You lookin' at me? - Mr. Stark, I'm detective--

300
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,370
<12-3,BOBBY>周围没有别人  你一定是在看我
<12-3,BOBBY>Nobody else around. You must be lookin' at me.

301
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,970
<12-4,BECKETT>-斯塔克先生  -嗯
<12-4,BECKETT>- Mr. Stark. - Hmm?

302
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,750
<12-5,BECKETT>-请坐  -你觉得刚才那个怎样
<12-5,BECKETT>- Have a seat, please. - Yeah. Hey, you like that bit?

304
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,110
<12-6,BOBBY>我在学罗伯特·迪尼洛
<12-6,BOBBY>That's my, uh, Bobby De Niro.

306
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,220
<12-7,CASTLE>扮演一个杀人狂
<12-7,CASTLE>Playing a homicidal maniac.

307
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,540
<12-8,BOBBY>很像吧
<12-8,BOBBY>Sold it though, right?

308
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,630
<12-8,BOBBY>瞧  我还能演反派
<12-8,BOBBY>See, I got this range as an actor.

309
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,450
<12-8,BOBBY>这你可能不知道
<12-8,BOBBY>You probably don't know about that

310
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,380
<12-8,BOBBY>因为我通常都是以好爸爸的角色形象示人
<12-8,BOBBY>because I'm always typecast as Mr. Nice-guy dad.

311
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,600
<12-9,BECKETT>我倒不怀疑你有那本事
<12-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I don't think you'll have that problem

312
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,140
<12-9,BECKETT>作为谋杀嫌疑人  你装的还挺像
<12-9,BECKETT>now that you're a murder suspect.

313
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,040
<12-10,BOBBY>谋杀嫌疑人  什么  你开玩笑吧
<12-10,BOBBY>Murder suspect? What? Is she joking? You joking?

314
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,920
<12-11,BECKETT>你跟安波儿·米德伯瑞是什么关系
<12-11,BECKETT>What was your relationship with Amber Middleberry?

315
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,390
<12-11,BECKETT>不是吧  你来真的吗  我没有杀她
<12-11,BECKETT>Oh, come on. Are you serious? I didn't kill her.

316
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,020
<12-12,BOBBY>要真说有什么  我也就是想招募她
<12-12,BOBBY>If anything, I was trying to recruit her.

317
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,400
<12-14,BOBBY>-招她干嘛  -招她来我的女神号列车
<12-14,BOBBY>- Recruit her? For what? - Yeah, for my, uh, Goddess Train.

318
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,360
<12-16,BOBBY>-女神号列车  -我的一个小型选美节目
<12-16,BOBBY>-The Goddess Train? - It's my own little private pageant.

319
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,430
<12-17,BECKETT>安波儿是如何答复这个诱人不已的邀请的
<12-17,BECKETT>And how did Amber respond to this oh-so-enticing offer?

320
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,250
<12-18,BOBBY>坦白说  她还没想通  但已经快了
<12-18,BOBBY>You know what? She hadn't seen the light yet, but she was coming around.

321
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,220
<12-18,BOBBY>我一眼就能发现谁大有星途
<12-18,BOBBY>I could always tell the innocent act when I see it.

322
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,980
<12-18,BOBBY>再说了 谁不想借我鲍比一举成名
<12-18,BOBBY>Besides, who wouldn't want to ride the Bobby rocket?

323
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,500
<12-19,CASTLE>据我们所知谁都不想
<12-19,CASTLE>Everyone from what we hear.

324
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,920
<12-19,CASTLE>斯塔克先生  我觉得是这么回事
<12-19,CASTLE>Mr. Stark, here's what I think happened--

325
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
<12-20,BECKETT>晚餐后  你叫安波儿去了你的更衣室
<12-20,BECKETT>After dinner, you invited Amber back to your dressing room,

326
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,650
<12-20,BECKETT>她拒绝了你的提议
<12-20,BECKETT>and she had the bad sense to agree.

327
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,460
<12-20,BECKETT>因此你想用别的办法
<12-20,BECKETT>And that's when you tried to make another pitch

328
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,500
<12-21,CASTLE>-逼她就范  -但她坚决不从
<12-21,CASTLE>- to get her on board your Goddess Train. - When she shot you down,

329
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,210
<12-21,CASTLE>于是你恼羞成怒扼死了她
<12-21,CASTLE>you flew into a rage and you strangled her.

330
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,800
<12-22,BECKETT>你在那个舞台上彩排了一整周
<12-22,BECKETT>You were rehearsing on that stage all week.

331
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,670
<12-22,BECKETT>-了解所有设备  -打住
<12-22,BECKETT>-You knew all of the equipment-- - just stop.

332
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,760
<12-23,BOBBY>你先打住好吗
<12-23,BOBBY>Would you just--just stop?

333
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,790
<12-23,BOBBY>不觉得你们疯了吗
<12-23,BOBBY>You guys are crazy, you know that?

334
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,310
<12-24,BECKETT>那也许你能解释一下
<12-24,BECKETT>Okay, well, then maybe you can explain

335
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,610
<12-24,BECKETT>为什么你外套上掉下的这个小亮片
<12-24,BECKETT>why we found this broken sequin from your jacket

336
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,360
<12-24,BECKETT>会在她身上呢
<12-24,BECKETT>on her body.

337
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,740
<12-24,BECKETT>昨晚11点到凌晨1点你在哪里
<12-24,BECKETT>Where were you between 11:00 and 1:00 a.m. last night?

338
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,100
<12-25,BOBBY>我不知道
<12-25,BOBBY>Uh... I don't know.

339
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,720
<12-25,BOBBY>说真的我印象很模糊
<12-25,BOBBY>I'm a little foggy on that, actually.

340
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,660
<12-25,BOBBY>-我玩得太厉害  -跟谁一起
<12-25,BOBBY>-I was, uh, partying pretty hard. - Who were you with?

341
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,130
<12-27,BOBBY>我不太清楚  但是
<12-27,BOBBY>I'm not sure, but...

342
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,120
<12-27,BOBBY>不管是谁  我们当时肯定用了草莓油
<12-27,BOBBY>whoever it was, we were definitely using strawberry oil.

343
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,670
<12-28,BECKETT>那说白了
<12-28,BECKETT>Okay, so let me get this straight.

344
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,220
<12-28,BECKETT>你昨晚既不知道自己在哪儿
<12-28,BECKETT>You don't remember where you were

345
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,310
<12-28,BECKETT>也不知道自己在干嘛是吧
<12-28,BECKETT>or what you were doing last night?

346
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,080
<12-29,BOBBY>这很糟糕  是吧
<12-29,BOBBY>That's bad, right?

347
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,240
<13-1,BECKETT>那家伙吞的药丸够开个药店了
<13-1,BECKETT>That guy's dropped more pills than a 3-fingered pharmacist.

348
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
<13-2,CASTLE>我实在无法相信一个在电视上
<13-2,CASTLE>I just can't believe that someone who's given

349
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,220
<13-2,CASTLE>扮演慈父的人会杀人
<13-2,CASTLE>so much great fatherly advice on TV could be guilty of murder.

350
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,510
<13-3,BECKETT>他是个嗑药上瘾的色狼
<13-3,BECKETT>Well, he's a drug-addled predator

351
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,310
<13-3,BECKETT>还不小心在尸体上留下了证据
<13-3,BECKETT>Who left physical evidence on the body.

352
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,680
<13-4,CASTLE>好吧  你非要这么说...
<13-4,CASTLE>Well, when you put it that way...

353
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,820
<13-5,BECKETT>-埃斯波西托  -在
<13-5,BECKETT>- Hey, Esposito. - Yo.

354
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,480
<13-6,ESPOSITO>我们要查一下斯塔克那晚的行踪
<13-6,ESPOSITO>We need to reconstruct Stark's evening.

355
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,070
<13-7,BECKETT>查下他的通话记录  仔细查查酒店的监控录像
<13-7,BECKETT>Check his phone records, double-check security cameras at the hotel.

356
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,940
<13-7,BECKETT>我们需要确切证据  证明他出现在犯罪现场
<13-7,BECKETT>We need hard evidence to place him at the crime scene.

357
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,490
<13-8,ESPOSITO>我找到点东西可能有所帮助
<13-8,ESPOSITO>I got something that might help.

358
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,170
<13-8,ESPOSITO>安波儿吃晚餐时带着她的小提琴
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Amber had her violin with her at dinner,

359
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,280
<13-8,ESPOSITO>但在她尸体边和
<13-8,ESPOSITO>But it wasn't with the body

360
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,870
<13-8,ESPOSITO>-案发现场任何地方都没有  -那小提琴去哪儿了
<13-8,ESPOSITO>- or anywhere at the crime scene. - So where'd it go?

361
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,240
<13-10,BECKETT>安波儿去过酒店
<13-10,BECKETT>Well, we know Amber went to the hotel,

362
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,850
<13-10,BECKETT>她可能放在房里了
<13-10,BECKETT>so maybe she dropped it off there.

363
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,240
<13-11,ESPOSITO>但警察搜过酒店房间  不在那儿
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Except uniforms inventoried the room. It wasn't there,

364
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,170
<13-11,ESPOSITO>她父亲和顾问也没见到
<13-11,ESPOSITO>and her dad and consultant didn't see it either.

365
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,560
<13-12,CASTLE>那也许她被杀的时候还带着它
<13-12,CASTLE>So maybe she had it when she was killed.

366
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,760
<13-13,BECKETT>后来被鲍比·斯塔克处理掉了
<13-13,BECKETT>And Bobby Stark disposed of it.

367
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,010
<13-13,BECKETT>查查酒店附近的垃圾桶  垃圾车  下水道
<13-13,BECKETT>Check trash cans, dumpsters, and sewer drains by the hotel.

368
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,100
<13-13,BECKETT>如果有人见到他丢弃小提琴
<13-13,BECKETT>If someone saw him ditch the violin,

369
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,730
<13-13,BECKETT>-我们就能将他与谋杀联系起来  -这就去
<13-13,BECKETT>- we can connect him to the murder. - Right on.

370
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,710
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>选美盛会的勾心斗角
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, beauty pageant intrigue.

371
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,890
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>司空见惯的故事了
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Some things never change. Ah!

372
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,550
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>噢  找到了
<14-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, here it is.

373
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,160
<14-2,CASTLE>-我不知道你参加过  -那是因为我没胜出
<14-2,CASTLE>- I didn't know you competed. - Well, that's because I didn't win.

374
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,150
<14-4,CASTLE>但我告诉你  我们那时的竞争
<14-4,CASTLE>Oh. But I will tell you, the women I competed against--

375
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,350
<14-5,MARTHA>-跟现在的一样激烈  -你的才艺是什么
<14-5,MARTHA>- Just as cutthroat as they are now. - What was your talent?

376
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
<14-7,MARTHA>我穿套头衫的方式
<14-7,MARTHA>The way I wore a sweater.

377
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,620
<14-8,MARTHA>-亲爱的  -阿丽克西斯
<14-8,MARTHA>- Hi, honey. - Hey, Alexis.

378
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,940
<14-9,CASTLE>怎么了
<14-9,CASTLE>What's wrong?

379
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,440
<14-10,ALEXIS>阿什利做了决定
<14-10,ALEXIS>Ashley made his decision.

380
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,850
<14-11,MARTHA>不妙
<14-11,MARTHA>Uh-oh.

381
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,240
<14-12,CASTLE>斯坦福吗
<14-12,CASTLE>Stanford?

382
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,110
<14-12,CASTLE>不是
<14-12,CASTLE>No.

383
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,080
<14-13,ALEXIS>他决定在纽约上大学
<14-13,ALEXIS>He decided to go to school here in New York.

384
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,840
<14-14,MARTHA>那有什么不好吗
<14-14,MARTHA>What's not good about that?

385
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,610
<14-15,ALEXIS>斯坦福是他的梦想
<14-15,ALEXIS>Stanford was his dream.

386
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,110
<14-15,ALEXIS>我不想成为他的绊脚石
<14-15,ALEXIS>I don't want to stand in the way of that.

387
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,640
<14-15,ALEXIS>他将来会恨我的
<14-15,ALEXIS>He'll just end up hating me for it.

388
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,460
<14-15,ALEXIS>这将是他人生最重要的决定
<14-15,ALEXIS>And this could be the most important decision of his life,

389
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,200
<14-15,ALEXIS>所以我也做了个决定
<14-15,ALEXIS>So I made a decision, too.

390
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,690
<14-16,ALEXIS>我跟他分手了
<14-16,ALEXIS>I broke up with him.

391
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,790
<14-17,MARTHA>宝贝
<14-17,MARTHA>Oh, baby.

392
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,560
<14-17,MARTHA>会没事的
<14-17,MARTHA>No, it's okay.

393
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,030
<15-1,BECKETT>她是对的
<15-1,BECKETT>well, she's right, you know?

394
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,250
<15-1,BECKETT>高中恋爱十有八九没结果
<15-1,BECKETT>I mean, odds are, it won't work out.

395
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,790
<15-2,CASTLE>-她只是很实际  -谈恋爱不是做数学题
<15-2,CASTLE>- She's just being practical. - Relationships aren't math problems.

396
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,120
<15-2,CASTLE>不能靠实际来解决问题
<15-2,CASTLE>You don't solve them by being practical.

397
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,710
<15-2,CASTLE>万一她遇到的是真爱呢
<15-2,CASTLE>I mean, what happens when she meets her soul mate,

398
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,470
<15-2,CASTLE>因为不够实际  就放弃努力争取吗
<15-2,CASTLE>but she doesn't risk it because it's not practical?

399
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,450
<15-3,ESPOSITO>夏威夷旅行怎么样  耳环呢
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Okay, then what about Hawaii? Earrings?

400
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,560
<15-3,ESPOSITO>内衣呢
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Ooh. Lingerie?

401
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,870
<15-4,CASTLE>肯定是给女人送礼物
<15-4,CASTLE>Things you buy a woman.

402
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,410
<15-4,CASTLE>猜猜游戏我最会了
<15-4,CASTLE>I used to kill on "Pyramid."

403
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,600
<15-5,MONTGOMERY>是我结婚30周年纪念
<15-5,MONTGOMERY>It's my 30th anniversary.

404
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,090
<15-6,BECKETT>恭喜  长官
<15-6,BECKETT>Oh, Sir, congratulations.

405
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,030
<15-7,CASTLE>结婚30年了  你还不知道该送她什么吗
<15-7,CASTLE>30 years of marriage, and you don't know what to buy her?

406
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,590
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>如果你结婚的时间足够长  就会知道
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>If you stayed married long enough, you'd know,

407
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,160
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>十年纪念日过去后就想不出什么新招了
<15-8,MONTGOMERY>it's hard to stay original after the first ten.

408
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,470
<15-10,BECKETT>-说的也是  -那你的婚姻成功秘诀是什么
<15-10,BECKETT>- That's fair. - So what's the secret to your success?

409
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,650
<15-11,MONTOMGERY>没什么秘诀  只是
<15-11,MONTOMGERY>There's no secret. Just...

410
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,600
<15-11,MONTOMGERY>经常见面
<15-11,MONTOMGERY>keep showing up.

411
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,110
<15-12,BECKETT>关于鲍比·斯塔克有什么收获吗
<15-12,BECKETT>Any luck on Bobby Stark?

412
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,480
<15-13,ESPOSITO>有  但你可能不会喜欢
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but you're not gonna like it.

413
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,740
<15-13,ESPOSITO>狗仔队拍到他进入翠贝卡大酒店时的照片
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Paparazzi snapped photos of him going into the Tribeca Grand Hotel

414
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,880
<15-13,ESPOSITO>时间是11点半  而且是和一个戴墨镜的褐发美人一起
<15-13,ESPOSITO>11:30 with a brunette wearing jackie o. glasses.

415
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,790
<15-13,ESPOSITO>凌晨1点  他离开了酒店  紧接着
<15-13,ESPOSITO>1:00 a.m., he left, at which point

416
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,820
<15-13,ESPOSITO>又到一个男士酒吧看摔跤
<15-13,ESPOSITO>he relocated to a gentlemen's club to watch mud wrestling.

417
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,230
<15-14,BECKETT>安波儿离开房间时是11点
<15-14,BECKETT>Amber left her room at 11:00.

418
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,670
<15-14,BECKETT>11点到11点半之间他在哪儿
<15-14,BECKETT>Where was he between 11:00 and 11:30?

419
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,040
<15-15,ESPOSITO>在去翠贝卡酒店的出租车上
<15-15,ESPOSITO>In a cab on his way to Tribeca.

420
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,060
<15-16,BECKETT>确定吗
<15-16,BECKETT>And we know this for a fact?

421
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,370
<15-17,ESPOSITO>是的  他一路都在微博上发自己扮酷的照片
<15-17,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he was tweeting photos of his manhood along the way.

422
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,130
<15-18,CASTLE>微博就要这样才有人气嘛
<15-18,CASTLE>And that's how you trend on twitter.

423
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,280
<15-19,BECKETT>那么安波儿身上那块亮片就是
<15-19,BECKETT>So the sequin must have broken off

424
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,310
<15-19,BECKETT>他碰到她时落下的
<15-19,BECKETT>onto Amber after he bumped up against her.

425
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,720
<15-19,BECKETT>-放他走  他不是凶手  -好的
<15-19,BECKETT>-Cut him loose. He's not our guy. - Right.

426
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,990
<15-21,BECKETT>-这意味着线索又断了  -我可不这么想
<15-21,BECKETT>- Which means we are dead in the water. - I wouldn't go that far.

427
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,270
<15-22,RYAN>她失窃的小提琴  我们找到了
<15-22,RYAN>Her stolen violin? We found it.

428
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,590
<15-24,RYAN>-在哪  -被丢在酒店后面的垃圾箱里
<15-24,RYAN>- Where? - Dumped in a garbage bin behind the hotel.

429
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,190
<15-25,CASTLE>被凶手处理了
<15-25,CASTLE>Disposed of by our killer,

430
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,490
<15-26,BECKETT>-但不是原先以为的那个凶手  -有指纹吗
<15-26,BECKETT>- just not the killer we thought. - Did we get prints?

431
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,320
<15-27,RYAN>是的  有安波儿·米德伯瑞的
<15-27,RYAN>Yeah, Amber Middleberry's

432
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,430
<15-27,RYAN>还有另一组指纹属于我们可爱的
<15-27,RYAN>and one other set belonging to the lovely,

433
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,860
<15-27,RYAN>才华横溢的
<15-27,RYAN>the talented...

434
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,270
<15-27,RYAN>来自佐治亚州的选手
<15-27,RYAN>contestant from Georgia.

435
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,450
<15-28,CASTLE>也就是...  噢
<15-28,CASTLE>Which one was... oh.

436
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,420
<16-1,JOY>安波儿跟我从"小闪星"选美赛起就是好朋友了
<16-1,JOY>Amber and I have been friends since Little Miss Spangles.

437
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,910
<16-1,JOY>你们怎么会认为是我杀了她
<16-1,JOY>Why would you think I killed her?

438
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,550
<16-2,BECKETT>因为小提琴盒上到处是你的指纹  乔伊
<16-2,BECKETT>Because your prints were all over the violin case, Joy.

439
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,730
<16-2,BECKETT>而昨天晚宴结束离开时  她还随身带着
<16-2,BECKETT>And she had it with her when she came back from dinner last night.

440
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,890
<16-3,JOY>她整理紧身衣时我帮她拿着的
<16-3,JOY>I held it for her while she fixed her tights.

441
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,600
<16-4,CASTLE>紧身衣也被扔在小提琴上呢
<16-4,CASTLE>They were on the violin, too.

442
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,550
<16-5,JOY>她本不可能进入半决赛的
<16-5,JOY>She wasn't even supposed to be a semifinalist,

443
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,450
<16-5,JOY>但她搞定了所有的问答题
<16-5,JOY>but then she nailed all her pageant questions.

444
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,940
<16-5,JOY>那本应是她的弱点
<16-5,JOY>It was supposed to be her weakness,

445
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,470
<16-5,JOY>但她让所有人都震撼了  她胜利在望
<16-5,JOY>but she blew everyone away. She was going to win.

446
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,060
<16-6,BECKETT>于是你杀了她之后  丢掉了她的小提琴
<16-6,BECKETT>So then you killed her and you dumped her violin.

447
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,980
<16-6,BECKETT>不  不是这样的
<16-6,BECKETT>No, that is not what happened.

448
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,860
<16-7,JOY>昨晚我们回酒店时
<16-7,JOY>Last night when we went back to the hotel,

449
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,330
<16-7,JOY>我看见她回到房间  放下东西后又出去了
<16-7,JOY>I saw her go into her room, drop off her stuff, and then leave again.

450
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,490
<16-7,JOY>但她走得很匆忙  房门没关好
<16-7,JOY>But she left so fast, her door didn't close all the way,

451
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,860
<16-7,JOY>于是我去替她关门  不经意看见了她的小提琴
<16-7,JOY>so I went to shut it, and that's when I saw her violin.

452
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,610
<16-7,JOY>她将它留在那里  像是在示威一样
<16-7,JOY>She just left it there. It was like a sign.

453
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,930
<16-7,JOY>我心想
<16-7,JOY>I thought...

454
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,210
<16-8,CASTLE>乔伊·琼斯  你有多想赢
<16-8,CASTLE>Joy Jones, how badly do you want this?

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,770
<16-8,CASTLE>你有多想赢
<16-8,CASTLE>How badly did you want it?

456
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,330
<16-9,JOY>不惜一切
<16-9,JOY>More than anything.

457
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,030
<16-9,JOY>我25岁了
<16-9,JOY>I'm 25.

458
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,780
<16-9,JOY>我快超龄了
<16-9,JOY>I'm old.

459
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,990
<16-9,JOY>这是我最后一年能参加比赛
<16-9,JOY>This is the last year I can qualify.

460
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,400
<16-9,JOY>我想要是我丢掉她的小提琴
<16-9,JOY>I thought if I took her violin,

461
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,030
<16-9,JOY>或许会让她大受打击
<16-9,JOY>it might throw her off enough

462
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,050
<16-9,JOY>在才艺决赛时我就能打败她了
<16-9,JOY>in the talent finals that I could beat her.

463
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,880
<16-10,CASTLE>但那还不够  是吧  你心想
<16-10,CASTLE>But that wasn't enough for you, was it? You thought,

464
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,090
<16-10,CASTLE>为何不将安波儿彻底踢出比赛呢
<16-10,CASTLE>why not just take Amber out of the contest completely?

465
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,540
<16-11,JOY>不  我只拿了她的小提琴
<16-11,JOY>No. All I did was take her violin,

466
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,500
<16-11,JOY>当我得知她死后  我慌了
<16-11,JOY>and when I found out she was dead, I panicked.

467
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,480
<16-11,JOY>我怕会被人发现  于是将它丢了
<16-11,JOY>I thought someone might find out, so I threw it away.

468
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,280
<16-12,BECKETT>演技不错  乔伊
<16-12,BECKETT>That is pretty good act, Joy.

469
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,730
<16-12,BECKETT>但法官是不会相信的
<16-12,BECKETT>But the judges just aren't buying it.

470
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,150
<16-13,JOY>不  我发誓
<16-13,JOY>No, I swear.

471
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,360
<16-13,JOY>我不需要杀了安波儿来将她踢出比赛
<16-13,JOY>I didn't have to kill Amber to get her out of the pageant.

472
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,060
<16-13,JOY>我在她的小提琴盒里发现了些东西
<16-13,JOY>I found something in her violin case,

473
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,750
<16-13,JOY>一些可怕的东西
<16-13,JOY>something awful.

474
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,420
<16-14,BECKETT>你发现了什么
<16-14,BECKETT>And what did you find?

475
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,410
<16-15,JOY>她遭杀害的原因
<16-15,JOY>The reason she was murdered.

476
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,340
<17-1,JOY>要是这传出去了  会毁了她的
<17-1,JOY>If these got out, it would've ruined her.

477
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,260
<17-1,JOY>她会被永远踢出这个圈子的
<17-1,JOY>She would've been kicked off the circuit for good.

478
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,790
<17-1,JOY>噢  我的天
<17-1,JOY>Oh, my god.

479
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,960
<17-2,CASTLE>-她完全...  -一丝不挂
<17-2,CASTLE>- She is absolutely, totally... - Naked.

480
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,840
<17-4,JOY>照片背后有条留言
<17-4,JOY>There's a note on the back of that one.

481
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,730
<17-5,BECKETT>"你知道代价是什么  不乖乖付钱  我就毁了你"
<17-5,BECKETT>"You know my price. Pay up or I will destroy you."

482
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,490
<17-5,BECKETT>她被勒索了
<17-5,BECKETT>So she was being blackmailed.

483
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,440
<17-6,CASTLE>看来某人将恐吓付诸实施了
<17-6,CASTLE>Looks like somebody made good on their threat.

484
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,280
<17-6,CASTLE>选美皇后们和裸照
<17-6,CASTLE>Beauty queens and naked pictures--

485
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,160
<18-1,CASTLE>就像美国的社交名流和性爱录像
<18-1,CASTLE>as american as socialites and sex tapes.

486
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,390
<18-2,BECKETT>安波儿渴望赢得这场选美比赛
<18-2,BECKETT>Amber dreamt of winning this pageant,

487
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,870
<18-2,BECKETT>她怎么会拍那样的照片
<18-2,BECKETT>why would she take those photos?

488
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,990
<18-2,BECKETT>我是说  她明白那样做有多冒险
<18-2,BECKETT>I mean, she knew the chance that she was taking.

489
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,370
<18-3,CASTLE>拥有智慧和美貌并不代表
<18-3,CASTLE>Well, just because you're smart and beautiful

490
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,860
<18-3,CASTLE>你有好的判断力
<18-3,CASTLE>doesn't mean you have good judgment.

491
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
<18-3,CASTLE>我不是在说自己
<18-3,CASTLE>I didn't mean me.

492
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,550
<18-4,ESPOSITO>刚跟安波儿的父亲联络完
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Just got off with Amber's father.

493
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,400
<18-4,ESPOSITO>对话很艰难
<18-4,ESPOSITO>That was a tough conversation.

494
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,040
<18-5,CASTLE>你是说  他不知道照片的事吗
<18-5,CASTLE>You mean, he didn't know about the photos?

495
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,170
<18-6,ESPOSITO>安波儿也没有告诉他关于勒索的事
<18-6,ESPOSITO>And Amber didn't tell him about the blackmailer either

496
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,760
<18-6,ESPOSITO>或者向他借钱
<18-6,ESPOSITO>or try to borrow money.

497
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,890
<18-7,BECKETT>或者她自己付清了
<18-7,BECKETT>Well, maybe she paid off the blackmailer on her own.

498
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,700
<18-8,ESPOSITO>不可能  安波儿的所有钱
<18-8,ESPOSITO>Not an option. Any money Amber did have

499
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,650
<18-8,ESPOSITO>都花在了鞋子  长袍和晒黑喷雾上
<18-8,ESPOSITO>went to paying for shoes, gowns, and spray tans.

500
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,570
<18-8,ESPOSITO>她的账户里只剩下50块钱
<18-8,ESPOSITO>She only had 50 bucks in the bank.

501
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,210
<18-8,ESPOSITO>而她最近也没有去提款
<18-8,ESPOSITO>And she didn't have any recent withdrawals either.

502
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,380
<18-9,CASTLE>贾斯汀说她心烦意乱  或者是因为
<18-9,CASTLE>Justin said that she was upset. Maybe that's because

503
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,930
<18-9,CASTLE>她没有足够的钱付给勒索者
<18-9,CASTLE>she didn't have the money to make it go away.

504
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,100
<18-10,BECKETT>那么为何要杀了她
<18-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but then why kill her?

505
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,920
<18-10,BECKETT>我是说  有脑子的勒索者
<18-10,BECKETT>I mean, a smart blackmailer

506
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,620
<18-10,BECKETT>都会给她点时间去筹钱
<18-10,BECKETT>would give her the time to get the cash.

507
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,250
<18-11,CASTLE>除非她威胁去报警
<18-11,CASTLE>Not if she threatened to go to the police,

508
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,980
<18-11,CASTLE>逼得他采取致命行动
<18-11,CASTLE>forcing him to take deadly action.

509
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,520
<18-11,CASTLE>致命行动  这标题不错
<18-11,CASTLE>Deadly action-- that's a good title.

510
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,440
<18-12,ESPOSITO>我重新查过了她的电话
<18-12,ESPOSITO>I rechecked her phone.

511
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,710
<18-12,ESPOSITO>没有任何奇怪的通话记录
<18-12,ESPOSITO>There's no record of any unusual calls.

512
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,060
<18-12,ESPOSITO>我想勒索者是通过酒店的电话联络她
<18-12,ESPOSITO>I figure the blackmailer contacted her through her hotel phone,

513
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,130
<18-12,ESPOSITO>那样就反查不到他身上了
<18-12,ESPOSITO>that way he couldn't be traced.

514
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,410
<18-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看过这些照片了吗
<18-13,BECKETT>Castle, have you taken a look at these photos?

515
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,600
<18-14,CASTLE>只看了跟调查有关的部分
<18-14,CASTLE>Only in so far as it pertains to the investigation.

516
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,160
<18-15,BECKETT>看看这打光和构图
<18-15,BECKETT>Look at the lighting and the composition.

517
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,100
<18-15,BECKETT>拍照的人很懂摄影技术
<18-15,BECKETT>Whoever took these knew something about photography.

518
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,620
<18-17,BECKETT>-一个专业摄影师  -这事经常发生
<18-17,BECKETT>- A professional. - I mean, it happens all the time.

519
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,320
<18-17,BECKETT>模特和专业摄影师拍照  拍完后
<18-17,BECKETT>Girl gets a session with a pro, they finish, he offers

520
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,310
<18-17,BECKETT>摄影师提出拍一些艺术照  模特急于用钱
<18-17,BECKETT>to take a few art shots, she's desperate for the cash,

521
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,020
<18-17,BECKETT>摄影师承诺照片永远不会曝光
<18-17,BECKETT>he promises he'll never show it to anybody...

522
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,310
<18-18,CASTLE>某一天模特成名了  这时候
<18-18,CASTLE>Until she makes it big, in which case,

523
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,390
<18-18,CASTLE>-照片突然出现了  -埃斯波西托
<18-18,CASTLE>- they suddenly surface. - Esposito,

524
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,560
<18-19,BECKETT>找选美顾问问话
<18-19,BECKETT>let's get ahold of the pageant consultant.

525
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,400
<18-19,BECKETT>还有将和安波儿合作过的
<18-19,BECKETT>Let's get a list of all the photographers

526
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,650
<18-19,BECKETT>摄影师全都列出来
<18-19,BECKETT>that Amber's had sessions with.

527
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,830
<18-19,BECKETT>-其中一人可能就是勒索者  -好的
<18-19,BECKETT>- One of them might be our blackmailer. - All right.

528
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,990
<19-1,JUSTIN>这或许就是她心烦的原因
<19-1,JUSTIN>This must have been what she was so upset about.

529
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,660
<19-1,JUSTIN>她清楚如果选美大会发现了
<19-1,JUSTIN>She knew, if the pageant found out,

530
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,240
<19-1,JUSTIN>一切就都完了
<19-1,JUSTIN>it would've all been over.

531
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,130
<19-1,JUSTIN>全完了  但她为什么不告诉我
<19-1,JUSTIN>It is all over. But why didn't she just tell me?

532
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,810
<19-2,ESPOSITO>你有头绪这些照片是谁拍的吗
<19-2,ESPOSITO>Do you have any idea who might have taken these photographs?

533
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,680
<19-3,JUSTIN>看这发型  应该是六个月前了
<19-3,JUSTIN>With that hairstyle, it must have been six months ago.

534
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,440
<19-3,JUSTIN>我要查一下我的行程表
<19-3,JUSTIN>I'll have to check my calendar.

535
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,080
<19-3,JUSTIN>警员们问过了
<19-3,JUSTIN>So uniforms talked

536
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,600
<19-3,JUSTIN>跟安波儿亲近的选美参赛者
<19-3,JUSTIN>to the pageant girls that Amber was closest to.

537
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,300
<20-1,BECKETT>她没有跟任何人说照片的事
<20-1,BECKETT>She didn't tell them about the photos either.

538
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,950
<20-2,CASTLE>她大概认为这事会被别人利用  反咬她一口
<20-2,CASTLE>Well, she probably thought they'd use it against her.

539
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,420
<20-3,MONTGOMERY>贝克特  你是女人  对吧
<20-3,MONTGOMERY>Beckett, you're a woman, right?

540
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,660
<20-4,BECKETT>长官  我不知道该送什么礼物给你老婆
<20-4,BECKETT>Sir, I have no idea what to get your wife.

541
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,840
<20-5,CASTLE>还没想好要送什么吗
<20-5,CASTLE>Still no luck on the gift?

542
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,170
<20-6,MONTGOMERY>想破头也没头绪
<20-6,MONTGOMERY>Keep coming up empty.

543
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,720
<20-7,CASTLE>给女人最好的礼物
<20-7,CASTLE>The best thing to give a woman

544
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,250
<20-7,CASTLE>就是她不经意说出口想要
<20-7,CASTLE>is something she said she wanted

545
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,500
<20-7,CASTLE>却又觉得你根本不会放心上的东西
<20-7,CASTLE>When she didn't think you were listening.

546
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,390
<20-8,MONTGOMERY>要是我真的没放心上呢
<20-8,MONTGOMERY>What if I wasn't listening?

547
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,980
<20-9,CASTLE>礼卷怎么样
<20-9,CASTLE>Gift certificate?

549
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,840
<21-1,ESPOSITO>根据她的选美顾问说
<21-1,ESPOSITO>So according to her pageant consultant,

550
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,470
<21-1,ESPOSITO>安波儿六个月前进城拍过照
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Amber was in the city about six months ago for a photo shoot.

551
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,250
<21-1,ESPOSITO>他认为跟那些照片的拍摄时间相近
<21-1,ESPOSITO>He thinks they were taken around the same time.

552
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,570
<21-2,BECKETT>谁是摄影师
<21-2,BECKETT>And who was the shoot with?

553
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,560
<21-3,ESPOSITO>一个叫戴克斯·拉蒂莫的摄影师
<21-3,ESPOSITO>A photographer named Dax Lattimer.

554
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,460
<21-4,BECKETT>他有前科吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Does he have a record?

555
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,990
<21-5,ESPOSITO>没有  但我打听过了
<21-5,ESPOSITO>Negative, but I asked around,

556
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,530
<21-5,ESPOSITO>这家伙是拍裸照的老手了
<21-5,ESPOSITO>and the guy's no stranger to dirty pictures.

557
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,500
<21-5,ESPOSITO>除了拍摄肖像照
<21-5,ESPOSITO>On top of headshots,

558
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,480
<21-5,ESPOSITO>他还兼职为成人杂志拍照
<21-5,ESPOSITO>he also freelances for adult magazines.

559
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,220
<21-6,BECKETT>看上去像是我们要找的人  他现在在哪
<21-6,BECKETT>Well, sounds like our guy. Where is he now?

560
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,440
<21-7,ESPOSITO>他在曼哈顿东村区的工作室
<21-7,ESPOSITO>He's at a studio in the East Village.

561
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,660
<21-8,BECKETT>-我现在就过去  -好的  我让莱恩跟你碰头
<21-8,BECKETT>- I'm heading there now. - Okay. I'll have ryan meet you.

562
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,180
<22-1,LATTIMER>当然  我记得安波儿  是个甜心
<22-1,LATTIMER>Sure, I remember Amber. Very sweet gal.

563
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,010
<22-1,LATTIMER>我为她拍了些肖像照
<22-1,LATTIMER>I took some headshots for her.

564
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,870
<22-2,ESPOSITO>你当时还拍了其他照片吗
<22-2,ESPOSITO>You take anything else while you were at it?

565
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,200
<22-2,ESPOSITO>比如她的裸照呢
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe some snaps of her wearing nothing but a smile?

566
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
<22-3,LATTIMER>安波儿不是那类的女孩  她光彩照人
<22-3,LATTIMER>Amber wasn't the type. She was all about the glamour.

567
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,460
<22-3,LATTIMER>到底怎么回事
<22-3,LATTIMER>So what's this about?

568
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,890
<22-4,RYAN>她被谋杀了
<22-4,RYAN>she was murdered.

569
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,600
<22-5,ESPOSITO>我们认为凶手
<22-5,ESPOSITO>And we think whoever killed her

570
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,250
<22-5,ESPOSITO>就是拍这张照片的人
<22-5,ESPOSITO>took this picture right here.

571
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,090
<22-6,LATTIMER>不是我拍的  我没有那么平庸
<22-6,LATTIMER>Yeah, well, I didn't take this. I'm not that mediocre.

572
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,030
<22-7,ESPOSITO>真的吗  这些照片是在
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Really? These were shot around

573
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,280
<22-8,RYAN>你跟安波儿合作时期照的
<22-8,RYAN>the time you worked with Amber.

574
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,600
<22-8,RYAN>而且我们都知道你不止拍宠物和全家福
<22-8,RYAN>And we all know you do more than just pets and families.

575
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,140
<22-9,LATTIMER>嘿  混口饭吃都不容易
<22-9,LATTIMER>Hey, we all have to pay the bills.

576
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,120
<22-10,ESPOSITO>而安波儿作为冉冉升起的新星
<22-10,ESPOSITO>And with Amber's star on the rise,

577
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,860
<22-10,ESPOSITO>这张照片定然价值不菲
<22-10,ESPOSITO>that photo's worth some serious coin.

578
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,290
<22-11,RYAN>像她那样漂亮的女孩
<22-11,RYAN>Pretty girl like that,

579
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,910
<22-11,RYAN>跟你独处一室
<22-11,RYAN>alone here with you in the studio?

580
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,200
<22-12,LATTIMER>你要相信我  这张照片不是我拍的
<22-12,LATTIMER>Hey, you have to believe me. I didn't take this photograph.

581
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,800
<22-12,LATTIMER>再说了  我们不是孤男寡女
<22-12,LATTIMER>Besides, we weren't alone.

582
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,550
<22-13,RYAN>她和其他人一起
<22-13,RYAN>She was with someone.

583
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,960
<22-14,LATTIMER>-谁  -貌似是男朋友
<22-14,LATTIMER>- Who? - Some boyfriend.

584
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,990
<22-14,LATTIMER>那家伙是个怪胎
<22-14,LATTIMER>The guy was a real creep, too.

585
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,050
<22-15,ESPOSITO>安波儿没有男朋友
<22-15,ESPOSITO>Amber didn't have a boyfriend.

586
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,440
<22-16,LATTIMER>她在这里的时候有
<22-16,LATTIMER>Well, she did when she was here.

587
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,350
<22-16,LATTIMER>实际上  他还把自己幻想成摄影师
<22-16,LATTIMER>In fact, he fancied himself a photographer,

588
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,020
<22-16,LATTIMER>一直告诉我要在自然光下对她进行拍摄
<22-16,LATTIMER>kept telling me I should shoot Amber in natural light.

589
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,610
<22-17,ESPOSITO>这个男朋友叫什么
<22-17,ESPOSITO>This boyfriend have a name?

590
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,330
<22-18,LATTIMER>杰瑞  杰瑞米什么的
<22-18,LATTIMER>Jerry. Jeremy. Something like that.

591
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,470
<22-19,RYAN>拉蒂莫先生  昨天晚上十一点
<22-19,RYAN>Mr. Lattimer, where were you night before last

592
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,040
<22-19,RYAN>到凌晨一点这期间你在哪里
<22-19,RYAN>between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.?

593
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,610
<22-20,LATTIMER>在家和我老婆在一起
<22-20,LATTIMER>At home with my wife,

594
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,040
<22-20,LATTIMER>哄我得了疝气的儿子睡觉
<22-20,LATTIMER>trying to rock my colicky son to sleep.

595
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,720
<22-20,LATTIMER>楼里面有门卫  你们可以去核实
<22-20,LATTIMER>It's a doorman building, so you can check.

596
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,220
<23-1,BECKETT>好的  多谢
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

597
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,380
<23-1,BECKETT>安波儿的爸爸说她曾经有个男朋友
<23-1,BECKETT>Amber's dad said that she used to have a boyfriend--

598
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,320
<23-1,BECKETT>名叫杰瑞米·凯佩尔
<23-1,BECKETT>Jeremy Keiper.

599
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,910
<23-2,RYAN>凯佩尔  他是不是怪里怪气的
<23-2,RYAN>Keiper? Was he creepy?

600
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,910
<23-3,BECKETT>是的  她爸爸是这么认为的
<23-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, her dad thought so.

601
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,980
<23-3,BECKETT>据他所知  他们去年年底分手了
<23-3,BECKETT>As far as he knows, they broke up late last year

602
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,790
<23-3,BECKETT>因为她意识到他在拖她的后腿
<23-3,BECKETT>because she realized that he was holding her back.

603
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,700
<23-3,BECKETT>爸爸觉得男朋友还在伊利诺斯州
<23-3,BECKETT>The dad thinks that the boyfriend's still in Illinois.

604
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,620
<23-4,CASTLE>这就是敲诈的绝妙之处
<23-4,CASTLE>Well, that's the beauty of blackmail--

605
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,700
<23-4,CASTLE>它不受地点的限制
<23-4,CASTLE>You can do it from anywhere.

606
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,330
<23-5,BECKETT>敲诈  或许是  但谋杀  绝对不是
<23-5,BECKETT>Blackmail, maybe. But not murder.

607
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,540
<23-5,BECKETT>我们何不去查查凯佩尔最近是否拜访过她
<23-5,BECKETT>Why don't we find out if Keiper paid her a visit lately?

608
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,610
<23-6,RYAN>马上去办
<23-6,RYAN>On it.

609
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,040
<23-7,BECKETT>蹩脚男友配选美皇后
<23-7,BECKETT>Bad boyfriends and pageant queens?

610
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,550
<23-7,BECKETT>这简直是黛比·文妮科故事的翻版
<23-7,BECKETT>This is like Debbie Winokur all over again.

611
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,800
<23-8,CASTLE>你又忆起往昔了
<23-8,CASTLE>You having flashbacks?

612
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,590
<23-9,BECKETT>那简直就是我独自一人深陷越南
<23-9,BECKETT>It was my own private Vietnam.

613
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,790
<23-9,BECKETT>我们家里闻起来都是发胶
<23-9,BECKETT>Our place smelled of hair spray,

614
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,560
<23-9,BECKETT>香水和香烟的味道
<23-9,BECKETT>perfume, and cigarettes.

615
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,810
<23-9,BECKETT>我都惊讶于我们怎么没把自己烧着
<23-9,BECKETT>I'm surprised that we didn't spontaneously combust.

616
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,000
<23-10,CASTLE>我爱死早上发胶的味道了
<23-10,CASTLE>I love the smell of hair spray in the morning.

617
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
<23-10,CASTLE>闻起来像是
<23-10,CASTLE>It smells like...

618
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,130
<23-10,CASTLE>胜利
<23-10,CASTLE>victory.

619
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,740
<23-11,ASHLEY>打扰一下  卡塞尔先生
<23-11,ASHLEY>Excuse me, Mr. Castle?

620
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,200
<23-12,CASTLE>阿什利
<23-12,CASTLE>Ashley.

621
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,640
<24-1,ASHLEY>我很抱歉在您工作的时候打扰您
<24-1,ASHLEY>I'm sorry to bug you at work,

622
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,370
<24-1,ASHLEY>但是阿里克西斯定了个不打电话不联系的政策
<24-1,ASHLEY>but Alexis established a-a no calls, no contact policy.

623
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,170
<24-2,CASTLE>她告诉我了
<24-2,CASTLE>She told me.

624
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,160
<24-3,ASHLEY>我犯了个大错
<24-3,ASHLEY>Look, I-I made a big mistake.

625
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,490
<24-3,ASHLEY>我觉得如果我选择了斯坦福
<24-3,ASHLEY>I thought if I chose Stanford,

626
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,890
<24-3,ASHLEY>阿里克西斯就会觉得我把她甩掉了
<24-3,ASHLEY>Alexis would think that I was blowing her off.

627
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,770
<24-3,ASHLEY>但是相反  她生气是因为我选择了她
<24-3,ASHLEY>Instead, she's mad at me because I chose her

628
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,330
<24-3,ASHLEY>而不是我想要去的学校
<24-3,ASHLEY>over where I want to go to school.

629
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,070
<24-3,ASHLEY>现在我要去斯坦福了
<24-3,ASHLEY>So now I'm going to Stanford,

630
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,000
<24-3,ASHLEY>那是我最想去的学校  但是
<24-3,ASHLEY>which is where I wanted to go in the first place, but--

631
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,570
<24-4,CASTLE>但如果你打电话告诉她
<24-4,CASTLE>But if you call her and tell her that,

632
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,530
<24-4,CASTLE>她就会对你更生气
<24-4,CASTLE>she'll be even angrier with you

633
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,030
<24-4,CASTLE>因为你忽略了她的界限
<24-4,CASTLE>for ignoring her boundaries.

634
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,590
<24-5,ASHLEY>完全正确  我觉得阿里克西斯和我
<24-5,ASHLEY>Exactly. Look, I think alexis and I

635
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,130
<24-5,ASHLEY>能够让这段异地恋走下去
<24-5,ASHLEY>can make the whole long-distance thing work.

636
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,030
<24-5,ASHLEY>我真的这么觉得  您能转告她吗
<24-5,ASHLEY>I really do. Would you tell her that?

637
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,690
<24-5,ASHLEY>您能帮我和她谈谈吗
<24-5,ASHLEY>Would you talk to her for me?

638
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,070
<24-6,CASTLE>阿什利  我很感激
<24-6,CASTLE>Ashley, I-I appreciate,

639
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,320
<24-6,CASTLE>今天你能找我来谈话
<24-6,CASTLE>it was probably very hard for you to come down

640
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,440
<24-6,CASTLE>对你来说一定很难
<24-6,CASTLE>and talk to me today,

641
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,570
<24-6,CASTLE>但是我觉得由我来不太合适...
<24-6,CASTLE>but I just don't think it's very appropriate for me to get--

642
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,950
<24-6,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生
<24-6,CASTLE>Mr. Castle,

643
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,060
<24-7,ASHLEY>您有没有对一个执意推开您的人
<24-7,ASHLEY>have you ever been crazy about someone

644
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,310
<24-7,ASHLEY>痴心不改
<24-7,ASHLEY>who was determined to push you away?

645
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,200
<24-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  哦  对不起
<24-8,BECKETT>Hey, Castle, uh-- oh, sorry, guys.

646
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,120
<24-8,BECKETT>不...
<24-8,BECKETT>No, it...

647
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,890
<24-9,CASTLE>没事
<24-9,CASTLE>It's o--um...

648
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,030
<24-9,CASTLE>阿什利  我很抱歉  我得走了
<24-9,CASTLE>Ashley, I'm--I'm sorry. I do have to go.

649
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,360
<24-10,ASHLEY>请您考虑一下  好吗
<24-10,ASHLEY>Please just, um, think about it, okay?

650
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,310
<24-11,CASTLE>好的
<24-11,CASTLE>Okay.

651
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,890
<24-12,BECKETT>找你干什么
<24-12,BECKETT>What's that about?

652
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,590
<24-13,CASTLE>他想让我帮他求情
<24-13,CASTLE>He wants me to advocate for him.

653
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,150
<24-14,BECKETT>真可爱
<24-14,BECKETT>Oh. That's sweet.

654
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,270
<24-16,BECKETT>-是啊  -还很尴尬
<24-16,BECKETT>- Yeah. - And awkward.

655
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,780
<24-17,CASTLE>尴尬多过可爱
<24-17,CASTLE>Mostly awkward.

656
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,280
<24-18,RYAN>贝克特  我刚和杰瑞米·凯佩尔的妈妈通了电话
<24-18,RYAN>Yo, Beckett! I just got off the phone with Jeremy Keiper's mom.

657
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,040
<24-18,RYAN>发现上个月杰瑞米就搬到了纽约
<24-18,RYAN>Turns out Jeremy moved to New York last month,

658
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,250
<24-18,RYAN>说他要"改头换面"
<24-18,RYAN>said he was going to "make something of himself."

659
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,070
<24-19,CASTLE>看起来他把自己改成了敲诈者和杀人犯
<24-19,CASTLE>Looks like he made himself into a blackmailer and a killer.

660
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,970
<25-1,BECKETT>杰瑞米·凯佩尔  纽约警局  开门
<25-1,BECKETT>Jeremy Keiper, NYPD. Open up.

661
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,170
<25-2,BECKETT>凯佩尔先生
<25-2,BECKETT>Mr. Keiper?

662
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,500
<25-2,BECKETT>有人吗
<25-2,BECKETT>Anybody here?

664
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,070
<25-2,BECKETT>看起来有人对旧情难以放手啊
<25-2,BECKETT>Looks like someone had a hard time letting go.

665
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,640
<25-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<25-2,BECKETT>Castle.

666
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,700
<26-1,CASTLE>就简直就是个经典的谋杀后自杀
<26-1,CASTLE>This is a classic murder-suicide.

667
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,230
<26-1,CASTLE>杰瑞米敲诈他的前女友
<26-1,CASTLE>Jeremy blackmails his ex-girlfriend,

668
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,140
<26-1,CASTLE>并不是因为他需要钱
<26-1,CASTLE>not because he needs the money,

669
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,030
<26-1,CASTLE>而是因为他对她念念不忘
<26-1,CASTLE>but because clearly, he's obsessed with her.

670
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,310
<26-1,CASTLE>安波儿拒绝了他和他的勒索
<26-1,CASTLE>Amber rejects him and his scheme-y schemes.

671
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,410
<26-1,CASTLE>他就发疯崩溃  把她杀了  之后
<26-1,CASTLE>He flips, he snaps, he kills her, and then,

672
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,040
<26-1,CASTLE>面对自己的所作所为  把自己吊死了
<26-1,CASTLE>faced with the reality of what he's done, hangs himself.

673
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,000
<26-2,PERLMUTTER>你的理论有一个漏洞  卡塞尔
<26-2,PERLMUTTER>Only one problem with your theory, Castle.

674
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,640
<26-3,CASTLE>-是什么  -这不是自杀
<26-3,CASTLE>- Which is? - This wasn't a suicide.

675
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,240
<26-5,BECKETT>不是吗
<26-5,BECKETT>This wasn't?

676
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,360
<26-6,PERLMUTTER>如果他是自行上吊
<26-6,PERLMUTTER>If he'd hanged himself,

677
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,530
<26-6,PERLMUTTER>他脖子上的勒痕角度应向上
<26-6,PERLMUTTER>the marks on his neck would angle upwards.

678
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,020
<26-7,CASTLE>是啊  就是向上的
<26-7,CASTLE>Yes, which they do.

679
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,920
<26-8,PERLMUTTER>是啊  但如果他是被人勒死的
<26-8,PERLMUTTER>Yes, but if he was strangled,

680
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,290
<26-8,PERLMUTTER>勒痕应该是水平的  两种痕迹均出现在脖子上
<26-8,PERLMUTTER>the marks would go straight across. This guy's got both.

681
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,770
<26-9,BECKETT>把他吊起来只是为了掩饰他是被人勒死的
<26-9,BECKETT>Then the hanging was a cover up for the strangulation.

682
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,240
<26-10,PERLMUTTER>而且在手臂和肋骨周围有死前瘀伤
<26-10,PERLMUTTER>Well, there's also peri-mortem bruising on the arms and across the ribs.

683
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,850
<26-10,PERLMUTTER>我想死前一定有挣扎
<26-10,PERLMUTTER>I'm guessing there was a struggle.

684
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:38,880
<26-11,BECKETT>估算的死亡时间
<26-11,BECKETT>Estimated time of death?

685
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,030
<26-12,PERLMUTTER>从尸温和尸斑判断
<26-12,PERLMUTTER>Well, judging by temperature and lividity,

686
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,860
<26-12,PERLMUTTER>他早于安波儿·米德伯瑞半天遇害
<26-12,PERLMUTTER>He was killed half a day before Amber Middleberry.

687
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,620
<26-13,CASTLE>早于安波儿
<26-13,CASTLE>Before Amber?

688
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,770
<26-14,PERLMUTTER>是的  早
<26-14,PERLMUTTER>Yes, before!

689
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,750
<26-14,PERLMUTTER>现在你能动动吗  你挡住我的光了
<26-14,PERLMUTTER>Now can you please move? You're in my light.

690
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,260
<26-15,CASTLE>这完全没道理啊   如果他没有杀安波儿
<26-15,CASTLE>This doesn't make any sense. If he didn't kill Amber...

691
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,620
<26-15,CASTLE>勒索者和被勒索的人怎么都死翘翘了
<26-15,CASTLE>How do a blackmailer and his victim both end up dead?

692
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,370
<26-16,ESPOSITO>看看这个
<26-16,ESPOSITO>Yo, check this out.

693
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,630
<26-16,ESPOSITO>他的硬盘内容被消除了
<26-16,ESPOSITO>His hard drive's been wiped.

694
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,470
<26-17,BECKETT>这就是我们的联系  卡塞尔
<26-17,BECKETT>That's our connection, Castle.

695
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,980
<26-17,BECKETT>安波儿和杰瑞米的相同之处就是
<26-17,BECKETT>It's the one thing that Amber and Jeremy had in common--

696
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,460
<26-17,BECKETT>那些照片
<26-17,BECKETT>those photos.

697
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,520
<26-17,BECKETT>有人不想让它们曝光
<26-17,BECKETT>Someone didn't want them to see the light of day.

698
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,410
<27-1,BECKETT>安波儿的爸爸根本就不知道有这事
<27-1,BECKETT>Amber's dad had no idea this was going on with his daughter.

699
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,110
<27-1,BECKETT>在过去的半年里她都没有提过
<27-1,BECKETT>She didn't even mention Jeremy's name

700
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,280
<27-1,BECKETT>杰瑞米的名字
<27-1,BECKETT>in the last six months.

701
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,470
<27-2,CASTLE>在他们在一起的时候
<27-2,CASTLE>Is there anything else that Jeremy and Amber

702
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,100
<27-2,CASTLE>没有卷入到其他事情里面吗
<27-2,CASTLE>could've been involved with while they were together?

703
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,350
<27-3,BECKETT>没有  他是没想起来什么
<27-3,BECKETT>No, not that he can recall.

704
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,600
<27-4,CASTLE>这些照片  以当今的标准来看
<27-4,CASTLE>These pictures, by today's standards,

705
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,430
<27-4,CASTLE>可以说是很有品位
<27-4,CASTLE>are--are downright tasteful.

706
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,670
<27-4,CASTLE>这种照片怎么会导致人被害呢
<27-4,CASTLE>How do these get you killed?

707
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,000
<27-5,BECKETT>可能与艳照无关
<27-5,BECKETT>It can't be about naked pictures.

708
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,010
<27-5,BECKETT>-一定是发生了其他事情  -除非
<27-5,BECKETT>- Something else must have been going on. - Unless...

709
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,320
<27-7,BECKETT>-除非什么  -除非杰瑞米不是唯一的勒索者
<27-7,BECKETT>- Unless what? - Unless Jeremy wasn't the only blackmailer.

710
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,920
<27-8,CASTLE>如果他有个同伙呢  我是说
<27-8,CASTLE>What if he had a partner? I mean,

711
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,620
<27-8,CASTLE>我们知道安波儿在被害当晚与人发生了争吵
<27-8,CASTLE>we know Amber was arguing with someone the night she was killed.

712
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,640
<27-8,CASTLE>我们也知道这个人不可能是杰瑞米
<27-8,CASTLE>We know it couldn't have been Jeremy,

713
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,780
<27-8,CASTLE>因为他已经死了
<27-8,CASTLE>because he was already dead.

714
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,700
<27-9,BECKETT>为什么杰瑞米的同伙把他杀了呢
<27-9,BECKETT>Why would the partner kill Jeremy?

715
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,010
<27-10,CASTLE>也许他们闹翻了
<27-10,CASTLE>Maybe they had a falling out.

716
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,520
<27-10,CASTLE>也许杰瑞米决定他不能伤害安波儿
<27-10,CASTLE>Maybe Jeremy decided he couldn't hurt amber,

717
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,140
<27-10,CASTLE>但是同伙还是想要他的钱
<27-10,CASTLE>but the partner still wanted his payday.

718
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,160
<27-11,BECKETT>所以他就杀掉杰瑞米决定自己去找安波儿
<27-11,BECKETT>So he takes out Jeremy and decides to go after Amber himself?

719
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,830
<27-12,CASTLE>但安波儿说他是在虚张声势
<27-12,CASTLE>But Amber decides to call his bluff.

720
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,280
<27-12,CASTLE>她说她会联系警方
<27-12,CASTLE>She says she's gonna contact the police.

721
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,050
<27-12,CASTLE>于是勒索者就别无选择  他只能杀掉她
<27-12,CASTLE>Now the blackmailer has no choice. He has to kill her

722
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,170
<27-12,CASTLE>然后销毁所有勒索的证据
<27-12,CASTLE>and get rid of all the evidence of blackmail.

723
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,710
<27-12,CASTLE>莱恩
<27-12,CASTLE>Ryan.

724
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,230
<27-13,BECKETT>把所有关于杰瑞米·凯佩尔的资料都给我
<27-13,BECKETT>Give me everything you got on Jeremy Keiper.

725
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,180
<27-14,RYAN>对不起  宝贝
<27-14,RYAN>I'm sorry, baby.

726
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,700
<28-2,ALEXIS>很晚了  这里就交给你了
<28-2,ALEXIS>Whoa. It's late. I'll leave you to it.

727
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,360
<28-3,CASTLE>看什么呢
<28-3,CASTLE>Whatcha looking at?

728
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,490
<28-4,CASTLE>你真的很想他  是不是
<28-4,CASTLE>You really miss him, don't ya?

729
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,960
<28-5,CASTLE>你知道  我不喜欢去干预
<28-5,CASTLE>You know I-I hate to interfere--

730
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,550
<28-6,ALEXIS>从什么时候开始的
<28-6,ALEXIS>Since when?

731
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,260
<28-7,CASTLE>有道理
<28-7,CASTLE>Point taken.

732
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,150
<28-7,CASTLE>阿什利今天来分局找我了
<28-7,CASTLE>Ashley dropped by the precinct to see me today.

733
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,940
<28-8,ALEXIS>是吗  为什么
<28-8,ALEXIS>He did? Why?

734
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,590
<28-9,CASTLE>他想让我帮他说情
<28-9,CASTLE>He wanted me to intercede on his behalf.

735
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,450
<28-10,ALEXIS>他说了什么
<28-10,ALEXIS>What'd he say?

736
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,630
<28-11,CASTLE>他看起来比你快乐不到哪去
<28-11,CASTLE>Well, he looked about as happy as you do,

737
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,370
<28-11,CASTLE>他想让我告诉你
<28-11,CASTLE>and he wanted me to tell you

738
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,340
<28-11,CASTLE>他决定去斯坦福
<28-11,CASTLE>that he has decided to go to Stanford.

739
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,650
<28-12,ALEXIS>还有
<28-12,ALEXIS>And...

740
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,540
<28-13,CASTLE>他想要给长距离恋爱一次机会
<28-13,CASTLE>he wants to give a long-distance relationship a shot.

741
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,270
<28-13,CASTLE>他认为这能成功
<28-13,CASTLE>He thinks it could work.

742
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,260
<28-14,ALEXIS>你怎么想的
<28-14,ALEXIS>What do you think?

743
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,170
<28-15,CASTLE>我认为没有绝对的事情
<28-15,CASTLE>I think that nothing is certain.

744
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,710
<28-15,CASTLE>还有你可能在放弃一件
<28-15,CASTLE>And you could be ending something

745
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,560
<28-15,CASTLE>如果你再给点时间
<28-15,CASTLE>that might have worked if you had just...

746
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,790
<28-15,CASTLE>说不定会成功的事情
<28-15,CASTLE>given it a little more time.

747
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,420
<28-16,ALEXIS>如果我只是在避免
<28-16,ALEXIS>What if I'm just cutting my losses on

748
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,400
<28-16,ALEXIS>一件注定会失败的事情呢
<28-16,ALEXIS>something that was never meant to be?

749
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,340
<28-16,ALEXIS>那么  我们可以成为
<28-16,ALEXIS>Well, then we can be the father-daughter version of

750
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,960
<28-17,CASTLE>父女版的《灰色花园》
<28-17,CASTLE>"Grey Gardens."

751
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
<28-17,CASTLE>人生就像一段旅程
<28-17,CASTLE>Life is a journey,

752
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,910
<28-17,CASTLE>我们无法预测要发生的事
<28-17,CASTLE>and there is no predicting the outcome.

753
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,810
<28-17,CASTLE>你唯一能掌握的就是你的选择  而...
<28-17,CASTLE>The only thing you can control are your choices, and they'll...

754
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:49,460
<28-17,CASTLE>这些选择会决定你的成长你的未来
<28-17,CASTLE>They'll define who you are.

755
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,240
<28-17,CASTLE>我只是不想看到你
<28-17,CASTLE>I would just hate to see you

756
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,810
<28-17,CASTLE>专注于眼前的问题
<28-17,CASTLE>so focused on the problem right in front of you

757
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,990
<28-17,CASTLE>致使你...错过充满可能性的一切
<28-17,CASTLE>that you... completely miss the entire picture.

758
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,220
<28-18,ALEXIS>真是不错的建议
<28-18,ALEXIS>That's pretty good advice.

759
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,350
<28-19,CASTLE>是啊  真是不错  是吧
<28-19,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, actually it is, isn't it?

760
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,360
<28-19,CASTLE>是啊
<28-19,CASTLE>Yeah.

761
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,520
<29-1,BECKETT>记得提醒我圣诞节帮你订一刊女性杂志
<29-1,BECKETT>Remind me to get you a subscription to a girlie magazine for Christmas.

762
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,660
<29-2,CASTLE>你考虑的真周到
<29-2,CASTLE>Oh, that is so thoughtful,

763
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,530
<29-2,CASTLE>但我不是在看裸女
<29-2,CASTLE>but I'm not looking at the naked girl.

764
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,600
<29-3,BECKETT>那你在看什么
<29-3,BECKETT>What are you looking at?

765
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
<29-2,CASTLE>除了裸女之外的一切
<29-2,CASTLE>Everything but the naked girl.

766
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,390
<29-4,CASTLE>我们把注意力都放在安波儿身上
<29-4,CASTLE>We were so focused on Amber,

767
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,120
<29-4,CASTLE>我们差点忘记了其他的一切
<29-4,CASTLE>we almost missed the entire picture.

768
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,580
<29-4,CASTLE>如果安波儿和杰瑞米被杀不是因为
<29-4,CASTLE>What if Amber and Jeremy were killed not because of

769
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,130
<29-4,CASTLE>照片中的人  而是因为拍照的地点呢
<29-4,CASTLE>who was in this photo, but because of where the photo was taken?

770
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,790
<29-4,CASTLE>看上去眼熟吗
<29-4,CASTLE>Anything look familiar?

771
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,690
<29-5,BECKETT>当然
<29-5,BECKETT>Sure does.

772
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,790
<29-6,CASTLE>你可以等会儿再谢我
<29-6,CASTLE>You can thank me later.

773
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,010
<30-1,BECKETT>说到杀人动机
<30-1,BECKETT>Talk about a motive for murder.

774
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,630
<30-1,BECKETT>如果这些照片被登上小报
<30-1,BECKETT>If these photos got out to the tabloids...

775
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,480
<30-2,CASTLE>肯定会毁了一切的
<30-2,CASTLE>It would destroy everything.

776
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,000
<30-3,BECKETT>-纽约警局  -他们在里面
<30-3,BECKETT>- NYPD. - They're inside.

777
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,610
<30-5,KAYLA>安波儿的追悼会应该办的简单又不失品位
<30-5,KAYLA>The memorial for Amber should be simple, tasteful...

778
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,520
<30-6,BARON>-还要非常的典雅  -是的
<30-6,BARON>- And very, very classy. - Yes.

779
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,960
<30-7,KAYLA>探长
<30-7,KAYLA>Detective.

780
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,880
<30-8,BARON>有什么需要我帮忙的吗
<30-8,BARON>Is there something I can help you with?

781
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,200
<30-9,BECKETT>是的  我们需要问几个问题
<30-9,BECKETT>Yes, we need to ask you a few questions.

782
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,220
<30-10,BARON>问吧
<30-10,BARON>Ask away.

783
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,020
<30-11,BECKETT>好的
<30-11,BECKETT>Fine.

784
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,990
<30-11,BECKETT>告诉我们安波儿·米德伯瑞
<30-11,BECKETT>Tell us about the blackmail and the murder

785
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,930
<30-11,BECKETT>被敲诈和谋杀的实情
<30-11,BECKETT>of Amber Middleberry.

786
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,710
<30-12,BARON>关掉摄像机  出去
<30-12,BARON>Shut the cameras off. Go, now!

787
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:19,030
<30-13,BECKETT>我以为你说所有人都喜欢看花絮
<30-13,BECKETT>I thought you said that everybody loves the underbelly.

788
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,600
<30-15,KAYLA>这是怎么回事  维克多
<30-15,KAYLA>This... what's going on, Victor?

789
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,190
<30-16,CASTLE>事实上我们终于发现了
<30-16,CASTLE>What's going on is, we finally figured out who,

790
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,720
<30-16,CASTLE>除了安波儿
<30-16,CASTLE>aside from Amber...

791
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,500
<30-16,CASTLE>还有谁会因为这些照片而紧张
<30-16,CASTLE>would be nervous about these photos.

792
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,290
<30-17,KAYLA>什么照片
<30-17,KAYLA>What photos?

793
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,400
<30-17,KAYLA>我的天  我的天呐  维克多
<30-17,KAYLA>Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Victor.

794
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,850
<30-18,BARON>-我的天  -不是看上去的那样
<30-18,BARON>- Oh, my god! - I... it's not what it looks like.

795
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,490
<30-19,KAYLA>不是看上去的那样  这是
<30-19,KAYLA>It's not what it looks like? This is...

796
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,020
<30-19,KAYLA>这是我们在汉普顿的房子
<30-19,KAYLA>This is our house in the Hamptons.

797
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,630
<30-20,BARON>-这是我们的床  -这是我们度假用床
<30-20,BARON>- This is our bed. - It's our vacation bed.

798
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,740
<30-21,BECKETT>就在你在拍卖会上买的
<30-21,BECKETT>Right underneath the $2 million Picard

799
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,280
<30-21,BECKETT>那幅价值两百万的皮卡尔画下面
<30-21,BECKETT>that you purchased at the auction,

800
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,300
<30-21,BECKETT>也正是和挂在
<30-21,BECKETT>which just happens to be the companion

801
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,010
<30-21,BECKETT>你办公室的这幅是一对
<30-21,BECKETT>to this painting here in your office.

802
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,350
<30-22,CASTLE>《现代建筑》中他们为你写的文章
<30-22,CASTLE>We read all about it on the spread

803
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,460
<30-22,CASTLE>让我们知晓了一切
<30-22,CASTLE>they did on you in "Today's Architect."

804
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,780
<30-22,CASTLE>看上去你因为这幅皮卡尔而地位提升不少
<30-22,CASTLE>Looks as though you were hoisted on your own Picard.

805
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,980
<30-24,KAYLA>-我可以解释  -维克多  我们说好的
<30-24,KAYLA>- I can explain. - We agreed, Victor. Never again.

806
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,550
<30-25,BARON>那只是个周末
<30-25,BARON>It was just a weekend.

807
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,860
<30-26,KAYLA>只是个周末  我在汉普顿还有朋友
<30-26,KAYLA>Just a weekend? I have friends in the Hamptons.

808
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,510
<30-26,KAYLA>要是有人看到了怎么办
<30-26,KAYLA>What if somebody saw?

809
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,670
<30-26,KAYLA>我会因为你管不好
<30-26,KAYLA>I won't be humiliated

810
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,700
<30-26,KAYLA>自己的小弟弟而丢尽脸面的
<30-26,KAYLA>because you can't keep it in your pants!

811
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,060
<30-27,BARON>-没人看到  -没人看到
<30-27,BARON>- No one saw. - No one saw.

812
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,260
<30-28,KAYLA>不  你拍了照好让所有人都能看到
<30-28,KAYLA>No, you took photos so everyone could see.

813
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,010
<30-29,BARON>那些照片不是我拍的
<30-29,BARON>I didn't take those pictures.

814
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,330
<30-30,BECKETT>我是这么想的  安波儿被敲诈了
<30-30,BECKETT>Here's what I think happened... Amber was being blackmailed.

815
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,370
<30-30,BECKETT>她支付不了  所以她找到你帮忙
<30-30,BECKETT>She couldn't pay, so she came to you for help.

816
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,850
<30-31,CASTLE>但是你为了大局着想  这些照片
<30-31,CASTLE>Only you had a lot to lose, and those pictures,

817
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,490
<30-31,CASTLE>终究是会传出去的
<30-31,CASTLE>they have a way of getting out.

818
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,430
<30-32,BECKETT>于是你没有付敲诈者钱  而是杀了他
<30-32,BECKETT>So instead of paying off her blackmailer, you killed him,

819
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,350
<30-32,BECKETT>然后你回到这里把她解决了
<30-32,BECKETT>and then you came back here to take care of her.

820
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,800
<30-33,BARON>不是这样的
<30-33,BARON>That's not what happened.

821
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,150
<30-34,BECKETT>已经没有摄像机在拍了  拜伦先生
<30-34,BECKETT>The cameras aren't rolling any longer, Mr. Baron.

822
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,120
<30-34,BECKETT>你不用再演戏了
<30-34,BECKETT>You can drop the act.

823
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,260
<30-35,BARON>我不是在演戏  安波儿没有被敲诈
<30-35,BARON>It's not an act. Amber wasn't being blackmailed.

824
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,380
<30-35,BARON>那个狡猾的婊子在敲诈我
<30-35,BARON>The conniving bitch was blackmailing me.

825
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,770
<30-36,BECKETT>她在敲诈你
<30-36,BECKETT>She was blackmailing you?

826
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,610
<30-37,BARON>她给我看了那些照片
<30-37,BARON>She showed me the pictures.

827
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,660
<30-37,BARON>她告诉我  她叫她男朋友
<30-37,BARON>She told me that she had her boyfriend come

828
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,110
<30-37,BARON>趁我不在时过来拍的
<30-37,BARON>and take 'em while I was away.

829
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,790
<30-38,KAYLA>等等  你把她一个人留在我的房子里
<30-38,KAYLA>Wait. You left her alone in my house?

830
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,710
<30-39,BARON>我当时要到市里开会  我马上就回去了
<30-39,BARON>I had a meeting in the city. I was coming right back.

831
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,560
<30-40,KAYLA>你怎么能这么笨呢  维克多
<30-40,KAYLA>How could you be so stupid, Victor?

832
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,340
<30-41,BARON>她说如果我帮她赢得选美比赛
<30-41,BARON>She said if helped her win the pageant,

833
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,670
<30-41,BARON>这些照片就不会被公开
<30-41,BARON>the photos would never see the light of day.

834
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,020
<30-41,BARON>你知道代价是什么  不付钱的话我就毁了你
<30-41,BARON>"You know the price. Pay up or I'll destroy you."

835
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,150
<30-42,CASTLE>这不是写给安波儿的  而是安波儿写的
<30-42,CASTLE>It wasn't to Amber. It was from amber.

836
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,300
<30-42,CASTLE>她还和她的男朋友在一起
<30-42,CASTLE>She was still with her boyfriend.

837
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,830
<30-42,CASTLE>他们两个人合谋
<30-42,CASTLE>They were in it together.

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,030
<30-43,BECKETT>那你做了什么
<30-43,BECKETT>So then what did you do?

839
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,600
<30-44,BARON>我偷偷把选美的问题给了她
<30-44,BARON>I slipped her the pageant questions.

840
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,040
<30-44,BARON>要不然她怎么会答得那么好
<30-44,BARON>Why do you think she was doing so well?

841
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:05,860
<30-45,KAYLA>你个混蛋
<30-45,KAYLA>You ass!

842
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,820

<30-47,BARON>招待会结束后
<30-47,BARON>After the reception,

845
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:17,270
<30-47,BARON>我和市议员博林杰一起喝了点酒
<30-47,BARON>I had drinks with councilman Bollinger.

846
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,200
<30-47,BARON>我大概凌晨一点到的家
<30-47,BARON>Uh, I got home at, uh, at 1:00 a.m.

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,950
<30-47,BARON>凯拉和我在一起  是吧  宝贝
<30-47,BARON>Kayla was with me, weren't you, babe?

848
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:25,590
<30-48,BECKETT>凯拉  是真的吗  你和他在一起吗
<30-48,BECKETT>Kayla, is this true? Were you with him?

849
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,310
<30-48,BECKETT>是的
<30-48,BECKETT>Yes.

850
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,780
<30-49,KAYLA>还有谁知道  维克多
<30-49,KAYLA>Who else knew, Victor?

851
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,580
<30-49,KAYLA>我还要在谁面前丢脸
<30-49,KAYLA>Who do I need to be ashamed in front of?

852
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,690
<30-50,BARON>没有人知道了
<30-50,BARON>No one else knew.

853
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:40,800
<30-51,BECKETT>肯定还有人知道
<30-51,BECKETT>Well, someone else must've,

854
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,270
<30-51,BECKETT>要不然这两个人就不会死了
<30-51,BECKETT>otherwise two people wouldn't be dead.

855
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,650
<30-52,BARON>我只告诉了坎迪丝一个人
<30-52,BARON>The only other person I told was Candace.

856
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,310
<30-52,BARON>我告诉了她安波儿的企图
<30-52,BARON>I told her what amber was trying to do...

857
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,810
<30-52,BARON>勒索我  在比赛中作弊
<30-52,BARON>to me, to the pageant.

858
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,740
<30-52,BARON>我让她帮我解决
<30-52,BARON>I told her to take care of it,

859
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,050
<30-52,BARON>让她把问题解决掉
<30-52,BARON>to make the problem go away.

860
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,990
<30-53,CASTLE>也许她这么做了
<30-53,CASTLE>Maybe she did.

861
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,270
<31-1,CANDACE>我不想在这些玻璃杯上看到一点指纹
<31-1,CANDACE>I don't want to see any fingerprints on those glasses.

862
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,400
<31-2,CASTLE>对指纹还挺小心的嘛  坎迪丝
<31-2,CASTLE>Being careful of fingerprints, are we, Candace?

863
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,730
<31-3,CANDACE>我们想让一切都很完美
<31-3,CANDACE>We want everything to be perfect.

864
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,700
<31-4,BECKETT>这场选美真是你的心头肉
<31-4,BECKETT>This pageant really is your baby.

865
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,120
<31-5,CANDACE>你注意到了  完美的17年
<31-5,CANDACE>You noticed? 17 flawless years.

866
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,750
<31-6,BECKETT>那么你会不惜一切代价来保护它
<31-6,BECKETT>So then you would do anything to protect it.

867
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,580
<31-6,BECKETT>我们知道拜伦先生把敲诈的事情告诉了你
<31-6,BECKETT>We know that Mr. Baron told you about the blackmail.

868
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,610
<31-6,BECKETT>我们还知道他让你来解决这件事
<31-6,BECKETT>And we know that he asked you to handle it.

869
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,060
<32-1,CANDACE>杀她  我想杀了拜伦
<32-1,CANDACE>Kill her? I wanted to kill Baron.

870
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,840
<32-1,CANDACE>完美的17年  他想把答案给他的小三
<32-1,CANDACE>17 flawless years, and he wants me to give her the answers

871
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,990
<32-1,CANDACE>好让她能戴上王冠
<32-1,CANDACE>so his little fling can wear the crown?

872
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,430
<32-1,CANDACE>但如果不这么做
<32-1,CANDACE>But it was either that

873
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,130
<32-1,CANDACE>那个狐狸精就会毁了一切
<32-1,CANDACE>or that snake destroys everything.

874
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,650
<32-2,BECKETT>安波儿被杀的那个晚上你在哪里
<32-2,BECKETT>Where were you the night that Amber was killed?

875
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,180
<32-3,CANDACE>求你别
<32-3,CANDACE>Please don't.

876
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,800
<32-4,BECKETT>-弗德女士  -我和别人在一起
<32-4,BECKETT>- Ms. Ford  - I was with someone.

877
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,450
<32-6,CASTLE>谁
<32-6,CASTLE>Who?

878
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,150
<32-7,CANDACE>我不能说
<32-7,CANDACE>I can't.

879
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,000
<32-8,BECKETT>坎迪丝  如果你有不在场证明
<32-8,BECKETT>Candace, if you have an alibi...

880
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,050
<32-9,CANDACE>鲍比·斯塔克  我和他一起在翠贝卡酒店
<32-9,CANDACE>Bobby Stark. I was with him at the Tribeca Grand.

881
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,300
<32-9,CANDACE>而最糟的是
<32-9,CANDACE>And the worst part is...

882
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,970
<32-9,CANDACE>他甚至都不记得了
<32-9,CANDACE>he doesn't even remember.

883
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,960
<33-1,ESPOSITO>翠贝卡酒店确认了谋杀发生的时候
<33-1,ESPOSITO>Tribeca grand confirms that Stark was with Candace

884
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
<33-1,ESPOSITO>斯塔克和坎迪丝在一起
<33-1,ESPOSITO>at the time of the murder.

885
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,790
<33-2,CASTLE>她闻起来是有点草莓精油的味道
<33-2,CASTLE>She did smell a little bit like strawberry oil.

886
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,510
<33-3,ESPOSITO>拜伦的不在场证明也成立
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Baron's alibi checks out, too.

887
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,180
<33-4,BECKETT>我们没有嫌疑犯了
<33-4,BECKETT>Which leaves us without a suspect.

888
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,930
<33-4,BECKETT>去跟拜伦的律师交涉
<33-4,BECKETT>Okay, get into it with Baron's lawyers.

889
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,310
<33-4,BECKETT>坎迪丝没杀人
<33-4,BECKETT>Just because Candace didn't kill them

890
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,910
<33-4,BECKETT>-不代表他没买凶杀人  -好
<33-4,BECKETT>- doesn't mean he didn't hire someone else to do it. - Right.

891
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,330
<33-6,CASTLE>盲目而赤裸裸的野心  我想
<33-6,CASTLE>Blind, naked ambition-- I think

892
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,940
<33-6,CASTLE>就算黛比·文妮科也会感到厌恶的
<33-6,CASTLE>even your Debbie Winokur would've been appalled.

893
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,360
<33-7,BECKETT>她的确会
<33-7,BECKETT>Yeah, she would've.

894
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,110
<33-7,BECKETT>黛比想成为选美皇后
<33-7,BECKETT>Debbie wanted to be a beauty queen

895
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:18,410
<33-7,BECKETT>是因为她信仰完美之美
<33-7,BECKETT>because she believed in the ideals of beauty.

896
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,210
<33-7,BECKETT>她想达到秀外慧中的境界
<33-7,BECKETT>She wanted to be beautiful on the inside and outside.

897
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,330
<33-8,CASTLE>我以为你不喜欢她
<33-8,CASTLE>I thought you didn't like her.

898
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,550
<33-9,BECKETT>在她内心深处  在完美妆容和发型下
<33-9,BECKETT>Well, deep down, behind all of the makeup and the hair,

899
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,900
<33-9,BECKETT>她也不是一个烂人
<33-9,BECKETT>She wasn't terrible.

900
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,150
<33-9,BECKETT>只不过跟她住一起很难熬
<33-9,BECKETT>She was just a miserable person to live with.

901
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,740
<33-9,BECKETT>跟安波儿不一样  如果成功意味着作弊
<33-9,BECKETT>Unlike Amber, winning wouldn't have meant a thing to her

902
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,940
<33-9,BECKETT>那成功对她而言就一文不值
<33-9,BECKETT>if she had to cheat to do it.

903
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,830
<33-10,CASTLE>说起改变你人生的抉择
<33-10,CASTLE>Yeah, talk about choices that change your life.

904
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,170
<33-10,CASTLE>你是何时做出那种选择
<33-10,CASTLE>When do you make that choice?

905
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,090
<33-10,CASTLE>何时起赢得比赛
<33-10,CASTLE>When does winning become

906
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,450
<33-10,CASTLE>-比你的灵魂更重要  -不知道
<33-10,CASTLE>- more important than your soul? - I don't know.

907
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,220
<33-11,BECKETT>想要做出安波儿干出来的事
<33-11,BECKETT>You have to be pretty cold and calculating

908
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,570
<33-11,BECKETT>得非常冷酷非常精明才行
<33-11,BECKETT>to make some of the choices Amber did.

909
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,770
<33-12,CASTLE>冷酷精明
<33-12,CASTLE>Cold and calculating?

910
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,500
<33-13,BECKETT>什么
<33-13,BECKETT>What?

911
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,170
<33-14,CASTLE>安波儿冷酷又精明
<33-14,CASTLE>Amber was cold and calculating.

912
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,980
<33-15,BECKETT>那又怎样
<33-15,BECKETT>Yeah, so?

913
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,910
<33-16,CASTLE>这样说来  跟我们聊过她的人里
<33-16,CASTLE>So all of those people we talked to about her,

914
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,230
<33-16,CASTLE>有一个在说谎
<33-16,CASTLE>one of them is lying.

915
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,560
<34-1,JUSTIN>拜伦全美选美赛惨剧发生
<34-1,JUSTIN>Tragedy... struck the Baron's All-American Pageant

916
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,480
<34-1,JUSTIN>一位伊利诺伊洲选手意外而亡
<34-1,JUSTIN>with the untimely passing of our Illinois All-American,

917
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,870
<34-1,JUSTIN>安波儿·米德伯瑞小姐
<34-1,JUSTIN>Ms. Amber Middleberry.

918
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,670
<34-1,JUSTIN>我有幸曾与安波儿亲密共事
<34-1,JUSTIN>I was fortunate to have worked closely with Amber.

919
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,040
<34-1,JUSTIN>她对我而言意味着全世界
<34-1,JUSTIN>She meant the world to me.

920
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,710
<34-2,BECKETT>那你为什么杀死她
<34-2,BECKETT>Well, then why did you kill her?

921
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,820
<34-3,JUSTIN>什么  我没杀她
<34-3,JUSTIN>What? I didn't kill Amber.

922
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,830
<34-5,CASTLE>你在说谎  你一直都在说谎
<34-5,CASTLE>You're lying. You've been lying to us the whole time.

923
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,890
<34-6,BECKETT>你跟我们说她心烦意乱  说她感到
<34-6,BECKETT>You told us that she was upset, that she was feeling

924
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,880
<34-6,BECKETT>被人占了便宜  受到了威胁
<34-6,BECKETT>like she was being taken advantage of and threatened.

925
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,130
<34-7,CASTLE>但她才是威胁别人的人
<34-7,CASTLE>But she was the one doing the threatening.

926
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,450
<34-7,CASTLE>她没必要心烦意乱
<34-7,CASTLE>There was no reason for her to be upset.

927
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,420
<34-8,JUSTIN>你们打断了一次着装排演
<34-8,JUSTIN>You know, you're interrupting a dress rehearsal. Okay?

928
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,180
<34-8,JUSTIN>我都不知道你俩在说什么
<34-8,JUSTIN>I don't even know what you two are talking about.

929
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,580
<34-9,BECKETT>你完全清楚  你发现了勒索事件
<34-9,BECKETT>Oh, yes, you do. You got on to the blackmail.

930
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,630
<34-10,CASTLE>你以为她前男友想
<34-10,CASTLE>You thought the old boyfriend was taking advantage

931
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,520
<34-10,CASTLE>占你未来冠军的便宜  所以你找他对质
<34-10,CASTLE>of your prized client, so you confronted him.

932
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,220
<34-11,BECKETT>-我们查过你的信用卡  -得知
<34-11,BECKETT>- We ran your credit cards. - We know

933
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,520
<34-12,CASTLE>你乘出租车去了杰瑞米的公寓
<34-12,CASTLE>about the taxi trip you took to Jeremy's apartment.

934
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,610
<34-13,BECKETT>跟我们说说  你杀害安波儿男朋友时
<34-13,BECKETT>So tell us, when you killed Amber's boyfriend.

935
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,760
<34-13,BECKETT>可知道安波儿也参与了这场阴谋
<34-13,BECKETT>did you know that amber was in on the scheme?

936
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,800
<34-14,BECKETT>贾斯汀  站住
<34-14,BECKETT>Justin, stop.

937
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,060
<34-14,BECKETT>往哪儿跑呢
<34-14,BECKETT>Where are you going, aah!

938
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,430
<34-15,CASTLE>给你个建议  贾斯汀
<34-15,CASTLE>A word of advice, Justin.

939
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,440
<34-15,CASTLE>女士说站住
<34-15,CASTLE>When the lady says stop,

940
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,380
<34-14,BECKETT>那就站住
<34-14,BECKETT>stop.

941
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,680
<35-1,BECKETT>贾斯汀坦白了一切
<35-1,BECKETT>Justin confessed to everything.

942
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,280
<35-1,BECKETT>他之前三位客户不成气候
<35-1,BECKETT>His last three clients were losers.

943
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,930
<35-1,BECKETT>安波儿可使他重返巅峰  要是她输了
<35-1,BECKETT>Amber was supposed to be his comeback, and if she didn't win,

944
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:56,790
<35-1,BECKETT>他就完了
<35-1,BECKETT>he was through.

945
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,510
<35-1,BECKETT>显然我们发现的裸照他也发现了
<35-1,BECKETT>Apparently he found the same naked photos that we did,

946
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,430
<35-1,BECKETT>却以为她前男友想占她便宜
<35-1,BECKETT>thought that her ex-boyfriend was trying to exploit her.

947
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,430
<35-2,CASTLE>他很担心  要是他们报了警
<35-2,CASTLE>He was worried, if they called the cops,

948
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,800
<35-2,CASTLE>她的秘密就会曝光  他俩都玩儿完
<35-2,CASTLE>that her secret would get out, and they'd both be ruined.

949
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,750
<35-2,CASTLE>所以打算自己解决
<35-2,CASTLE>So he decided to handle it on his own.

950
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,310
<35-2,CASTLE>倒霉的是杰瑞米喝醉了
<35-2,CASTLE>Unfortunately, Jeremy was drunk,

951
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,310
<35-2,CASTLE>动了手  结果贾斯汀杀了他
<35-2,CASTLE>He got violent, and Justin ended up killing him.

952
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,730
<35-3,BECKETT>把他现场布置成自杀
<35-3,BECKETT>And he staged it like it was a suicide.

953
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,750
<35-3,BECKETT>安波儿发现后  威胁要告发他
<35-3,BECKETT>Once Amber found out, she threatened to turn him in,

954
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,810
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>-他就把她也杀了  -可真是一错连一错
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>- And he killed her. - That's a whole pageant of bad choices.

955
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,310
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>你俩干得漂亮
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>Good work, you two.

956
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,450
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>-你们都很棒  -谢谢
<35-4,MONTGOMERY>- Uh, good work, you all. - Thank you.

957
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,600
<35-6,CASTLE>我看到一位值得授予桂冠的选美皇后
<35-6,CASTLE>I see a beauty queen worthy of a crown.

958
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,270
<35-7,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>你嘴总这么甜  里克
<35-7,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>Always the charmer, Rick.

959

<35-7,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>亲爱的  你怎么来了
<35-7,EVELYN MONTGOMERY>Baby, what you doin' here?

960
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,790
<35-8,MONTGOMERY>你明知我会去接你的
<35-8,MONTGOMERY>You know I was just comin' to swoop you up.

961
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,530
<35-9,EVELYN>我知道你工作起来
<35-9,EVELYN>Yeah, well, I know how you lose all sense of time

962
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,320
<35-9,EVELYN>废寝忘食  所以想直接过来找你
<35-9,EVELYN>when you're working. I figured I'd meet you here.

963
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,800
<35-11,BECKETT>你们有什么计划没
<35-11,BECKETT>Do you guys have any big plans?

964

<35-12,EVELYN>Dinner and dancing with the best husband in Manhattan,

965
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,340
<35-12,EVELYN>早上他送我礼物后  这就变得更加美妙了
<35-12,EVELYN>especially since he gave me that gift this morning.

966
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,390
<35-13,CASTLE>你最后送她什么了
<35-13,CASTLE>Oh, what did you end up giving her?

967
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,120
<35-14,MONTGOMERY>卡塞尔  我听了你的建议
<35-14,MONTGOMERY>I followed your advice, Castle.

968
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,110
<35-14,MONTGOMERY>我想到过去几年
<35-14,MONTGOMERY>I thought about some of the things

<35-18,MONTGOMERY>我该放手前行了
<35-18,MONTGOMERY>It's time for me to move on.

996
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,770
<35-32,BECKETT>他就像是纽约警局的布雷特·法夫尔
<35-32,BECKETT>He's like the Brett Favre of the NYPD.

997
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,590
<35-33,CASTLE>相信我  他哪儿也不会去
<35-33,CASTLE>Trust me. He's not going anywhere.
