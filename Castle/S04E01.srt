<10-2,MARTHA>You are not the one who shot her.

152
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,100
<10-2,MARTHA>电量到10
<10-2,MARTHA>Charge to 10.

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,520
<11-1,NURSE>充好了
<11-1,NURSE>Charged.

154
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,110
<11-2,KOVAKS>准备就绪
<11-2,KOVAKS>Clear.

155
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,480
<11-2,KOVAKS>不
<11-2,KOVAKS>No.

156
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,900
<12-1,CASTLE>但是我让她身处险境
<12-1,CASTLE>But I put her in the crosshairs.

157
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,740
<13-1,KOVAKS>还在颤动  电量加到20
<13-1,KOVAKS>Still fibrillating. Charge to 20.

158
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,620
<13-2,NURSE>充电中
<13-2,NURSE>Charging.

159
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,790
<13-2,NURSE>我向她表露了心声
<13-2,NURSE>I told her how I felt.

160
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,380
<13-2,NURSE>我告诉她  我爱她
<13-2,NURSE>I told her I loved her.

161
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,800
<13-2,NURSE>准备就绪
<13-2,NURSE>Clear.

171
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,490
<16-1,KOVAKS>贝克特先生
<16-1,KOVAKS>Mr. Beckett?

172
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,080
<16-2,JIM BECKETT>是我
<16-2,JIM BECKETT>Yes.

173
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,560
<16-3,KOVAKS>你女儿已做完手术了
<16-3,KOVAKS>Your daughter is out of surgery.

174
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,300
<16-4,JIM BECKETT>她会没事吗
<16-4,JIM BECKETT>Will she be all right?

175
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,340
<16-5,KOVAKS>手术期间  她曾心脏骤停
<16-5,KOVAKS>Well, during the surgery, she experienced cardiac arrest.

176
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,480
<16-5,KOVAKS>我们让她的心脏自动重跳了
<16-5,KOVAKS>Now we were able to get her heart beating again on its own,

177
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,790
<16-5,KOVAKS>但是  我们需要密切观察她
<16-5,KOVAKS>But... we'll need to watch her very closely.

178
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,910
<16-6,JIM BECKETT>我什么时候能见她
<16-6,JIM BECKETT>When can I see her?

179
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,120
<16-7,KOVAKS>等护士把她安顿好
<16-7,KOVAKS>Well, once the nurses get her settled,

180
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,140
<16-7,KOVAKS>我们会带您去见她
<16-7,KOVAKS>we'll bring you back to her.

181
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,910
<16-7,KOVAKS>其余人该回家休息了
<16-7,KOVAKS>The rest of you should go home, get some rest.

182
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,210
<16-8,ESPOSITO>我不知道你  兄弟
<16-8,ESPOSITO>I don't know about you, bro,

183
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,090
<16-8,ESPOSITO>但是我最不想的就是回家
<16-8,ESPOSITO>but home is the last place I'm going.

184
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,160
<16-8,ESPOSITO>等我们抓到那该死的凶手再说
<16-8,ESPOSITO>Not till we catch the son of a bitch who did this.

185
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,280
<16-9,RYAN>我跟你一样
<16-9,RYAN>Right behind you.

186
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,910
<16-10,MARTHA>我们没事  去吧
<16-10,MARTHA>We're fine. Go.

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,570
<16-11,MARTHA>你还好吗
<16-11,MARTHA>Are you okay?

188
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,030
<16-11,MARTHA>挺好
<16-11,MARTHA>Yeah.

189
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,600
<17-1,RYAN>枪手的步枪
<17-1,RYAN>The shooter's rifle.

190
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,820
<17-1,RYAN>没有找到指纹
<17-1,RYAN>It's clean for prints.

191
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,480
<17-1,RYAN>实验室现在在寻找DNA的残留
<17-1,RYAN>Lab's running trace right now for D.N.A.

192
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,460
<17-2,CASTLE>那枪呢  能追查到枪的来源吗
<17-2,CASTLE>Well, what about the gun? Can we track the gun?

193
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,560
<17-3,ESPOSITO>国防部称  该枪序列号对应的枪主
<17-3,ESPOSITO>According to the D.O.D., the serial number matches a weapon

194
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,760
<17-3,ESPOSITO>是一个叫马丁·霍斯特的人
<17-3,ESPOSITO>that was issued to one Martin Holst,

195
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,700
<17-3,ESPOSITO>7年前在一次行动中身亡的海豹突击队员
<17-3,ESPOSITO>a Navy Seal who was killed in action seven years ago.

196
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,430
<17-3,ESPOSITO>他的尸体在后来的行动中找到
<17-3,ESPOSITO>His body was recovered in a subsequent mission,

197
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,930
<17-3,ESPOSITO>但是武器丢了
<17-3,ESPOSITO>but the weapon was not.

198
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,240
<17-3,ESPOSITO>警犬科有何发现
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Anything from the canine unit?

199
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,320
<17-4,RYAN>警犬嗅到一股气味
<17-4,RYAN>Dogs picked up a scent.

200
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,720
<17-4,RYAN>一路延续到墓地的西边
<17-4,RYAN>Traced it to the west side of the cemetery,

201
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,960
<17-4,RYAN>但之后就没有痕迹了
<17-4,RYAN>but then they lost it there.

202
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,230
<17-5,CASTLE>在全是警察的地方  他怎么能不引起注意
<17-5,CASTLE>In a sea of cops, how does this guy go unnoticed?

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,560
<17-6,RYAN>或许也不是没人看到
<17-6,RYAN>He may not have.

204
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,220
<17-6,RYAN>我们调查的半数的人称  记得看见过
<17-6,RYAN>Half the guys we talked to said they remember seeing

205
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,380
<17-6,RYAN>一名墓地管理员为躲避枪手  藏在一棵树后
<17-6,RYAN>a groundskeeper taking cover from the shooter behind a tree.

206
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,660
<17-6,RYAN>但墓园的工作人员说
<17-6,RYAN>But according to the grounds staff,

207
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,850
<17-6,RYAN>他们当时都不在那边
<17-6,RYAN>none of them were in the area.

208
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,970
<17-7,ESPOSITO>他在骚乱中混入人群  然后消失了
<17-7,ESPOSITO>He blended in during the chaos and then disappeared.

209
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,440
<17-8,CASTLE>如果这人是受雇的职业杀手
<17-8,CASTLE>If this guy's some pro for hire,

210
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,950
<17-8,CASTLE>他现在很可能在逃往古巴的路上了
<17-8,CASTLE>he could be halfway to cuba by now.

211
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,260
<17-9,ESPOSITO>那我们就去古巴找他
<17-9,ESPOSITO>Then we'll go to cuba and find his ass.

212
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,930
<17-10,CASTLE>这说不通
<17-10,CASTLE>It just doesn't make any sense.

213
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,270
<17-10,CASTLE>这一切本该结束的
<17-10,CASTLE>It was supposed to be over.

214
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,260
<17-10,CASTLE>蒙哥马利牺牲了自己
<17-10,CASTLE>Montgomery sacrificed himself.

215
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,990
<17-10,CASTLE>杀了洛克伍德  和他的所有手下
<17-10,CASTLE>Killing Lockwood and all of his guys,

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,450
<17-10,CASTLE>他说了他会了结此事
<17-10,CASTLE>he said he was ending it.

217
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,760
<17-10,CASTLE>他说他这么做是为了保证她的安全
<17-10,CASTLE>He said he was doing it to keep her safe.

218
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,250
<17-10,CASTLE>如果目的是为了保护她
<17-10,CASTLE>So if the plan was to keep her safe,

219
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,080
<17-10,CASTLE>那他们为何还要来杀她
<17-10,CASTLE>then why the hell are they still coming after her?

220
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,720
<17-11,ESPOSITO>我不知道  伙计
<17-11,ESPOSITO>I don't know, bro.

221
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,960
<17-11,ESPOSITO>天知道还牵扯到别的什么人
<17-11,ESPOSITO>God knows who else is involved.

227
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,660
<17-11,ESPOSITO>我是卡塞尔
<17-11,ESPOSITO>Castle.

228
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,790
<18-1,CASTLE>是的  你确定吗
<18-1,CASTLE>Yeah. Are you sure?

229
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,060
<18-1,CASTLE>不  这手环你戴着好看
<18-1,CASTLE>No, this bracelet looks good on you.

230
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,280
<19-1,JOSH>虽不是镶钻的
<19-1,JOSH>It's not diamonds.

231
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,780
<19-2,BECKETT>嗨  卡塞尔
<19-2,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

232
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,140
<19-3,JOSH>我查完房回来看你
<19-3,JOSH>I'll see you after rounds.

233
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,680
<19-4,CASTLE>好啊
<19-4,CASTLE>Yeah.

234
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,350
<19-5,BECKETT>你盯着我  我看起来一定很糟糕
<19-5,BECKETT>You're staring at me. I must look really bad.

235
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,350
<19-5,BECKETT>不
<19-5,BECKETT>No.

236
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,560
<19-6,CASTLE>我只是没想到能再见到你
<19-6,CASTLE>I just never thought I'd see you again.

237
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,730
<19-7,CASTLE>我听说你这儿要开花店
<19-7,CASTLE>I heard you were opening a flower store,

238
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,360
<19-7,CASTLE>所以想做点贡献
<19-7,CASTLE>so I thought I'd pitch in.

239
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,260
<19-8,BECKETT>我醒来的时候  它们就在这儿
<19-8,BECKETT>They were all here when I woke up.

240
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,960
<19-8,BECKETT>我想大多是分局同事送的
<19-8,BECKETT>I think they're mostly from the precinct.

241
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,140
<19-8,BECKETT>真是丢大人了  卡塞尔
<19-8,BECKETT>I don't think I'm gonna live this one down, Castle.

242
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,900
<19-9,CASTLE>还好啦
<19-9,CASTLE>Oh... probably not.

243
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,120
<19-10,BECKETT>我听说你还试着救我
<19-10,BECKETT>I hear that you tried to save me.

244
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,370
<19-11,CASTLE>是啊  我...
<19-11,CASTLE>Yeah, I, uh...

245
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,430
<19-12,CASTLE>你听说
<19-12,CASTLE>You heard?

246
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,730
<19-12,CASTLE>你不记得我扑倒你吗
<19-12,CASTLE>You don't remember me tackling you?

247
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,480
<19-13,BECKETT>不  我不大记得了
<19-13,BECKETT>No, I don't remember much of anything.

248
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,600
<19-14,BECKETT>我记得我当时在台上
<19-14,BECKETT>I, um, remember that I was on the podium.

249
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,430
<19-14,BECKETT>之后的事都一片漆黑
<19-14,BECKETT>And then I remember everything just going black.

250
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,000
<19-15,CASTLE>你不记得
<19-15,CASTLE>You don't remember...

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,330
<19-16,CASTLE>枪击了
<19-16,CASTLE>The gunshot?

252
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,460
<19-17,BECKETT>不记得了
<19-17,BECKETT>No.

253
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,110
<19-18,BECKETT>常言道  有些事情
<19-18,BECKETT>They say that there are some things

254
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,110
<19-18,BECKETT>还是不记得为好
<19-18,BECKETT>that are better not being remembered.

255
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,780
<19-19,CASTLE>是啊
<19-19,CASTLE>Yeah.

256
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,180
<19-20,BECKETT>我总是想起他  卡塞尔
<19-20,BECKETT>I keep seeing his face, Castle.

257
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,080
<19-20,BECKETT>每当我闭上双眼
<19-20,BECKETT>Every time I close my eyes,

258
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,830
<19-20,BECKETT>就看到蒙哥马利躺在机库的地上
<19-20,BECKETT>I see Montgomery lying on the hangar floor.

259
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,560
<45-10,MITCH>你应该让我去的
<45-10,MITCH>You shoulda let me go in there.

260
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,610
<19-21,CASTLE>那他们就会杀了你
<19-21,CASTLE>They would've killed you.

261
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,300
<19-22,BECKETT>那可不一定
<19-22,BECKETT>Oh, you don't know that.

262
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,900
<19-23,CASTLE>-凯特  -卡塞尔
<19-23,CASTLE>- Kate-- - Castle...

<19-24,BECKETT>right now.

<19-25,CASTLE>是啊

<19-26,BECKETT>我们可以不谈吗
<19-26,BECKETT>Do you mind if we don't?

268
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,650
<19-27,BECKETT>我只是需要一点时间
<19-27,BECKETT>I just need a little bit of time.

272
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
<19-28,CASTLE>好的
<19-28,CASTLE>Sure.

274
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,870
<20-1,PHONE OPERATOR>美国国会大厦  请问您要转接哪里
<20-1,PHONE OPERATOR>United States Capitol. How may I direct your call?

275
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,500
<20-2,MYSTERY MAN>国会办公室  谢谢
<20-2,MYSTERY MAN>Congressional offices, please.

277
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,810
<20-3,PHONE OPERATOR>请稍等
<20-3,PHONE OPERATOR>Hold, please.

278
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,930
<21-1,RYAN>你好啊  贝克特  你在这里干什么
<21-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. What are you doing here?

279
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,450
<21-1,RYAN>我还以为你下周才回来呢
<21-1,RYAN>I didn't think you were back till next week.

280
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,120
<21-2,BECKETT>整整两个月闷在我爸的小木屋里
<21-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, two months of listening to crickets

281
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,460
<21-2,BECKETT>听山间虫鸣
<21-2,BECKETT>in my dad's cabin...

282
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,000
<21-2,BECKETT>要把我逼疯了
<21-2,BECKETT>was driving me nuts.

283
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,330
<21-3,ESPOSITO>没事的  你不用找理由
<21-3,ESPOSITO>It's okay. You don't have to make excuses.

284
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,970
<21-3,ESPOSITO>我们知道你想我们  所以才会回来
<21-3,ESPOSITO>We know you missed us. That's why you couldn't stay away.

285
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,070
<21-4,BECKETT>得了吧
<21-4,BECKETT>Shut up.

286
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,580
<21-5,BECKETT>怎么样  有什么发现
<21-5,BECKETT>So? Anything?

287
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,020
<21-6,RYAN>依旧毫无进展
<21-6,RYAN>Still nowhere.

288
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,640
<21-7,BECKETT>那个墓地管理员呢
<21-7,BECKETT>Well, what about the groundskeeper?

289
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,080
<21-8,RYAN>那个人消失了
<21-8,RYAN>The guy's a ghost.

290
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,310
<21-8,RYAN>我们用监控录像找人  找车牌
<21-8,RYAN>We ran face hits on surveillance, license plates.

291
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,390
<21-8,RYAN>没查到东西
<21-8,RYAN>Nothing panned out.

292
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,130
<21-9,ESPOSITO>我们倒是在凶器上提取到了DNA
<21-9,ESPOSITO>We did get D.N.A. off the weapon,

293
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,950
<21-9,ESPOSITO>但是系统中没有相匹配的
<21-9,ESPOSITO>but there were no matches in the system.

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,170
<21-9,ESPOSITO>不过我们做了标记
<21-9,ESPOSITO>We flagged it, though.

295
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,120
<21-10,RYAN>这些卡塞尔都没告诉你吗
<21-10,RYAN>Uh, didn't Castle tell you about all this?

296
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,560
<21-11,BECKETT>没有
<21-11,BECKETT>No.

297
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,410
<21-12,ESPOSITO>真奇怪  他为什么会向你隐瞒
<21-12,ESPOSITO>That's weird. Why wouldn't he--why would he hide that from you?

298
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,230
<21-13,BECKETT>他没有隐瞒什么  只是我有段时间没见他了
<21-13,BECKETT>He's not hiding anything. I just haven't see him in a while.

299
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,380
<21-14,ESPOSITO>有段时间是多久
<21-14,ESPOSITO>How long is a while?

300
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,020
<21-15,BECKETT>差不多就是枪击后吧
<21-15,BECKETT>Pretty much since the shooting.

301
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,890
<21-16,RYAN>为什么  出什么事了
<21-16,RYAN>Why? What happened?

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,250
<21-17,BECKETT>啥事没有  我只是需要时间休整
<21-17,BECKETT>Nothing happened. I just needed some time.

303
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,980
<21-18,ESPOSITO>怎么  他整整三个月对你不闻不问
<21-18,ESPOSITO>What, he left you alone for three months?

304
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,160
<21-19,BECKETT>行了  不是他的错
<21-19,BECKETT>You guys, it wasn't his fault.

305
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,840
<21-19,BECKETT>我跟他说等我电话
<21-19,BECKETT>I told him that I would call.

306
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,320
<21-20,ESPOSITO>那你为什么没打
<21-20,ESPOSITO>Well, why didn't you?

307
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,640
<21-21,ESPOSITO>他每天都来这里和我们一起查案
<21-21,ESPOSITO>He was here with us every day, working the case,

308
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,120
<21-22,ESPOSITO>查了好几个月
<21-22,ESPOSITO>for months.

309
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,290
<21-22,ESPOSITO>要不是新警监
<21-22,ESPOSITO>He'd still be here

310
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,380
<21-22,ESPOSITO>把他撵走了  他还会待在这
<21-22,ESPOSITO>if the new captain hadn't kicked him to the curb.

311
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,100
<21-23,BECKETT>她把他撵走了  为什么
<21-23,BECKETT>She kicked him out? Why?

312
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,460
<21-24,RYAN>显然  她的分局
<21-24,RYAN>Apparently, uh, her precinct's

313
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,790
<21-24,RYAN>容不下一个半吊子作家
<21-24,RYAN>got no room for a dilettante writer

314
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,510
<21-24,RYAN>扮警察玩
<21-24,RYAN>playing cop.

315
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,390
<21-24,RYAN>维克多利亚·盖茨警监
<21-24,RYAN>Captain Victoria Gates,

316
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,020
<21-24,RYAN>绰号铁娘子盖茨
<21-24,RYAN>A.K.A. Iron Gates.

317
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,470
<21-24,RYAN>严格按照规章办事
<21-24,RYAN>As by-the-book as they come.

318
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,070
<21-24,RYAN>她是从内务处磨练出来的探长
<21-24,RYAN>She cut her teeth as a detective with Internal Affairs.

319
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,420
<21-25,BECKETT>那可不是招人喜欢的差事
<21-25,BECKETT>Wow. That's not gonna win her any popularity points.

320
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,140
<21-26,RYAN>是啊  她似乎把对警察的不信任也带来了
<21-26,RYAN>Yeah. It's like she brought her distrust of cops along with her.

321
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,440
<21-27,ESPOSITO>至少可以确定一点  她与蒙哥马利不同
<21-27,ESPOSITO>Well, one thing's for sure, she's no Montgomery.

322
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,310
<21-28,RYAN>她还没和卡塞尔谈过
<21-28,RYAN>Hey, she hasn't talked to Castle.

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,520
<21-28,RYAN>-她还不知道银行的事  -什么银行
<21-28,RYAN>- She doesn't know about the bank yet. - What bank?

324
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,120
<21-30,ESPOSITO>反正我们追查枪手毫无进展
<21-30,ESPOSITO>Uh, well, we weren't getting any traction with the shooter,

325
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,920
<21-30,ESPOSITO>所以卡塞尔建议我们调查一下
<21-30,ESPOSITO>so Castle suggested we check out

326
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,630
<21-30,ESPOSITO>蒙哥马利  麦卡利斯特和拉格兰
<21-30,ESPOSITO>Montgomery, Mccallister, and Raglan.

327
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,490
<21-30,ESPOSITO>看看他们以前可能在和谁做交易
<21-30,ESPOSITO>See who they might have been in business with back in the day.

328
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,630
<21-31,RYAN>我们知道他们是靠绑架黑帮成员牟利
<21-31,RYAN>We know those guys were getting fat ransoming wise guys.

329
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,010
<21-31,RYAN>或许他们用那个小金库
<21-31,RYAN>Maybe they used that stash

330
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,880
<21-31,RYAN>去支付谋杀你母亲的凶手的酬劳
<21-31,RYAN>to pay off the guy that ordered your mother's murder.

331
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,920
<21-32,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔认为他找到了他们用过的银行
<21-32,ESPOSITO>Yeah, so Castle thinks he found the bank they used.

332
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,130
<21-33,BECKETT>这么说有条钱财线索
<21-33,BECKETT>So there's a money trail.

333
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,880
<21-34,RYAN>唯一的问题是  银行倒闭了
<21-34,RYAN>The only problem is, the bank closed down.

334
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,060
<21-34,RYAN>没人知道那些历史记录在哪里
<21-34,RYAN>No one knows where those old records ended up.

335
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,950
<21-35,ESPOSITO>我们正在设法寻找的时候
<21-35,ESPOSITO>We were working to locate them

336
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,950
<21-35,ESPOSITO>铁娘子盖茨叫停了调查
<21-35,ESPOSITO>when iron Gates shut down the investigation.

337
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,450
<21-36,BECKETT>什么  她叫停了调查  为什么
<21-36,BECKETT>W--she shut the case down? Why?

338
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,010
<21-37,RYAN>没有枪手的新线索
<21-37,RYAN>No new leads on the shooter.

339
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,660
<21-37,RYAN>而且如果我们告诉她其他案情
<21-37,RYAN>And we couldn't tell her the rest of it

340
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,950
<21-37,RYAN>就必然会涉及到蒙哥马利警监
<21-37,RYAN>without implicating Captain Montgomery.

341
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,620
<21-37,RYAN>女士
<21-37,RYAN>Ma'am.

342
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,770
<22-2,GATES>要是我妈过来拜访  你倒是可以叫她女士
<22-2,GATES>If my mother drops by, you can call her ma'am.

343
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,170
<22-2,GATES>叫我长官或者警监
<22-2,GATES>Call me sir or Captain.

<22-3,BECKETT>Back on active as of today.

<22-3,BECKETT>Detective Beckett.

347
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,240
<22-4,GATES>久闻大名
<22-4,GATES>Your reputation precedes you.

348
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,000
<22-4,GATES>纽约警局史上最年轻女探长
<22-4,GATES>Youngest woman in the NYPD to make detective.

349
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,710
<22-4,GATES>比我早了六周
<22-4,GATES>You beat me by six weeks.

350
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,570
<22-5,BECKETT>我没想到这都有记录
<22-5,BECKETT>I didn't realize that people kept score.

351
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,740
<22-6,GATES>人人心中有杆秤  探长
<22-6,GATES>Everybody keeps score, detective,

352
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,710
<22-6,GATES>特别是市局的人
<22-6,GATES>especially those downtown.

353
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,930
<22-7,GATES>看来你通过了心理评估
<22-7,GATES>Looks like you passed your psych eval,

354
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,500
<22-7,GATES>那么  欢迎回来

<22-8,BECKETT>Thank you. Uh, I-I'll also need my gun.

356
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,860
<22-9,GATES>等你重获资格了再给你
<22-9,GATES>Not until you requalify.

357
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,020
<22-10,BECKETT>您说什么
<22-10,BECKETT>I'm sorry?

358
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,280
<22-11,GATES>你离职了三个月
<22-11,GATES>You were on disability for three months.

359
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,980
<22-11,GATES>按照规定你只有重获资格了之后
<22-11,GATES>Regs says you don't get your piece back

360
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,580
<22-11,GATES>才能拿回配枪
<22-11,GATES>until you requalify.

361
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,850
<22-12,BECKETT>那我的案子怎么办  规定里有说吗
<22-12,BECKETT>And what about my case? What do regs say about that?

362
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,650
<22-12,BECKETT>三个月毫无线索
<22-12,BECKETT>Three months and no leads,

363
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,130
<22-13,GATES>而每天都有新的凶案发生
<22-13,GATES>and every day, more homicides coming through that door?

364
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,670
<22-13,GATES>你指望我让他们一直摸黑乱撞下去吗
<22-13,GATES>How long did you expect me to let those folks tread water?

365
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,500
<22-13,GATES>调查这案子的都是好手
<22-13,GATES>There were good people on this case.

366
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,860
<22-13,GATES>只是根本没有线索可挖
<22-13,GATES>There just isn't anything out there--

367
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,860
<22-14,BECKETT>抱歉  长官  恕我直言  我和他们不一样
<22-14,BECKETT>I'm sorry, sir, but with all due respect, those people aren't me.

368
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,790
<22-15,GATES>你说什么
<22-15,GATES>Excuse me?

369
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,880
<22-16,BECKETT>你派去调查这案子的警员  没有我的能力
<22-16,BECKETT>The people that you had working this case, they're not me.

370
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,100
<22-17,GATES>听着  我不知道蒙哥马利
<22-17,GATES>Look, I don't know what kind of shop

371
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,480
<22-17,GATES>在这里时什么作风
<22-17,GATES>Montgomery was running here,

372
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,400
<22-17,GATES>但我绝不会允许任何一个警察调查
<22-17,GATES>but it'll be a cold day in hell if I let a cop--any cop--

373
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,210
<22-17,GATES>自己被枪击的案件
<22-17,GATES>investigate their own shooting.

374
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,530
<22-17,GATES>我的分局不是报仇雪恨的地方
<22-17,GATES>My precinct is no place for vendettas.

375
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,810
<22-18,GATES>这回话说清楚了吗
<22-18,GATES>Do we understand each other?

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,410
<27-8,BECKETT>我不知道  也许是不想再次伤得那么痛
<27-8,BECKETT>I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to hurt like that again.

482
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,570
<27-8,BECKETT>我知道我成不了
<27-8,BECKETT>I know I'm not gonna be able to be

483
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,540
<27-8,BECKETT>我想要成为的那种人
<27-8,BECKETT>the kind of person that I want to be,

484
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,010
<27-8,BECKETT>我知道我无法
<27-8,BECKETT>I know I'm not gonna...

485
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,920
<27-9,BECKETT>无法获得想要的那种感情
<27-9,BECKETT>I'm not gonna be able to have the kind of relationship that I want...

486
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,060
<27-9,BECKETT>除非这堵心墙倒塌
<27-9,BECKETT>until that wall comes down.

487
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,770
<27-9,BECKETT>这事不解决
<27-9,BECKETT>And it's not gonna happen

488
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,570
<27-9,BECKETT>我的心结无法解开
<27-9,BECKETT>till I put this thing to rest.

489
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,800
<27-10,CASTLE>那么我想我们必须要...
<27-10,CASTLE>Well, then I suppose we're just gonna have to...

490
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,270
<27-10,CASTLE>把这些家伙找出来  把他们解决掉
<27-10,CASTLE>find these guys and take 'em down.

491
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,000
<27-11,CASTLE>这不代表我不生气了
<27-11,CASTLE>That doesn't mean I'm not still mad.

492
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,980
<27-12,BECKETT>他俩跟我说了你做的那些事
<27-12,BECKETT>The boys told me about what you did,

493
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,570
<27-12,BECKETT>从钱的线索下手
<27-12,BECKETT>following the money trail,

494
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,510
<27-12,BECKETT>试着查出他们把钱转给了谁
<27-12,BECKETT>trying to track down who the cops paid off.

495
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,170
<27-13,CASTLE>我只是希望找到突破口
<27-13,CASTLE>I just wish it led somewhere.

496
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,580
<27-13,CASTLE>我查到了那些文件  银行倒闭的时候
<27-13,CASTLE>I mean, I located their files. When the bank closed,

497
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,170
<27-13,CASTLE>他们把那些死账的文件都拿走了
<27-13,CASTLE>they took all the dead account paperwork

498
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,340
<27-13,CASTLE>存放在尤宁城的一间仓库里
<27-13,CASTLE>and stored it in a warehouse in Union City,

499
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,150
<27-13,CASTLE>但在搬迁的几年后
<27-13,CASTLE>but a couple years after the move,

500
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,220
<27-13,CASTLE>一场大火把所有文件都烧了
<27-13,CASTLE>a fire broke out, and the files were destroyed.

501
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,690
<27-13,CASTLE>又是死胡同一条
<27-13,CASTLE>It's just another dead end.

502
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,760
<27-14,BECKETT>是怎么起火的
<27-14,BECKETT>How'd it happen?

503
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,710
<27-15,CASTLE>那场意外  电线老化
<27-15,CASTLE>It was an accident. It was old wiring.

504
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,680
<27-16,BECKETT>你确定吗
<27-16,BECKETT>Are you sure?

505
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,140
<27-17,CASTLE>是的  有过调查的
<27-17,CASTLE>Yeah, there was an investigation.

506
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,930
<27-18,BECKETT>你看过火灾调查员的报告了吗
<27-18,BECKETT>Well, did you see the report from the fire investigator?

507
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,640
<27-18,BECKETT>没  但是...
<27-18,BECKETT>No, but...

508
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,370
<27-19,CASTLE>不是吧  蓄意烧掉仓库
<27-19,CASTLE>Really, a warehouse fire?

509
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,610
<27-19,CASTLE>为了区区几份文件也太大动干戈了吧
<27-19,CASTLE>Seems an awful lot of trouble just for a couple of files.

510
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,050
<27-20,BECKETT>比起他们之前所作所为  这也算不了什么
<27-20,BECKETT>That's no more trouble than they've already gone through.

511
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,980
<27-20,BECKETT>我们一定得看看那报告
<27-20,BECKETT>I mean, we have to read that report.

512
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,300
<27-20,BECKETT>但还有一个问题
<27-20,BECKETT>It's just, there's this one problem.

513
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
<27-21,CASTLE>什么
<27-21,CASTLE>What?

514
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,300
<27-22,BECKETT>盖茨都把你轰走了  你还怎么帮忙啊
<27-22,BECKETT>How are you gonna help if Gates kicked you out?

515
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,090
<27-23,CASTLE>我之所以任由她轰我走
<27-23,CASTLE>I only let her kick me out

516
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,110
<27-23,CASTLE>是因为我没必要留下来
<27-23,CASTLE>because there was no reason to stay.

517
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,910
<27-25,CASTLE>她会把我招回去的
<27-25,CASTLE>She'll take me back.

518
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,950
<27-25,CASTLE>我要卡塞尔回局里
<27-25,CASTLE>And I want Castle back at the precinct.

519
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,930
<28-1,GATES>是的  市长先生
<28-1,GATES>Yes, Mr. Mayor.

520
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,260
<28-1,GATES>是的  先生  我明白
<28-1,GATES>Yes, Sir. I understand.

521
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,200
<28-1,GATES>就今天  没得商量
<28-1,GATES>Today. No more discussion.

522
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,390
<28-2,GATES>好吧  我...
<28-2,GATES>Okay. I--

523
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,470
<28-2,GATES>卡塞尔先生  越级搞小动作
<28-2,GATES>You think you're clever, Mr. Castle,

524
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,230
<28-2,GATES>还觉得自己很聪明  是吗
<28-2,GATES>going around my back like that?

525
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,760
<28-2,GATES>不过我告诉你
<28-2,GATES>Well, let me tell you the score,

526
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,440
<28-2,GATES>不管你的朋友有多么位高权重
<28-2,GATES>I don't care how powerful your friends are,

527
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,720
<28-2,GATES>你要是在我眼皮底下把事情搞砸了
<28-2,GATES>you screw up at all on my watch,

528
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,490
<28-2,GATES>我会以法律的最大限度去起诉你
<28-2,GATES>and I'll prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.

529
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,690
<28-3,CASTLE>-你明白了吗  -是的  女士
<28-3,CASTLE>- You understand me? - Yes, ma'am.

530
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,170
<28-4,GATES>-长官  -长官
<28-4,GATES>- Sir. - Sir.

531
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,700
<28-6,GATES>立马从我办公室消失
<28-6,GATES>Now get out of my office.

532
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,330
<28-7,GATES>探长
<28-7,GATES>Detective.

533
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,170
<28-8,BECKETT>在
<28-8,BECKETT>Yes.

534
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,360
<28-8,BECKETT>如果你
<28-8,BECKETT>You...

535
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,270
<28-9,GATES>或刚才那位老兄
<28-9,GATES>or that pal there

536
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,980
<28-9,GATES>再让我下不了台
<28-9,GATES>embarrass me like that again,

537
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,570
<28-9,GATES>我会灭了你们
<28-9,GATES>I will bury you.

538
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,740
<28-9,GATES>遵命  长官
<28-9,GATES>Yes, sir.

539
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,550
<28-10,BECKETT>还有件事
<28-10,BECKETT>Now, um,

540
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,660
<28-10,BECKETT>如果您不介意
<28-10,BECKETT>if you don't mind...

541
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,920
<28-10,BECKETT>我希望能把配枪取回
<28-10,BECKETT>I'd like my gun back.

542
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,880
<29-1,BECKETT>利用市长让她丢脸
<29-1,BECKETT>Showing her up with the Mayor?

543
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,280
<29-1,BECKETT>你这样简直就是捅蜂窝啊
<29-1,BECKETT>You might as well have beaten a beehive with a bat.

544
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,330
<29-2,CASTLE>但事情搞定了  不是吗
<29-2,CASTLE>Well, it worked, didn't it?

545
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,480
<29-2,CASTLE>再说  看到她的脸
<29-2,CASTLE>Besides, it sure was great

546
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,240
<29-2,CASTLE>扭曲成那样  很给力啊
<29-2,CASTLE>seeing her face twitch like that.

547
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,880
<29-3,BECKETT>索亚·吉伯特
<29-3,BECKETT>Sonya Gilbert?

548
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,060
<29-4,RYAN>是的  枪支  毒品  爱情变质
<29-4,RYAN>Yep. Guns, drugs, and love gone wrong.

549
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,260
<29-5,BECKETT>她的男朋友哪儿去了
<29-5,BECKETT>Where are you with the boyfriend?

550
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,860
<29-6,RYAN>已经发了全面通缉  但他还没回过家
<29-6,RYAN>APB's out, but he hasn't been home,

551
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,720
<29-6,RYAN>他的乐队成员也都不知道他在哪儿
<29-6,RYAN>and none of his bandmates know where he is.

552
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,650
<29-7,CASTLE>他的动机是什么
<29-7,CASTLE>What was his motive?

553
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,050
<29-8,RYAN>再普通不过  他和被害人起了争执
<29-8,RYAN>The usual. He and the vic had been fighting.

554
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,280
<29-8,RYAN>他爱得发狂  她却激情不再
<29-8,RYAN>He was in love, she wanted out.

556
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,670
<30-1,ESPOSITO>我把火灾报告从记录里调了出来
<30-1,ESPOSITO>I pulled the report on the fire from records.

557
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,990
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你看日期
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Check the date.

558
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,170
<30-2,BECKETT>仓库是在我妈妈被谋杀三周后被烧毁的
<30-2,BECKETT>That warehouse burned down three weeks after my mom's murder.

559
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,420
<30-3,RYAN>那一定不是巧合
<30-3,RYAN>That can't be a coincidence.

560
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,250
<30-4,CASTLE>有人在毁灭证据
<30-4,CASTLE>Someone was destroying evidence.

561
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,000
<30-4,CASTLE>那些能查出谁杀害了你妈妈的证据
<30-4,CASTLE>Evidence that could lead to your mom's killers.

562
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,360
<30-5,BECKETT>但调查员把它划为意外事故
<30-5,BECKETT>But the investigator ruled it an accident.

563
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,290
<30-6,ESPOSITO>而且没有任何迹象表明是纵火
<30-6,ESPOSITO>And there's nothing in there to suggest arson.

564
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,600
<30-7,RYAN>也许有人篡改了报告
<30-7,RYAN>Maybe someone altered it.

565
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,770
<30-8,CASTLE>有个简单的办法能查出真相
<30-8,CASTLE>There's an easy way to find out.

566
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,230
<30-8,CASTLE>去问问那个写报告的罗德·豪斯德就行了
<30-8,CASTLE>Just ask the man who wrote the report, Rod Halstead.

567
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,530
<30-9,BECKETT>除非他们把他也杀了
<30-9,BECKETT>Unless they got to him, too.

568
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,590
<30-10,ESPOSITO>不  他活着  还在职呢
<30-10,ESPOSITO>No. He's alive and on the job.

569
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,720
<30-10,ESPOSITO>你俩现在快去找他  查出有料线索
<30-10,ESPOSITO>Now get your ass over there and find something

570
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,100
<30-10,ESPOSITO>好让我们重开案件
<30-10,ESPOSITO>we can use to reopen the investigation.

571
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,910
<30-11,GATES>莱恩  埃斯波西托
<30-11,GATES>Ryan! Esposito!

572
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,550
<30-12,ESPOSITO>在  我俩只是...
<30-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we were just...

573
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,740
<30-12,ESPOSITO>是啊  我俩只是倒杯水喝
<30-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we were just getting a drink of water.

574
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,480
<30-12,ESPOSITO>是啊  饮水机是不是坏了  我只是...
<30-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, is that thing broken? I just--

575
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:32,860
<30-13,GATES>准备出动
<30-13,GATES>Saddle up.

576
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,700
<30-13,GATES>全面通缉有消息了
<30-13,GATES>We just got a hit on the APB.

577
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,630
<30-13,GATES>一个巡警认出了索亚·吉伯特的男友
<30-13,GATES>A beat cop IDed Sonya Gilbert's boyfriend.

578
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,470
<30-13,GATES>他刚刚进入下东区
<30-13,GATES>Heading into the band's rehearsal garage

579
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,210
<30-13,GATES>乐队排练的车库  你也要去  贝克特
<30-13,GATES>on the lower east side. You, too, Beckett!

580
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,280
<30-14,BECKETT>把这藏好
<30-14,BECKETT>Hide this.

581
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,190
<31-1,ESPOSITO>你行吗
<31-1,ESPOSITO>Hey, you ready for this?

582
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,380
<31-2,BECKETT>你说笑呢吧
<31-2,BECKETT>You're kidding, right?

583
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,060
<31-3,ESPOSITO>好吧  但我们打前锋
<31-3,ESPOSITO>Okay. But we got point.

584
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,080
<31-3,ESPOSITO>走吧
<31-3,ESPOSITO>Let's go.

585
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,330
<31-3,ESPOSITO>你来这儿是脑袋进水了吗  戴尔

<37-5,BECKETT>Yeah, and send it to my apartment.

690
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,410
<37-5,BECKETT>我可不想被盖茨发现
<37-5,BECKETT>I don't need Gates looking over my shoulder.

691
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,240
<38-1,ESPOSITO>懂了
<38-1,ESPOSITO>You got it.

692
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,560
<38-2,ESPOSITO>贝克特打来的
<38-2,ESPOSITO>That was Beckett.

693
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,310
<38-3,RYAN>豪斯德那边查得如何
<38-3,RYAN>How'd it go with Halstead?

694
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,150
<38-4,ESPOSITO>她要我拿些资料给她  达成协议了吗
<38-4,ESPOSITO>She wants to pull some files. He cut a deal yet?

695
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,140
<38-5,RYAN>没呢
<38-5,RYAN>Nope.

696
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,930
<38-6,RYAN>知道我哪里想不通吗
<38-6,RYAN>You know what I don't get?

697
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,820
<38-7,ESPOSITO>什么
<38-7,ESPOSITO>What's that?

698
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,280
<38-8,RYAN>我们掌握的死亡时间是凌晨3点
<38-8,RYAN>Our time of death is around 3:00 a.m.

699
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,870
<38-8,RYAN>如果戴尔是凶手的话
<38-8,RYAN>Now if Dale's our shooter,

700
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,740
<38-8,RYAN>为什么他杀死索亚之后
<38-8,RYAN>why'd he hang around for another six hours

701
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,650
<38-8,RYAN>还要再逗留6个小时呢
<38-8,RYAN>after he shot Sonya?

702
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,930
<38-9,ESPOSITO>喜欢抱抱咯
<38-9,ESPOSITO>Likes to cuddle.

703
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,070
<38-9,ESPOSITO>我也不知道  杀掉自己的女友
<38-9,ESPOSITO>I don't know. It's not like blowing away your girlfriend

704
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,720
<38-9,ESPOSITO>又不是正常的行为
<38-9,ESPOSITO>is a rational act to begin with.

705
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,110
<38-9,ESPOSITO>为什么这么问
<38-9,ESPOSITO>Why?

706
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,520
<38-10,RYAN>如果我有疑问  陪审团也会有
<38-10,RYAN>If I'm asking the question, the jury's gonna be, too.

707
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,930
<39-1,CASTLE>这个家伙因为英勇而受过多次表彰
<39-1,CASTLE>This guy's got multiple citations for valor,

708
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,260
<39-1,CASTLE>还受到过市长的赞赏
<39-1,CASTLE>commendations from the Mayor,

709
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,990
<39-1,CASTLE>他多次将市民从着火的大楼中救出
<39-1,CASTLE>he's literally saved dozens of people from burning buildings.

710
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,380
<39-1,CASTLE>很难相信这个人有污点
<39-1,CASTLE>It's hard to believe this guy's dirty.

711
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,320
<39-2,BECKETT>但我们之前有过这样的惊诧
<39-2,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, we've been surprised before.

712
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,610
<39-2,BECKETT>好吧
<39-2,BECKETT>Okay.

713
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,620
<39-3,CASTLE>他和这案子中的其他人有过交集吗
<39-3,CASTLE>Does he intersect with anyone else in the case--

714
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,280
<39-3,CASTLE>蒙哥马利  拉格兰  麦卡利斯特
<39-3,CASTLE>un, Montgomery, Raglan, McCallister?

715
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,920
<39-4,BECKETT>没有  档案里没有提及
<39-4,BECKETT>No, there's nothing in the files.

716
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,570
<39-4,BECKETT>也许他们是私下认识
<39-4,BECKETT>Might have known them socially.

717
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,780
<39-5,CASTLE>但我们仔仔细细地查过了他们的生活
<39-5,CASTLE>But we've been over their lives with a fine-tooth comb.

718
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,960
<39-5,CASTLE>他一次也没出现过
<39-5,CASTLE>He's never come up once.

719
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,930
<39-6,BECKETT>好吧  也许他是个利用对象
<39-6,BECKETT>Okay, so maybe he was a target of opportunity.

720
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,150
<39-6,BECKETT>他可能急需用钱
<39-6,BECKETT>He might have needed the money.

721
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,270
<39-7,CASTLE>他的财务记录显示他没有这种状况
<39-7,CASTLE>Nothing in his financial records to indicate any problems,

722
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,250
<39-8,BECKETT>而考虑到他的记录  他
<39-8,BECKETT>and given his record, he's...

723
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,350
<39-8,BECKETT>考虑到他的记录  怎么了
<39-8,BECKETT>Given his record, what?

724
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,410
<39-9,CASTLE>其实我想说  如果他不是我们要找的人呢
<39-9,CASTLE>I'm just saying, what if he's not our guy?

725
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,630
<39-9,CASTLE>如果那场火灾是意外呢
<39-9,CASTLE>What if the fire was an accident?

726
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,780
<39-10,BECKETT>那不是一场意外  我知道肯定不是
<39-10,BECKETT>It wasn't an accident. I know it wasn't an accident.

727
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,940
<39-11,CASTLE>-你没法如此确定  -我很确定
<39-11,CASTLE>- You can't know that. - I can,

728
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,700
<39-12,BECKETT>因为如果这是场意外
<39-12,BECKETT>because if this was an accident,

729
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,020
<39-12,BECKETT>那我又将毫无头绪
<39-12,BECKETT>then I've got nowhere to start.

730
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,060
<39-12,BECKETT>若是场意外  就什么线索都没有了
<39-12,BECKETT>If this was an accident, then I've got nothing.

731
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,450
<39-12,BECKETT>狙击我的那人消失了
<39-12,BECKETT>The guy who shot me is gone.

732
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,930
<39-12,BECKETT>迪克·库南  死了
<39-12,BECKETT>Dick Coonan--gone.

733
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,080
<39-12,BECKETT>哈尔·洛克伍德  死了
<39-12,BECKETT>Hal Lockwood--gone.

734
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,300
<39-12,BECKETT>蒙哥马利  也死了
<39-12,BECKETT>Montgomery--gone.

735
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,770
<39-12,BECKETT>我的母亲  所有人都不在了  卡塞尔
<39-12,BECKETT>My mom-- everybody is gone, Castle.

737
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,730
<40-1,ALEXIS>你今天没回来吃晚饭
<40-1,ALEXIS>Missed you for dinner tonight.

738
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,250
<40-2,CASTLE>我知道  不好意思  我在工作
<40-2,CASTLE>Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I was working.

739
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,540
<40-3,ALEXIS>你和贝克特在一起
<40-3,ALEXIS>You were with Beckett.

740
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,560
<40-4,CASTLE>是的
<40-4,CASTLE>Yeah.

741
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,110
<40-5,ALEXIS>你不是说不再回去了吗
<40-5,ALEXIS>I thought you said you weren't going back.

742
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,560
<40-6,CASTLE>是啊
<40-6,CASTLE>I'm not.

743
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,470
<40-6,CASTLE>听着  我不会回去  只办这个案子
<40-6,CASTLE>Look, I'm not. It's just this one case.

744
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,410
<40-7,ALEXIS>随你  冰箱里有剩饭
<40-7,ALEXIS>Yeah, well, there's leftovers in the fridge.

745
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,990
<40-8,CASTLE>你好
<40-8,CASTLE>Hello.

746
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,350
<40-9,MYSTERY MAN>-卡塞尔先生吗  -是的
<40-9,MYSTERY MAN>- Mr. Castle. - Yeah.

747
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,660
<40-10,CASTLE>我是罗伊·蒙哥马利的朋友
<40-10,CASTLE>I'm a friend of Roy Montgomery's.

748
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,030
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>我打电话来是为了贝克特探长
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>I'm calling about Detective Beckett.

749
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,770
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>我们要谈一谈
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>We need to talk.

750
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,160
<41-1,MARTHA>你知道他是谁吗
<41-1,MARTHA>Do you have any idea who he was?

751
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,300
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>只知道他是蒙哥马利的朋友
<40-11,MYSTERY MAN>Just that he's a friend of Montgomery's,

752
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,240
<41-2,CASTLE>说蒙哥马利救了他一命
<41-2,CASTLE>That he owed Montgomery his life.

753
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,760
<41-2,CASTLE>还说蒙哥马利把一些文件寄给了他
<41-2,CASTLE>He said Montgomery sent him some files--

754
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,070
<41-2,CASTLE>那些文件一旦泄漏出去
<41-2,CASTLE>files that, if they ever got out,

755
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,890
<41-2,CASTLE>能把一批大人物拉下马
<41-2,CASTLE>could hurt some very powerful people.

756
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,980
<41-2,CASTLE>他们以这些文件作为威胁
<41-2,CASTLE>They were using those files as a threat

757
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,380
<41-2,CASTLE>防止蒙哥马利的家人受到伤害
<41-2,CASTLE>to keep Montgomery's family from every being harmed.

758
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,260
<41-2,CASTLE>保证贝克特的安全也是协议的一部分
<41-2,CASTLE>Beckett's safety was also part of the deal.

759
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,040
<41-3,MARTHA>但他们还是对她下手了啊
<41-3,MARTHA>But they went after her anyway.

760
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,300
<41-4,CASTLE>他是在她被枪击后才收到文件的
<41-4,CASTLE>He didn't get the files until after she was shot.

761
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,470
<41-4,CASTLE>他说她现在是安全的
<41-4,CASTLE>He says she's safe now...

762
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,890
<41-4,CASTLE>不过有个条件
<41-4,CASTLE>on one condition.

763
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,980
<41-4,CASTLE>她不再碰这个案子
<41-4,CASTLE>She can't go near the case.

764
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,730
<41-4,CASTLE>否则他也没法保证她的安全
<41-4,CASTLE>If she does, he can't guarantee her safety.

765
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,230
<41-4,CASTLE>若她穷追不舍  他们会杀了她
<41-4,CASTLE>If she digs, they will kill her.

766
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,000
<41-5,MARTHA>这个人  你相信他吗
<41-5,MARTHA>And this man, you believe him?

767
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,650
<41-7,MARTHA>-我相信  -那你得告诉她
<41-7,MARTHA>- I do. - Then you have to tell her.

768
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,940
<41-8,CASTLE>若我坦白  她肯定会不顾一切
<41-8,CASTLE>If I do that, she'll put on blinders

769
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,450
<41-8,CASTLE>奋不顾身地去一探究竟
<41-8,CASTLE>and run out into the line of fire.

770
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,430
<41-8,CASTLE>我不能让她这么干
<41-8,CASTLE>I can't let that happen.

771
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,320
<41-9,MARTHA>你没有办法改变她  理查德
<41-9,MARTHA>You are not going to change her, Richard.

772
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,510
<41-9,MARTHA>她会继续研究这个案子
<41-9,MARTHA>She's gonna keep going out there

773
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,020
<41-9,MARTHA>试图找出真相
<41-9,MARTHA>and she's gonna keep digging.

774
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,190
<41-10,CASTLE>除非我说服她
<41-10,CASTLE>Not if stop her.

775
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,210
<41-10,CASTLE>她会听我的
<41-10,CASTLE>She'll listen to me.

776
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,070
<41-10,CASTLE>我可以转移她的注意力
<41-10,CASTLE>I can steer her away.

777
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,330
<41-11,MARTHA>你能撑多久
<41-11,MARTHA>For how long?

778
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,960
<41-12,CASTLE>我不会再让她陷入险境
<41-12,CASTLE>I'm not gonna lose her again.

779
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,090
<41-13,ALEXIS>我猜不仅仅是这个案子  是吧
<41-13,ALEXIS>So I guess it's not just for this case, is it?

780
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,300
<41-14,CASTLE>你听到了多少
<41-14,CASTLE>How much did you hear?

781
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,830
<41-15,ALEXIS>该听的都听了
<41-15,ALEXIS>Enough.

782
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,660
<41-16,CASTLE>你一个字都不能透露出去
<41-16,CASTLE>Look, it's really important you don't say anything.

783
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,030
<41-16,CASTLE>知道吗  尤其不能告诉贝克特
<41-16,CASTLE>All right? Especially to Beckett.

784
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,410
<41-17,ALEXIS>你的态度好像是一切都为了她
<41-17,ALEXIS>You act like this is all about her,

785
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,360
<41-17,ALEXIS>但你就在她旁边
<41-17,ALEXIS>but you were standing right next to her.

786
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,720
<41-17,ALEXIS>被击中的可能是你  老天  也可能是我
<41-17,ALEXIS>You could've been shot. Hell, I could've been shot.

787
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,880
<41-18,CASTLE>所以我才要这么做  让他们远离我们
<41-18,CASTLE>That's why I have to do this, to make sure they stay away.

788
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,010
<41-18,CASTLE>真的吗
<41-18,CASTLE>Yeah?

789
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,680
<41-19,ALEXIS>成熟点吧  老爸
<41-19,ALEXIS>You need to grow up, Dad.

790
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,200
<41-19,ALEXIS>你是作家  不是警察
<41-19,ALEXIS>You're a writer, not a cop.

791
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,620
<41-19,ALEXIS>别再假扮了
<41-19,ALEXIS>Stop pretending.

792
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,520
<41-19,ALEXIS>谢谢
<41-19,ALEXIS>Thanks.

793
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,710
<42-1,BECKETT>你还记得
<42-1,BECKETT>Do you remember

794
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,330
<42-2,CASTLE>我第一次提起你母亲的案子时
<42-2,CASTLE>what you told me the first time

795
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,900
<42-2,CASTLE>你对我说了什么吗
<42-2,CASTLE>I brought up your mother's case?

796
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,480
<42-2,CASTLE>说你一旦开始  就停不下来
<42-2,CASTLE>That if you got started again, you wouldn't stop.

797
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,850
<42-2,CASTLE>说这个案子可能会毁了你
<42-2,CASTLE>You said it would probably destroy you.

798
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,030
<42-3,BECKETT>是啊  可我当时没有任何线索
<42-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I didn't have any leads then.

799
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,490
<42-4,CASTLE>我们现在也没有
<42-4,CASTLE>We don't have any now.

800
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,310
<42-5,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔
<42-5,BECKETT>Look, Castle,

801
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,530
<42-5,BECKETT>我昨晚有些太激动了
<42-5,BECKETT>I got a little emotional last night.

802
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,650
<42-5,BECKETT>我...
<42-5,BECKETT>I'm...

803
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,320
<42-5,BECKETT>我没事
<42-5,BECKETT>I'm fine.

804
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,620
<42-6,CASTLE>不  你不好
<42-6,CASTLE>No, you're not.

805
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,560
<42-6,CASTLE>你自己也清楚这一点
<42-6,CASTLE>And you know you're not.

806
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,210
<42-6,CASTLE>你回警局三天
<42-6,CASTLE>You've been back here three days.

807
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,580
<42-6,CASTLE>就已经失控了
<42-6,CASTLE>You're already in a freefall.

808
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,780
<42-6,CASTLE>我不是让你彻底放手
<42-6,CASTLE>I'm not telling you to walk away.

809
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,740
<42-6,CASTLE>我是说...慢慢来
<42-6,CASTLE>I'm just saying... give it time.

810
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,540
<42-6,CASTLE>直到你冷静下来  恢复过来
<42-6,CASTLE>You know, just until you get your bearings again.

811
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,060
<42-7,BECKETT>有人想要杀我
<42-7,BECKETT>How am I supposed to get my bearings

812
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,900
<42-7,BECKETT>你让我怎么冷静
<42-7,BECKETT>when someone out there wants me dead?

813
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:52,550
<42-8,CASTLE>使自己不被他们困扰
<42-8,CASTLE>By not letting them rob you of your life.

814
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,840
<42-8,CASTLE>我向你保证
<42-8,CASTLE>I promise you,

815
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,320
<42-8,CASTLE>会有水落石出的一天
<42-8,CASTLE>we will figure this out.

816
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,440
<42-8,CASTLE>我们会逮到他们
<42-8,CASTLE>We're gonna find them

817
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,050
<42-8,CASTLE>并让他们付出应有的代价
<42-8,CASTLE>and we're gonna make them pay.

818
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,240
<42-8,CASTLE>但不是今日
<42-8,CASTLE>Just not today.

819
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,060
<42-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  若放下这个案子  我会很迷茫
<42-9,BECKETT>Castle, if I don't do this, I don't know who I am.

820
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,170
<42-10,CASTLE>你还是以前的你
<42-10,CASTLE>You're who you always were.

821
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,310
<42-10,CASTLE>你尊重被害人
<42-10,CASTLE>You're the one who honors the victims.

822
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,770
<42-10,CASTLE>你能为索亚的家人
<42-10,CASTLE>You're the one who can bring

823
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,240
<42-10,CASTLE>抚平心灵的伤痛
<42-10,CASTLE>Sonya's family some peace.

824
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,380
<42-11,BECKETT>有何发现
<42-11,BECKETT>Anything?

825
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,680
<42-12,RYAN>地方检察官说  本来铁板订钉的案子
<42-12,RYAN>According to the D.A., we just turned a slam-dunk case

826
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:37,940
<42-12,RYAN>现在没戏了
<42-12,RYAN>into a hail mary.

827
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,700
<42-13,ESPOSITO>特警小莱恩不停调查
<42-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, super cop over here had to keep digging

828
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,040
<42-13,ESPOSITO>-然后...  -然后什么
<42-13,ESPOSITO>- so, you know... - And?

829
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:45,760
<42-15,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在喝伏特加的杯子里
<42-15,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. found trace residual of, uh, barbiturates

831
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,760
<42-15,ESPOSITO>发现了巴比妥类药物
<42-15,ESPOSITO>in the vodka glasses,

832
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,500
<42-15,ESPOSITO>就是说戴尔和索亚在回到公寓后
<42-15,ESPOSITO>which means Dale and Sonya were both roofied

833
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,200
<42-15,ESPOSITO>都被灌了迷药
<42-15,ESPOSITO>when they got back to the apartment.

834
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,330
<42-16,CASTLE>但还有可能是男友干的  对吧
<42-16,CASTLE>Well, it still could have been the boyfriend, right?

835
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,100
<42-16,CASTLE>他本来想给她下药
<42-16,CASTLE>I mean, he could've meant to roofie her,

836
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,930
<42-16,CASTLE>却把自己也撂倒了  这么说也解释不了这案子
<42-16,CASTLE>but roofied them both instead, not that that makes any sense.

837
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,390
<42-17,RYAN>但还能怎么解释呢
<42-17,RYAN>But what other explanation is there?

838
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,340
<42-17,RYAN>公寓里没有其他人
<42-17,RYAN>There was no one else in the apartment,

839
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,580
<42-17,RYAN>而且根据安保系统记录
<42-17,RYAN>and according to the security system,

840
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,590
<42-17,RYAN>在晚上十点到早上九点间
<42-17,RYAN>no one else entered or left the apartment

841
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,660
<42-17,RYAN>公寓没有人进出
<42-17,RYAN>between 10:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.

842
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,820
<42-18,ESPOSITO>就是说  死者男友肯定是凶手
<42-18,ESPOSITO>Which means the boyfriend has to be the shooter.

843
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,910
<42-19,BECKETT>除非
<42-19,BECKETT>Unless...

844
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,400
<42-19,BECKETT>除非什么
<42-19,BECKETT>Unless what?

845
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,830
<42-20,BECKETT>除非凶手一直都躲在屋里
<42-20,BECKETT>The killer was in the apartment the whole time.

846
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,250
<43-1,CASTLE>他们回家的时候
<43-1,CASTLE>When they came home,

847
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,250
<43-1,CASTLE>还以为家里没人
<43-1,CASTLE>they thought they were alone.

848
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,280
<43-2,BECKETT>与此同时  当他们不在屋里的时候
<43-2,BECKETT>Meanwhile, while they're out of the room,

849
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,280
<43-2,BECKETT>凶手就溜出来  在他们的酒里下药
<43-2,BECKETT>the killer...slips out, spikes their drinks,

850
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,440
<43-2,BECKETT>然后再偷偷溜回到他的藏身之地
<43-2,BECKETT>and then slips back into his hiding place, where he...

851
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,280
<43-3,CASTLE>凶手也可能是个女人
<43-3,CASTLE>Or she...

852
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,470
<43-4,BECKETT>静静地等着药效发作
<43-4,BECKETT>waits for them to pass out.

853
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,670
<43-5,ESPOSITO>真是守株待兔呀
<43-5,ESPOSITO>Literally lying in wait.

854
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
<43-6,RYAN>真吓人
<43-6,RYAN>That's creepy.

855
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,290
<43-7,BECKETT>几个小时以后
<43-7,BECKETT>And then a couple of hours later,

856
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,780
<43-7,BECKETT>他再溜出来  抓了个枕头
<43-7,BECKETT>he slips out again, grabs the pillow,

857
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,890
<43-7,BECKETT>-射杀被害人  然后他  -或是她
<43-7,BECKETT>- and bam, and then he... - Or she...

858
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,690
<43-9,BECKETT>抹掉了枪上指纹  再把枪放到戴尔的手里
<43-9,BECKETT>wipes the gun clean and puts it into Dale's hand.

859
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,420
<43-10,CASTLE>他醒来后  慌了神  于是就跑了
<43-10,CASTLE>He wakes up, he panics, he runs.

860
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,580
<43-10,CASTLE>与此同时  我们的凶手
<43-10,CASTLE>All the while, our killer...

861
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,800
<43-10,CASTLE>不慌不忙地
<43-10,CASTLE>bides his time,

862
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,420
<43-10,CASTLE>一直等到有人发现了尸体
<43-10,CASTLE>waiting until the body is discovered

863
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,170
<43-10,CASTLE>-他才开始  -或是她
<43-10,CASTLE>- before he makes his... - Or her...

864
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,920
<43-12,CASTLE>逃跑  先生们  帮我一下好吗
<43-12,CASTLE>escape. Gentlemen, would you?

865
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,190
<43-13,CASTLE>一  二  三
<43-13,CASTLE>One, two, three.

866
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,930
<43-14,CASTLE>床垫底部的血迹
<43-14,CASTLE>The bloodstain on the bottom of the mattress

867
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,410
<43-14,CASTLE>一直滴到了地毯上
<43-14,CASTLE>dripped down onto the carpet.

868
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,410
<43-14,CASTLE>可是中间却没有血迹滴落的痕迹
<43-14,CASTLE>There's no drip marks in the middle.

869
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,860
<43-15,CASTLE>借你的手电用一下好吗
<43-15,CASTLE>Your light?

870
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,830
<43-16,RYAN>有指纹
<43-16,RYAN>Fingerprints.

871
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,340
<43-17,CASTLE>有人在这儿待过
<43-17,CASTLE>Someone was here.

872
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,460
<43-18,BECKETT>看来这就是凶手的藏身之地
<43-18,BECKETT>Looks like they found a killer hiding place.

873
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,980
<44-1,ESPOSITO>怎么会有人在床底下躲几个小时
<44-1,ESPOSITO>Hiding under a bed for hours

874
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,790
<44-1,ESPOSITO>看着自己射杀的女孩因流血过多而死
<44-1,ESPOSITO>while the girl you just shot bleeds out?

875
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,960
<44-1,ESPOSITO>穷凶极恶之徒才能干得出这种事
<44-1,ESPOSITO>You gotta be one sick bastard to do something like that.

876
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,100
<44-2,CASTLE>他也挺聪明的
<44-2,CASTLE>It's actually pretty clever.

877
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,060
<44-2,CASTLE>杀了人
<44-2,CASTLE>You commit a murder

878
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,080
<44-2,CASTLE>还嫁祸给一个无辜的人
<44-2,CASTLE>and frame an innocent man all at the same time.

879
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,120
<44-3,BECKETT>自己却逃脱法律制裁
<44-3,BECKETT>And then you get away with it

880
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,760
<44-3,BECKETT>因为警察以为自己已经抓到了凶手
<44-3,BECKETT>because the police already think they have their killer

881
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,180
<44-3,BECKETT>所以就没人再去注意他了
<44-3,BECKETT>and no one's looking for you.

882
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,730
<44-4,RYAN>米奇·扬希  他是戴尔的乐队成员
<44-4,RYAN>Mitch Yancey. That's Dale's bandmate.

883
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,060
<44-5,BECKETT>咱们走
<44-5,BECKETT>Let's go.

884
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,700
<44-5,BECKETT>莱恩
<44-5,BECKETT>Ryan.

885
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,780
<44-5,BECKETT>去那边
<44-5,BECKETT>Let's go.

886
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,070
<45-2,CASTLE>你没事吧
<45-2,CASTLE>You okay?

887
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,580
<45-3,BECKETT>没事
<45-3,BECKETT>Yeah.

888
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,820
<45-4,CASTLE>我不认为
<45-4,CASTLE>I don't even think --

889
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,050
<45-5,MITCH>放下枪
<45-5,MITCH>Put your gun down!

890
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,040
<45-5,MITCH>凯特
<45-5,MITCH>Kate!

891
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,670
<45-6,MITCH>把枪放下
<45-6,MITCH>I said put it down!

892
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,100
<45-6,MITCH>你只需要
<45-6,MITCH>Just...

893
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,960
<45-6,MITCH>放我走就行  我只有这点要求
<45-6,MITCH>let me walk outta here, okay? That's all I want.

894
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,680
<45-6,MITCH>不许  不许
<45-6,MITCH>Don't...don't...

895
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,560
<45-7,BECKETT>不许动  米奇
<45-7,BECKETT>Don't move, Mitch!

896
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,100
<45-8,MITCH>我会开枪的  我发誓
<45-8,MITCH>I'll shoot you. I swear.

897
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,400
<45-9,CASTLE>别慌  凯特
<45-9,CASTLE>Take it easy, Kate.

898
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,680
<45-10,MITCH>你放我走吧
<45-10,MITCH>I just need you to let me go.

899
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,320
<45-11,CASTLE>别慌  你没问题的
<45-11,CASTLE>Take it easy. You've got this.

900
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,350
<45-11,CASTLE>你行的
<45-11,CASTLE>You've got this.

901
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,280
<45-12,MITCH>放下枪然后退后  退后
<45-12,MITCH>Put it down and stay back. Stay back.

902
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,670
<45-13,BECKETT>你别逼我  米奇
<45-13,BECKETT>You don't want to do this, Mitch...

903
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,380
<45-13,BECKETT>别逼我开枪
<45-13,BECKETT>because I will have to put you down.

904
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,120
<45-13,BECKETT>你明白吗
<45-13,BECKETT>Do you understand?

905
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,130
<45-14,BECKETT>马上把枪放下
<45-14,BECKETT>Put that gun down, now.

906
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,670
<45-15,BECKETT>转过身去  把手放在头上
<45-15,BECKETT>Turn around. Hands behind your head.

907
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,550
<45-16,BECKETT>米奇·扬希  你被捕了
<45-16,BECKETT>Mitch Yancey, you're under arrest.

908
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,450
<46-1,RYAN>原来米奇
<46-1,RYAN>Turns out Mitch

909
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,400
<46-1,RYAN>已经跟索亚秘密交往了一年
<46-1,RYAN>had been seeing Sonya secretly for a year,

910
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,000
<46-1,RYAN>与此同时索亚还是戴尔的女朋友
<46-1,RYAN>all the time she was with Dale.

911
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,550
<46-2,CASTLE>米奇坚持要她离开戴尔
<46-2,CASTLE>Mitch insisted that she leave Dale,

912
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,270
<46-2,CASTLE>可索亚却离开了他
<46-2,CASTLE>but instead, she broke it off with him.

913
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,630
<46-2,CASTLE>于是米奇就想出这么一招来干掉他们两个
<46-2,CASTLE>So this was Mitch's plan to take care of them both.

914
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,160
<46-3,RYAN>他知道索亚的安保密码
<46-3,RYAN>He knew Sonya's security code,

915
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,570
<46-3,RYAN>但是为了嫁祸给戴尔  他知道他不能
<46-3,RYAN>but to frame Dale, he knew that the system couldn't record

916
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,720
<46-3,RYAN>让系统记录下谋杀发生的时间区内
<46-3,RYAN>anyone else entering or exiting the apartment

917
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,050
<46-3,RYAN>有人进出公寓
<46-3,RYAN>around the time of the murder.

918
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,220
<46-3,RYAN>于是他用之前偷来的钥匙
<46-3,RYAN>So he used a key that he'd stolen to slip in

919
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,920
<46-3,RYAN>在那天早些时候潜入公寓
<46-3,RYAN>hours earlier in the day.

920
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,110
<46-4,GATES>好吧  把索亚的男朋友放了
<46-4,GATES>All right. Cut the boyfriend loose.

921
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,170
<46-4,GATES>我去给媒体做简报  让他们知道凶手认罪了
<46-4,GATES>I'll brief the press and let them know we have a confession.

922
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,820
<46-5,CASTLE>感觉怎么样
<46-5,CASTLE>So how's it feel?

923
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,740
<46-6,BECKETT>还不够
<46-6,BECKETT>It's not enough.

924
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,020
<46-7,BECKETT>但是
<46-7,BECKETT>But it's...

925
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,290
<46-7,BECKETT>就现阶段来讲  够了
<46-7,BECKETT>enough for now.

926
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,360
<46-8,BECKETT>谢谢你当时挺我
<46-8,BECKETT>Thank you for having my back in there.

927
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,020
<46-9,CASTLE>谁让咱俩是搭档呢
<46-9,CASTLE>That's what partners are for.

928
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,630
<46-10,CASTLE>对了  还有
<46-10,CASTLE>Oh, and hey...

929
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,060
<46-10,CASTLE>我们会找到办法的
<46-10,CASTLE>we'll figure it out.

930
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,310
<46-10,CASTLE>你总有一天会卸下心防的
<46-10,CASTLE>That wall inside won't be there forever.

931
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,380
<46-10,CASTLE>你说得没错
<46-10,CASTLE>You're right.

932
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,790
<47-1,CASTLE>我是该成熟点
<47-1,CASTLE>I do need to grow up.

933
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,470
<47-2,CASTLE>正是因为如此  我才努力做着现在的一切
<47-2,CASTLE>And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing.

934
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,320
<47-2,CASTLE>所有这一切都是因我而起
<47-2,CASTLE>Everything that's happened happened because of me.

935
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
<47-2,CASTLE>我需要陪着她一起度过难关
<47-2,CASTLE>And I need to be there for her.

936
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,270
<47-2,CASTLE>这是我欠她的
<47-2,CASTLE>I owe her that.

937
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,210
<47-3,ALEXIS>她让你感到快乐吗
<47-3,ALEXIS>Does she make you happy?

938
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,450
<47-4,CASTLE>是的
<47-4,CASTLE>Yeah, she does.

939
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,860
<47-5,ALEXIS>这就足够了吗
<47-5,ALEXIS>Is it enough?

940
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
<47-6,CASTLE>就目前来说  足够了
<47-6,CASTLE>It's enough for now.

941
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,060
<47-7,ALEXIS>好吧
<47-7,ALEXIS>Okay.

942
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,480
<47-8,CASTLE>好吧
<47-8,CASTLE>Okay.

943
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,030
<47-10,CASTLE>爸
<47-10,CASTLE>Dad.

944
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,620
<47-11,ALEXIS>别熟过头了  好吗
<47-11,ALEXIS>Don't grow up too much, okay?

945
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,100
<47-12,CASTLE>我怎么可能熟过头啊
<47-12,CASTLE>It's me we're talking about.

947
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,860
<48-1,BECKETT>看到我回到这儿  你可能有点惊讶吧
<48-1,BECKETT>You're probably surprised to see me back here.

948
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,410
<48-1,BECKETT>我想大多数警察在通过了心理评估以后
<48-1,BECKETT>I bet most cops never come back

949
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,400
<48-1,BECKETT>都永远不会再回来了
<48-1,BECKETT>after they pass their psych eval.

950
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,140
<48-1,BECKETT>每个人的情况都不同
<48-1,BECKETT>Everyone's different.

951
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,550
<48-3,BURKE>你有什么困扰
<48-3,BURKE>What's on your mind?

952
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,730
<48-4,BECKETT>我都不知道该从哪说起
<48-4,BECKETT>I don't even know where to start.

953
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,280
<48-5,BURKE>那我们就从枪击案开始吧
<48-5,BURKE>Well, why don't we start with the shooting?

954
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,440
<48-5,BURKE>你想起什么来了吗
<48-5,BURKE>Is any of it coming back to you?

955
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,400
<48-6,BECKETT>我之前说我不记得
<48-6,BECKETT>I lied....

956
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,820
<48-6,BECKETT>是骗人的
<48-6,BECKETT>before.

957
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,230
<48-7,BURKE>那你到底记得什么
<48-7,BURKE>What do you remember?

958
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,150
<48-8,BECKETT>我记得当时发生的一切
<48-8,BECKETT>I remember everything.
