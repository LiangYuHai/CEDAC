00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,170
<1-1,JACK SINCLAIR>客厅  晚上九点零三分
<1-1,JACK SINCLAIR>Living room, 9:03 p.m.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,350
<1-1,JACK SINCLAIR>电磁场侦测器接收到前所未有的强烈信号
<1-1,JACK SINCLAIR>EMF level spiking off the chart.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,600
<1-2,JACK>有人吗
<1-2,JACK>Hello?

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,020
<1-2,JACK>有人在那吗
<1-2,JACK>Is anyone there?

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,750
<1-3,JACK>梅夕[仁慈]
<1-3,JACK>Mercy...

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,310
<1-3,JACK>我看见了
<1-3,JACK>I can see it.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,520
<1-3,JACK>梅夕[仁慈]
<1-3,JACK>Mercy...

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,570
<1-4,JACK>不
<1-4,JACK>No!

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,750
<1-4,JACK>不
<1-4,JACK>No!

18
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,890
<1-4,JACK>老爸  你在用我做肉盾
<1-4,JACK>Dad, are you using me as a shield

19
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,500
<2-1,ALEXIS>挡在食人僵尸前面吗
<2-1,ALEXIS>against flesh-eating zombies?

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,160
<2-2,CASTLE>不  不是  我只是想让你有个好点的视野
<2-2,CASTLE>No. No. I just wanted you to have a better view.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,370
<2-2,CASTLE>你去哪  我认为
<2-2,CASTLE>Where are you going? I think--

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,760
<2-3,CASTLE>我真的认为我们还是一起看安全点
<2-3,CASTLE>I really think we're safer in pairs.

23
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,550
<2-4,ALEXIS>抱歉  老爸  你得自己保护自己了
<2-4,ALEXIS>Sorry, dad. You're gonna have to fend for yourself.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,890
<2-4,ALEXIS>我要去和阿什利视频了
<2-4,ALEXIS>I'm skyping with ashley.

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:11,810
<2-4,ALEXIS>什么
<2-4,ALEXIS>What?

26
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,800
<2-5,CASTLE>就这么打断我们的父女赏僵尸时间
<2-5,CASTLE>Right in the middle of father-daughter zombie time?

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,580
<2-5,CASTLE>迟点再聊行不行
<2-5,CASTLE>Can't you do it later?

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,690
<2-6,ALEXIS>他待会就没空了
<2-6,ALEXIS>He's not available later.

29
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,400
<2-6,ALEXIS>他要参加宿舍会议和研讨班
<2-6,ALEXIS>He's got a dorm meeting and then a seminar after that.

30
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,650
<2-6,ALEXIS>我知道他是个忙人
<2-6,ALEXIS>I know he's busy,

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,850
<2-7,CASTLE>你的随和也非常贴心  宝贝
<2-7,CASTLE>and you are very thoughtful to be so accommodating, sweetheart,

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,710
<2-7,CASTLE>但健康的关系建立在互相尊重的基础上
<2-7,CASTLE>but a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,670
<2-7,CASTLE>你总是为他改变原本的行程安排
<2-7,CASTLE>I mean, think about what kind of signal you're sending

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,840
<2-7,CASTLE>对他有求必应  你想想
<2-7,CASTLE>if you're the one always rearranging your schedule

35
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,700
<2-7,CASTLE>如此行为向他发出了怎样的信号
<2-7,CASTLE>at the other one's every beck and call.

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,860
<2-7,CASTLE>只要他一叫你
<2-7,CASTLE>I mean, if you just drop everything...

37
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,760
<2-7,CASTLE>你就抛下手边的事...抱歉
<2-7,CASTLE>the very moment that-- I'm sorry.

38
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,410
<2-8,CASTLE>等等
<2-8,CASTLE>Oh, hang on.

39
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,570
<2-9,CASTLE>贝克特探长
<2-9,CASTLE>Detective Beckett.

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,860
<2-10,CASTLE>马上到
<2-10,CASTLE>I'll be right there.

41
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,020
<3-1,CASTLE>我很担心阿丽克西斯
<3-1,CASTLE>I'm worried about Alexis.

42
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,370
<3-1,CASTLE>我认为没能考入斯坦福影响了
<3-1,CASTLE>I think her not getting into Stanford

43
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,550
<3-1,CASTLE>她在与阿什利的关系中的地位
<3-1,CASTLE>has upset the balance of power in her relationship with Ashley.

44
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,000
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  换了是我就不会担心
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>Oh, Castle, I wouldn't worry about that.

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,740
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>阿丽克西斯是女孩  阿什利是个少年
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>I mean, Alexis is a girl, and Ashley's a teenage boy.

46
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,260
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>我认为她还是占有主导地位的
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>I'd say she still holds most of the power.

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,370
<3-3,CASTLE>"牧鬼人"摄制组在这
<3-3,CASTLE>The "Ghost Wranglers" are here?

48
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,680
<3-3,CASTLE>这就是我迷他们的原因
<3-3,CASTLE>Okay, that's why I love these guys.

49
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,740
<3-3,CASTLE>尸骨未寒
<3-3,CASTLE>Body's not even cold,

50
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,220
<3-3,CASTLE>他们就已经开始追踪鬼魂了
<3-3,CASTLE>they're already tracking down the ghost.

51
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,290
<3-4,BECKETT>你爱看那荒唐的节目怎么
<3-4,BECKETT>Why doesn't it surprise me that you actually watch

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,970
<3-4,BECKETT>一点也没让我觉得惊讶
<3-4,BECKETT>that ridiculous show?

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,550
<3-5,CASTLE>荒唐地好看
<3-5,CASTLE>Ridiculously awesome.

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,970
<3-5,CASTLE>杰克·辛克莱毫无疑问
<3-5,CASTLE>Jack Sinclair is hands down

55
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,220
<3-5,CASTLE>是全美最出色的猎鬼人
<3-5,CASTLE>America's most accomplished ghost hunter.

56
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,310
<3-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<3-6,BECKETT>Um, Castle...

57
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,180
<3-6,BECKETT>杰克·辛克莱就是死者的名字
<3-6,BECKETT>Jack Sinclair is the name of our victim.

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,240
<3-7,CASTLE>猎人反被猎杀
<3-7,CASTLE>And the hunter becomes the hunted.

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,400
<4-1,STEVE FULLER>他在这录制一个关于屋子的特辑
<4-1,STEVE FULLER>He was here doing a special about the house,

60
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,800
<4-1,STEVE FULLER>就是为他的节目
<4-1,STEVE FULLER>you know, for his TV show.

61
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,910
<4-2,CASTLE>为什么选这里
<4-2,CASTLE>Why this place?

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,420
<4-3,STEVE>这地方有点历史
<4-3,STEVE>It has a bit of a history.

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,950
<4-4,BECKETT>你是指超自然的历史
<4-4,BECKETT>You mean, paranormal history?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,400
<4-5,STEVE>探长  我不是说我自己
<4-5,STEVE>Look, detective, I'm not saying

65
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,240
<4-5,STEVE>相信这些东西  好吗
<4-5,STEVE>I believe in that stuff, okay?

66
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,330
<4-5,STEVE>但我拥有麦拉伦老宅超过二十年了
<4-5,STEVE>But I've owned the McClaren House for over 20 years,

67
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,200
<4-5,STEVE>当这个地方出问题的时候
<4-5,STEVE>and when the phone rings about this place,

68
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,170
<4-5,STEVE>基本不会是马桶坏了
<4-5,STEVE>odds are, it's not a busted toilet.

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,520
<4-6,BECKETT>现在有人住在这里吗
<4-6,BECKETT>Anybody live in there now?

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,510
<4-7,STEVE>很久没人住了
<4-7,STEVE>Not for years.

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,660
<4-7,STEVE>租客总是住不长
<4-7,STEVE>It's hard getting tenants to stick around.

72
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,450
<4-7,STEVE>所以当辛克莱联系我的时候
<4-7,STEVE>So when this Sinclair guy called,

73
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,690
<4-7,STEVE>我想管它呢
<4-7,STEVE>I figured, what the hell?

74
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,190
<4-7,STEVE>也许他能除妖降魔啥的
<4-7,STEVE>Maybe he could clear the place up,

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,500
<4-7,STEVE>就能再出租了
<4-7,STEVE>make it rentable.

76
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,360
<4-7,STEVE>但鉴于刚刚发生的事...
<4-7,STEVE>But after what just happened...

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,590
<4-8,CASTLE>刚刚到底发生了什么事
<4-8,CASTLE>Wh-what exactly did just happen?

78
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,700
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>他的喉部被切开  差不多切至两耳根
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>His throat was slit almost from ear to ear.

79
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,510
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>颈静脉  甲状腺动脉
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>Jugular, superior thyroid,

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,170
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>左右颈动脉
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>common carotid, left and right--

81
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,660
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>能断的都切断了
<5-1,LANIE PARISH>You name it, it's been severed.

82
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,100
<5-2,CASTLE>那就解释了大量的血迹
<5-2,CASTLE>Well, that explains all the blood.

83
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,240
<5-3,LANIE>这一点  我无法解释
<5-3,LANIE>Here's what I can't explain--

84
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,200
<5-3,LANIE>伤口的深度及性质表明
<5-3,LANIE>Depth and nature of the wounds tell me

85
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,270
<5-3,LANIE>凶手与死者的距离一定很近
<5-3,LANIE>that the killer got up close and personal.

86
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
<5-4,BECKETT>那他的脚印在哪
<5-4,BECKETT>So then where are the footprints?

87
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,160
<5-5,LANIE>不止这些  瞧这些血迹的溅落
<5-5,LANIE>Not just that. Look at the blood spatter.

88
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,040
<5-5,LANIE>切断这么些动脉
<5-5,LANIE>You cut all those arteries,

89
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,660
<5-5,LANIE>血液应该会立刻
<5-5,LANIE>and the spray is gonna come fast

90
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,060
<5-5,LANIE>并且强烈地喷出来
<5-5,LANIE>and it's gonna come strong.

91
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,370
<5-6,CASTLE>我说那一定喷得满世界都是
<5-6,CASTLE>I'll say. It went everywhere.

92
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,320
<5-7,BECKETT>但不该如此
<5-7,BECKETT>But it shouldn't have.

93
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,190
<5-7,BECKETT>部分血迹本该溅到凶手身上
<5-7,BECKETT>Some of it should've landed on the killer.

94
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,040
<5-8,CASTLE>但每一滴血都落在了地上
<5-8,CASTLE>Yet every drop of it landed on the floor.

95
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,420
<5-8,CASTLE>溅落完全没有遇到任何阻碍物
<5-8,CASTLE>This spray is completely unobstructed.

96
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,170
<5-8,CASTLE>正是
<5-8,CASTLE>Exactly.

97
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,570
<5-9,LANIE>这根本说不通
<5-9,LANIE>It doesn't make sense.

98
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,660
<5-10,CASTLE>除非血滴穿透了凶手的身体
<5-10,CASTLE>Unless the blood passed right through the killer.

99
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,700
<5-11,LANIE>你是说凶手是鬼吗
<5-11,LANIE>Are you saying a ghost did this?

100
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,680
<5-12,BECKETT>别鼓励他胡扯了
<5-12,BECKETT>Please don't encourage him.

101
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,680
<5-12,BECKETT>我是说
<5-12,BECKETT>I'm saying,

102
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,920
<5-13,CASTLE>也许辛克莱先生终于碰到
<5-13,CASTLE>maybe Mr. Sinclair finally met a wraith

103
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,190
<5-13,CASTLE>他收不了的恶灵了
<5-13,CASTLE>he couldn't wrangle.

104
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,890
<5-14,BECKETT>蕾妮  报案的是什么人
<5-14,BECKETT>Lanie, who called this in?

105
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,340
<6-1,LULU>我是杰克的制片人
<6-1,LULU>I'm... Jack's producer.

106
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,940
<6-1,LULU>已经和他一起工作四年了
<6-1,LULU>I worked with him for the last four years.

107
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,390
<6-2,BECKETT>好的露露  我们只是想了解一下
<6-2,BECKETT>Okay, Lulu, we just need to know

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,020
<6-2,BECKETT>在你报警之前发生的所有事
<6-2,BECKETT>everything that happened before you called 911.

109
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,810
<12-16,BECKETT>好的
<12-16,BECKETT>Okay.

110
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,310
<6-2,BECKETT>杰克在七点左右进入这屋子
<6-2,BECKETT>Jack went in the house at around 7:00.

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,260
<6-3,LULU>几分钟后就把自己禁闭了
<6-3,LULU>And then he went on lockdown a few minutes after that.

112
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,620
<6-4,CASTLE>把自己关在一间屋子里过夜
<6-4,CASTLE>Uh, he locks himself into the house for the night.

113
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,160
<6-4,CASTLE>是猎鬼人的标准方案
<6-4,CASTLE>It's standard protocol for ghost hunters.

114
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,160
<6-5,BECKETT>-就他一个人在里面吗  -是的
<6-5,BECKETT>- And was he in there alone? - Yeah.

115
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,570
<6-6,LULU>在开始之前  我们总是会
<6-6,LULU>We always do a clean sweep of the place

116
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,670
<6-6,LULU>进行一次清查
<6-6,LULU>right before we start.

117
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,510
<6-6,LULU>然后他...  他把门锁上
<6-6,LULU>So he--he locked the doors,

118
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,100
<6-6,LULU>我就上技术器材装载车看监控了
<6-6,LULU>and then I went into the tech van to watch the feed.

119
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,080
<6-7,BECKETT>这段时间  摄影机一直在拍摄吗
<6-7,BECKETT>And were the cameras rolling the whole time?

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,690
<7-1,CASTLE>红外摄影机是用来监测
<7-1,CASTLE>The infrared cameras are to detect

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,870
<7-1,CASTLE>无法解释的热量异常
<7-1,CASTLE>unexplained thermal anomalies.

122
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,150
<7-2,JACK SINCLAIR>客厅  晚上九点零三分
<7-2,JACK SINCLAIR>Living room, 9:03 p.m..

123
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,900
<7-2,JACK SINCLAIR>电磁场侦测器接收到前所未有的强烈信号
<7-2,JACK SINCLAIR>EMF level spiking off the chart.

124
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,290
<7-3,CASTLE>那是针对电磁场运动的侦测器
<7-3,CASTLE>That's an electromagnetic field meter.

125
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,910
<7-3,CASTLE>捉鬼这行必备的行头
<7-3,CASTLE>That's a tool of the ghost busting trade.

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,380
<7-3,CASTLE>用来侦测超自然力量的信号
<7-3,CASTLE>It's used to measure spikes in paranormal energy.

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,790
<7-4,CASTLE>认真看吧
<7-4,CASTLE>Let's just watch.

128
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,540
<7-4,CASTLE>有人吗
<7-4,CASTLE>Hello?

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,100
<7-5,JACK>有人在那吗
<7-5,JACK>Is anyone there?

130
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,230
<7-5,JACK>梅夕[仁慈]
<7-5,JACK>Mercy...

131
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,130
<7-6,BECKETT>我看见了
<7-6,BECKETT>I can see it.

132
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,560
<7-6,BECKETT>梅夕[仁慈]
<7-6,BECKETT>Mercy...

133
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,640
<7-7,BECKETT>他好像在求凶手发慈悲  手下留情
<7-7,BECKETT>It sounds like he was begging his killer for mercy.

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,740
<7-7,BECKETT>发生什么事了
<7-7,BECKETT>What happened?

135
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,940
<7-8,LULU>没了  就这么多
<7-8,LULU>That--that's it.

136
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,900
<7-8,LULU>所有摄影机在那一刻全都被中断了
<7-8,LULU>That's when all the camera signals cut out at once.

137
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,140
<7-8,LULU>所有画面都没了
<7-8,LULU>And what could explain the picture

138
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,320
<7-9,BECKETT>是什么造成的呢
<7-9,BECKETT>suddenly going out like that?

139
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,510
<7-10,LULU>我不知道  以前从没发生过
<7-10,LULU>I don't know. It's never happened before.

140
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,840
<7-11,CASTLE>《黑道家族》最后一集就是这样
<7-11,CASTLE>Well, there was that last episode of "The Sopranos."

141
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,030
<7-12,BECKETT>不  没可能的
<7-12,BECKETT>No, there's no way.

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,430
<7-12,BECKETT>当时一定有人跟杰克在一起
<7-12,BECKETT>Jack had to have been in there with someone else.

143
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,860
<7-13,BECKETT>他有任何敌人吗
<7-13,BECKETT>Did he have any enemies,

144
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,340
<7-13,BECKETT>最近跟他有矛盾的人
<7-13,BECKETT>anybody that he was having problems with recently?

145
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,860
<7-14,LULU>没有  至少我不知道
<7-14,LULU>No, not that I know of.

146
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,080
<7-14,LULU>他来禁闭时的确有点心烦意乱的
<7-14,LULU>He... he did show up to lockdown upset.

147
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,070
<7-15,BECKETT>-你知道他是从哪过来的吗  -不知道
<7-15,BECKETT>- Do you know where he was coming from? - No.

148
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,350
<7-16,LULU>他从计程车上下来  拿了他的工具
<7-16,LULU>He pulled up in a cab and grabbed his gear

149
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,540
<7-16,LULU>就进去了
<7-16,LULU>and just went inside.

150
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,480
<7-17,BECKETT>还有人有此处的钥匙吗
<7-17,BECKETT>Did anyone else have keys to this place?

151
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,020
<7-18,LULU>只有杰克和巴里·B
<7-18,LULU>Just Jack and Barry B.

152
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,980
<7-19,CASTLE>巴里·巴夫塔  杰克的摄影师
<7-19,CASTLE>Barry Bavetta. That's Jack's cameraman.

153
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,790
<7-19,CASTLE>巴里人呢
<7-19,CASTLE>Where is Barry?

154
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,490
<7-19,CASTLE>他通常不是与杰克一起禁闭吗
<7-19,CASTLE>Doesn't he usually do lockdown with Jack?

155
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,300
<7-20,LULU>今天下午他和杰克吵了一架
<7-20,LULU>He and Jack had an argument this afternoon.

156
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,860
<7-20,LULU>闹得很僵  然后巴里就辞职了
<7-20,LULU>Things got pretty heated, and then Barry just quit.

157
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,410
<7-21,BECKETT>他有可能把摄影机设置成
<7-21,BECKETT>Could he have programmed the cameras

158
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,570
<7-21,BECKETT>像那样自动关闭吗
<7-21,BECKETT>to turn off like that?

159
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,430
<7-22,LULU>事实上  他是可以的
<7-22,LULU>Actually... Yeah, he could.

160
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,330
<8-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>巴里·巴夫塔于七点半急忙地从酒店退房
<8-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Barry Bavetta checked out of his hotel in a hurry at 7:30.

161
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,060
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>足够他在九点杰克被杀的时候
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>That's enough time to make it back to the house

162
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,920
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>回到宅子里
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>by 9:00 when Jack was killed.

163
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,860
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>巴里的电话还是直转语音信箱
<8-2,KEVIN RYAN>Barry's phone is still going straight to voice mail.

164
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,030
<8-3,ESPOSITO>经理把他的信用卡信息给我了
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Well, the manager gave me his credit card info,

165
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,700
<8-3,ESPOSITO>如果走运  他可能会用卡
<8-3,ESPOSITO>so if we're lucky he's out there using it.

166
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,030
<8-4,RYAN>好吧  我得开始啃那卷
<8-4,RYAN>All right, I'm gonna start scrubbing this footage

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,970
<8-4,RYAN>在屋里拍的录影带了
<8-4,RYAN>from inside of the house.

168
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,830
<8-4,RYAN>也许里面有些什么会涉及到这家伙
<8-4,RYAN>Maybe there's something in there that can implicate this guy.

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,410
<8-5,ESPOSITO>好的  嘿
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Right. Hey.

170

<8-5,ESPOSITO>我们明天还是一起吃晚餐  对吧
<8-5,ESPOSITO>We're still on for dinner tomorrow night, right?

171
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,340
<8-6,RYAN>对  珍妮兴奋极了
<8-6,RYAN>Oh, yeah. Jenny's totally psyched.

172
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,720
<8-6,RYAN>她从来都没和蕾妮一起出去过  这不错
<8-6,RYAN>She's never really hung out with Lanie before, so cool.

173
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,880
<8-7,ESPOSITO>提前告诉你一声
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Well, just to let you know,

174
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,470
<8-7,ESPOSITO>那会儿蕾妮刚下双班
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Lanie's gonna be getting off a double shift,

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,830
<8-7,ESPOSITO>她会有点暴躁的
<8-7,ESPOSITO>so she could be a little cranky.

176
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,850
<8-8,RYAN>那我们还是改日子吧
<8-8,RYAN>Oh. Maybe we should reschedule.

177
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,120
<8-8,RYAN>我是说这不都是为了
<8-8,RYAN>I mean, isn't the whole point

178
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,580
<8-8,RYAN>让蕾妮和和珍妮好好相处吗
<8-8,RYAN>for Jenny and Lanie to get along?

<8-9,ESPOSITO>没事  她会很亲切的
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Nah, she'll be cool.

180
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,510
<8-9,ESPOSITO>只是别提什么有争议性的话题
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Just, you know, don't say anything controversial.

181
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,420
<8-10,RYAN>比如说
<8-10,RYAN>Like what?

182
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,460
<8-10,RYAN>什么叫有争议性的
<8-10,RYAN>What's controversial?

183
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,550
<8-11,ESPOSITO>宾果[既有答对了的意思也是游戏名]
<8-11,ESPOSITO>Bingo.

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,180
<8-12,RYAN>宾果  不能说宾果游戏
<8-12,RYAN>Bingo? Don't talk about bingo?

185
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,390
<8-13,ESPOSITO>巴里·巴夫塔一直挺忙  他的大腿也没闲着
<8-13,ESPOSITO>Barry Bavetta's been busy, and so has his lap.

186
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,750
<8-13,ESPOSITO>这哥们在机场边上的脱衣舞俱乐部挥霍了一大笔钱
<8-13,ESPOSITO>Dude has racked up a hell of a tab at a strip club by the airport.

187

<9-1,BECKETT>抱歉打断了你的乐子  巴里
<9-1,BECKETT>Sorry to interrupt your fun, Barry.

<9-2,CASTLE>我们听说你花了一大笔钱
<9-2,CASTLE>We heard you were racking up quite a bill.

190
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,580
<9-2,CASTLE>用来买"波涛汹涌"了
<9-2,CASTLE>Or is that billing quite a rack?

191
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,330
<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>那怎么了  看大腿舞也违法了
<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>So what, getting a lap dance is illegal now?

192
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,260
<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>听着  我就是想找点乐子
<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>Look, I was just blowing off some steam.

193

<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>一天都不太顺
<9-3,BARRY BAVETTA>Haven't had the best day.

194
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,150
<9-4,BECKETT>是啊  我们也听说了
<9-4,BECKETT>Yeah, so we heard.

195
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,280
<9-4,BECKETT>你的制片人说你和杰克·辛克莱
<9-4,BECKETT>Your producer said that you and Jack Sinclair

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,010
<9-5,BARRY>我们是吵起来了
<9-5,BARRY>We got into it.

199
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,360
<9-5,BARRY>这也不是我们第一次争吵了
<9-5,BARRY>Wasn't the first fight we ever had,

200
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,590
<9-5,BARRY>但是我保证是最后一次了
<9-5,BARRY>but I made sure it'll be the last.

201
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,620
<9-6,CASTLE>你何不说说怎么回事呢  巴里
<9-6,CASTLE>Why don't you tell us what happened, Barry?

202
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,310
<9-7,BARRY>就是杰克耍了我这么回事
<9-7,BARRY>Jack screwed me over is what happened.

203
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
<9-7,BARRY>他最后时刻告诉我
<9-7,BARRY>He told me last-minute

204
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,610
<9-7,BARRY>我今晚不能和他一起进入到禁区里了
<9-7,BARRY>I wasn't going with him on lockdown tonight.

205
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,030
<9-8,BECKETT>为什么
<9-8,BECKETT>Any reason?

206
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,060
<9-9,BARRY>他给我的唯一原因就是他是老板
<9-9,BARRY>The only one he gave was, he's the boss.

207
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,600
<9-9,BARRY>但实际上是他妒忌我
<9-9,BARRY>But... It's 'cause he's jealous.

208
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,930
<9-9,BARRY>担心我会抢走他的风头
<9-9,BARRY>Worried I'm gonna walk off with all the credit.

209
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,740
<27-4,CASTLE>为什么
<27-4,CASTLE>Why is that?

210
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,240
<9-10,CASTLE>因为我们今晚拍摄的这一集
<9-10,CASTLE>Because the episode we're doing tonight,

211
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,510
<9-11,BARRY>麦拉伦老宅  是我的主意
<9-11,BARRY>the McClaren House, was my idea.

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,870
<9-11,BARRY>我做了所有的调查
<9-11,BARRY>I did all the research.

213
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,880
<9-11,BARRY>杰克根本就不想拍
<9-11,BARRY>Jack didn't even want to do the damn show.

214
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,030
<9-12,CASTLE>他为什么不想拍
<9-12,CASTLE>Why wouldn't Jack want to do

215
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,620
<9-12,CASTLE>一个纽约的鬼屋凶宅呢
<9-12,CASTLE>a show about a haunted mansion in New York?

216
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,110
<9-12,CASTLE>听起来收视保证登顶啊
<9-12,CASTLE>That sounds like ratings gold.

217
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
<9-13,BARRY>杰克对纽约很别扭
<9-13,BARRY>Jack's weird about New York.

218
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,760
<9-13,BARRY>他在这里长大
<9-13,BARRY>He was brought up here,

219
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,840
<9-13,BARRY>但是他却对回到这里有些古怪的厌恶
<9-13,BARRY>but he's got some strange aversion to coming back.

220
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,330
<9-13,BARRY>他试图阻拦整件事
<9-13,BARRY>He tried to torpedo the whole thing,

221
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,310
<9-13,BARRY>说他才不会在那间房子里出洋相[死]呢
<9-13,BARRY>said he wouldn't be caught dead in that house.

222
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,100
<9-14,CASTLE>所以你就决定证明他是错的
<9-14,CASTLE>And you decided to prove him wrong?

223
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,820
<9-15,BARRY>什么
<9-15,BARRY>What?

224
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,190
<9-16,BECKETT>杰克·辛克莱今晚在麦拉伦老宅被杀
<9-16,BECKETT>Jack Sinclair was killed in the McClaren House tonight.

225
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,430
<9-17,BARRY>被杀了
<9-17,BARRY>Killed?

226
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,210
<9-18,BECKETT>巴里  你为什么不把钥匙还给房主呢
<9-18,BECKETT>Barry, why didn't you give your keys back to the owner?

227
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,000
<9-19,BARRY>因为  我
<9-19,BARRY>Uh, I'm--I was--

228
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,350
<9-19,BARRY>我太生气了  我忘了
<9-19,BARRY>I was, uh, upset. I forgot.

229
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,270
<9-19,BARRY>他真的死了
<9-19,BARRY>Is--is--is he really dead?

230
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,060
<9-20,CASTLE>你是设置机位的人  对吗
<9-20,CASTLE>You were the one who set up the cameras, right?

231
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,110
<9-20,CASTLE>是
<9-20,CASTLE>Yeah.

232
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,700
<9-21,BARRY>所以呢
<9-21,BARRY>So?

233
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,490
<9-22,BECKETT>所以你知道摄像机的确切位置
<9-22,BECKETT>So you knew exactly where they were placed

234
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,700
<9-22,BECKETT>也知道当你潜回宅子时如何才能不被拍到
<9-22,BECKETT>and how to avoid them when you snuck back in the house.

235
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,440
<9-22,BECKETT>你甚至知道如何设定它们
<9-22,BECKETT>You even knew how to program them

236
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,870
<9-22,BECKETT>让它们在特定的时间关闭
<9-22,BECKETT>to turn off at a certain point.

237
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,320
<9-23,BARRY>打住  打住  我才没杀杰克
<9-23,BARRY>Whoa, whoa. I did not kill Jack.

238
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,660
<9-23,BARRY>我根本就不在场
<9-23,BARRY>I wasn't even there.

239
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,890
<9-23,BARRY>我被安检拖住了
<9-23,BARRY>I got stuck in the security line

240
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,210
<9-23,BARRY>错过了去洛杉矶的飞机
<9-23,BARRY>and missed my flight to L.A.

241
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,530
<9-23,BARRY>之后我就直接去了脱衣舞俱乐部
<9-23,BARRY>I went to the strip club right after that.

242
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,660
<9-23,BARRY>你们可以查到的
<9-23,BARRY>You can check that.

243
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,120
<10-1,BECKETT>运输安全局证实了巴里
<10-1,BECKETT>So T.S.A. has Barry

244
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,620
<10-1,BECKETT>在九点一刻通过肯尼迪机场安检
<10-1,BECKETT>going through security at 9:15 at J.F.K.

245
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,860
<10-1,BECKETT>他根本不可能在案发时
<10-1,BECKETT>There's no way that he was in the house

246
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,670
<10-1,BECKETT>出现在案发现场
<10-1,BECKETT>at the time of the murder.

247
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,510
<10-2,ESPOSITO>另外技术人员检查了那些摄像机
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Plus, tech checked out those cameras.

248
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,780
<10-2,ESPOSITO>它们的关闭并不是设定好的
<10-2,ESPOSITO>They weren't programmed to turn off.

249
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,610
<10-2,ESPOSITO>巴里只是消磨[杀掉]了
<10-2,ESPOSITO>The only thing Barry's guilty of killing

250
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,330
<10-2,ESPOSITO>在脱衣舞俱乐部的欢乐时光
<10-2,ESPOSITO>is time at that strip club.

251
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,670
<10-3,CASTLE>所以  如果巴里不是我们要找的人
<10-3,CASTLE>So... If Barry's not our guy,

252
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,400
<10-3,CASTLE>那我想我们应该再考虑有没有可能
<10-3,CASTLE>I think it's time we revisit the possibility

253
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,090
<10-3,CASTLE>我们的凶手是个
<10-3,CASTLE>that our killer's a--

254
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,940
<10-4,BECKETT>你要说是鬼  我就赶你回家
<10-4,BECKETT>If you say ghost, I'm sending you home.

255
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,250
<10-5,CASTLE>美国幽灵
<10-5,CASTLE>Apparition-American.

256
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,020
<10-6,CASTLE>你找出了解释血迹的其他原因了吗
<10-6,CASTLE>Have you figured out another way to explain the blood spatter?

257
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,130
<10-7,BECKETT>目前还没  但是会的
<10-7,BECKETT>No, I haven't, but I will.

258
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,210
<10-7,BECKETT>杰克·辛克莱今晚
<10-7,BECKETT>Apparently Jack Sinclair was very upset

259
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,780
<10-7,BECKETT>坐计程车来的时候心烦意乱
<10-7,BECKETT>when he arrived in a taxi cab tonight,

260
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,730
<10-7,BECKETT>我们查查他的上车地点
<10-7,BECKETT>so let's find out where that cab picked him up

261
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,680
<10-7,BECKETT>和他在那里都做了些什么
<10-7,BECKETT>and what he was doing there.

262
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,660
<10-8,ESPOSITO>收到
<10-8,ESPOSITO>Roger that.

263
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,600
<10-9,BECKETT>等着瞧吧  卡塞尔  这个案子和其他的
<10-9,BECKETT>You'll see, Castle. This will turn out just like

264
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,280
<10-9,BECKETT>谋杀案调查没什么区别
<10-9,BECKETT>every other murder investigation.

265
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,980
<10-9,BECKETT>我们一旦了解更多死者生前的事
<10-9,BECKETT>Once we find out more about our victim's life,

266
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,610
<10-9,BECKETT>和他死亡的细节
<10-9,BECKETT>the details surrounding his death,

267
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,020
<10-9,BECKETT>一切事情就都能解释了
<10-9,BECKETT>everything will be explained.

268
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,670
<10-10,RYAN>或许有的事解释不了
<10-10,RYAN>Maybe not everything.

269
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,860
<11-1,RYAN>我在复查今晚宅子里的录像
<11-1,RYAN>I was reviewing the footage shot inside the house tonight

270
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,290
<11-1,RYAN>寻找那里当时有其他人的迹象
<11-1,RYAN>looking for signs that someone else was there--

271
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,010
<11-1,RYAN>影子  倒影  什么的
<11-1,RYAN>A-a shadow, a reflection, something.

272
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,210
<11-1,RYAN>但是  我发现
<11-1,RYAN>Instead, I found, uh,

273
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,270
<11-1,RYAN>你们还是自己看看吧
<11-1,RYAN>well, you better see for yourself.

274
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,790
<11-2,RYAN>我慢放了录像
<11-2,RYAN>So I slowed down the video.

275
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,270
<11-2,RYAN>看背景的三脚架
<11-2,RYAN>Watch the tripod in the background.

276
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,090
<11-3,RYAN>那里  你看
<11-3,RYAN>There. You see it.

277
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,750
<11-4,BECKETT>我相信一定会有个简单的解释
<11-4,BECKETT>I'm sure there's a perfectly simple explanation

278
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,940
<11-4,BECKETT>来说明所有事情
<11-4,BECKETT>for all of that.

279
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,300
<11-5,CASTLE>那就是
<11-5,CASTLE>There is.

280
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,930
<11-5,CASTLE>鬼来了[电影《鬼驱人》的名句]
<11-5,CASTLE>They're here.

290
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,040
<12-1,BECKETT>你休息过吗
<12-1,BECKETT>Whoa. Did you get any sleep?

291
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,660
<12-2,CASTLE>都没合过眼  但是绝对值得
<12-2,CASTLE>Not a wink, but it was worth it.

292
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,900
<12-2,CASTLE>在调查了麦拉伦老宅的历史后
<12-2,CASTLE>After researching the history of the McClaren Mansion,

293
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,930
<12-2,CASTLE>我想我知道了我们的死者
<12-2,CASTLE>I think I know what happened

294
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,680
<12-2,CASTLE>猎鬼人杰克·辛克莱的遭遇了
<12-2,CASTLE>to our victim, ghost hunter Jack Sinclair.

295
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,210
<12-2,CASTLE>顺便说一声  咖啡是给你的
<12-2,CASTLE>That coffee's for you, by the way. Oh.

296
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,030
<12-4,CASTLE>那一杯  那是
<12-4,CASTLE>Oh, the--the other one. That's...

297
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,740
<12-4,CASTLE>那是
<12-4,CASTLE>That's--

298
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,090
<12-5,CASTLE>我再给你  我再给你做一杯
<12-5,CASTLE>I'll make you a-- I'll make you one.

299
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,200
<12-6,CASTLE>自从麦拉伦老宅在1898年落成后
<12-6,CASTLE>Um, since the McClaren Mansion was built in 1898,

300
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,350
<12-6,CASTLE>死人的速度让
<12-6,CASTLE>bodies have been piling up

301
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,950
<12-6,CASTLE>塔伦蒂诺的电影甘拜下风了
<12-6,CASTLE>faster than a tarantino movie.

302
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,510
<12-6,CASTLE>总计八起凶案
<12-6,CASTLE>Eight killings in all,

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,870
<12-6,CASTLE>首先是最早的房主罗伯特·佩特洛
<12-6,CASTLE>starting with the original owner, Robert Pettigrew,

304
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,190
<12-6,CASTLE>在1903年被掐死
<12-6,CASTLE>strangled, 1903.

305
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,730
<12-6,CASTLE>一直到梅兰妮·本顿
<12-6,CASTLE>All the way to Melanie Benton,

306
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,510
<12-6,CASTLE>在1991年被砍成了碎片
<12-6,CASTLE>hacked to pieces in 1991.

307
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,340
<12-6,CASTLE>目前的房主名叫史蒂夫·福勒
<12-6,CASTLE>The current owner, Steve Fuller,

308
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,010
<12-6,CASTLE>曾想要拆掉房子
<12-6,CASTLE>tried to have the house torn down,

309
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,190
<12-7,BECKETT>但是被有关部门认定为地标建筑
<12-7,BECKETT>but it was declared a landmark by the society for historic--

310
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,340
<12-7,BECKETT>不好意思  卡塞尔
<12-7,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Castle.

311
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,100
<12-7,BECKETT>我很感谢你的工作  真的
<12-7,BECKETT>I appreciate your work. I do.

312
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,450
<12-7,BECKETT>但是这和我们的案子有什么关系
<12-7,BECKETT>But what does this have to do with our case?

313
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,090
<12-8,CASTLE>就快说到了
<12-8,CASTLE>Just getting to that.

314
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,430
<12-8,CASTLE>似乎看起来在所有的谋杀中
<12-8,CASTLE>It seems that in almost all of these killings,

315
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,170
<12-8,CASTLE>凶手都声称  准备好了没
<12-8,CASTLE>the killer claimed that there was a--ready for this?

316
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,410
<12-8,CASTLE>和一个恶鬼有关
<12-8,CASTLE>That a demon was responsible.

317
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,650
<12-9,BECKETT>恶鬼  不是吧
<12-9,BECKETT>A demon? Really?

318
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,000
<12-10,CASTLE>这可不是人家编的  白纸黑字
<12-10,CASTLE>I'm not making this up. It's in the books.

319
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,060
<12-11,BECKETT>好吧  一个恶鬼杀了杰克·辛克莱.
<12-11,BECKETT>Fine. A demon killed Jack Sinclair.

320
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,110
<12-11,BECKETT>那我们要做什么
<12-11,BECKETT>So what's our next step?

321
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,220
<12-11,BECKETT>我们是不是要监视房子
<12-11,BECKETT>Are we gonna stake out the house,

322
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,040
<12-11,BECKETT>等着恶鬼现身  再用质子枪把它杀了
<12-11,BECKETT>wait for the demon to show up, zap him with our proton pack?

323
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,940
<12-12,CASTLE>那不是正宗的  你懂不
<12-12,CASTLE>That's not a real thing, you know,

324
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,920
<12-12,CASTLE>真正的猎鬼人不使质子枪
<12-12,CASTLE>that real ghost hunters use.

325
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,270
<12-13,ESPOSITO>真正的猎鬼人
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Real ghost hunters?

326
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,050
<12-13,ESPOSITO>这不是有点自相矛盾吗  伙计
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Isn't that a contradiction in terms, bro?

327
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,210
<12-14,BECKETT>好了  有没有人能说点和案子相关的
<12-14,BECKETT>Okay. Does anyone have anything pertinent to our case?

328
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,910
<12-15,ESPOSITO>我能
<12-15,ESPOSITO>I do.

329
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,530
<12-16,BECKETT>好
<12-16,BECKETT>Okay.

330
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,740
<12-17,ESPOSITO>我找到了死者当晚所乘的出租车
<12-17,ESPOSITO>I tracked down that cab our vic took last night.

331
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,150
<12-17,ESPOSITO>驾驶员的行驶记录显示
<12-17,ESPOSITO>The driver's trip log says

332
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,740
<12-17,ESPOSITO>杰克在38号和9号大街拐角处上的车
<12-17,ESPOSITO>that he picked up Jack on the corner of 38th and 9th.

333
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,920
<12-18,BECKETT>让警员们带着杰克的照片排查那里
<12-18,BECKETT>Have uniforms canvass the area with jack's photo.

334
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,980
<12-18,BECKETT>看看他去那里干什么
<12-18,BECKETT>Let's see what he was up to.

335
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,040
<12-19,ESPOSITO>还有通话记录
<12-19,ESPOSITO>Oh, and phone records, too.

336
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,820
<12-19,ESPOSITO>或许能查出点什么
<12-19,ESPOSITO>Maybe that'll shed some light on things.

337
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,210
<12-19,ESPOSITO>我觉得我能提供点
<12-19,ESPOSITO>I think I can shed some light

338
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,830
<12-20,RYAN>杰克不愿意来这儿录节目的原因
<12-20,RYAN>on why Jack didn't want to do the show here.

339
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,360
<12-20,RYAN>我和一个前几天
<12-20,RYAN>Talked to an old high school pal

340
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,300
<12-20,RYAN>同他共进早餐的高中同学聊了聊
<12-20,RYAN>that Jack had breakfast with a couple of days ago.

341
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,950
<12-20,RYAN>原来死者以前就住在
<12-20,RYAN>Turns out that our vic actually used to live

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,450
<12-20,RYAN>麦拉伦老宅附近
<12-20,RYAN>right near the McClaren House.

343
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,610
<12-20,RYAN>他曾经为了避免经过那房子
<12-20,RYAN>Said that he used to walk a couple blocks out of his way

344
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,040
<12-20,RYAN>绕开几个街区走
<12-20,RYAN>just to avoid walking past it.

345
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,070
<12-20,RYAN>据说那里让他毛骨悚然
<12-20,RYAN>Said it gave him a creeped out feeling.

346
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,330
<12-21,CASTLE>听到没  我就告诉你
<12-21,CASTLE>You see? I am telling you,

347
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,620
<12-21,CASTLE>这房子有问题
<12-21,CASTLE>there is something going on with this house.

348
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,220
<12-22,CASTLE>最后住在  那个
<12-22,CASTLE>The last people... Well, to--

349
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,100
<12-22,CASTLE>最后住在那里的住户
<12-22,CASTLE>The last people that lived there

350
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,230
<12-23,CASTLE>四年前匆匆忙忙地搬走了
<12-23,CASTLE>moved out four years ago in a hurry.

351
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,010
<12-24,RYAN>为什么
<12-24,RYAN>Why?

352
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,110
<12-25,CASTLE>不知道  可我觉得是时候找出谜底了
<12-25,CASTLE>I don't know, but I think it's time we found out.

353
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,150
<12-26,BECKETT>你自己随便去查吧 卡塞尔
<12-26,BECKETT>Knock yourself out, Castle.

354
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,020
<12-28,BECKETT>-你不来吗  -不  我还有谋杀案要侦破
<12-28,BECKETT>- You're not coming? - No, I've got a murder to solve.

355
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,130
<12-29,RYAN>我去
<12-29,RYAN>I'll go.

356
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,660
<12-30,CASTLE>-她在瞪你了  -没错
<12-30,CASTLE>- Ooh. That's a look. - Yeah.

357
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,860
<12-32,CASTLE>我被她瞪多了  快走就是了
<12-32,CASTLE>I get these a lot. Just start walking.

358
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,580
<12-33,CASTLE>-走吧  -快点
<12-33,CASTLE>- Let's go. - Faster.

359
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,720
<13-1,ESPOSITO>我刚在楼下看到莱恩
<13-1,ESPOSITO>I just saw Ryan downstairs.

360
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,570
<13-1,ESPOSITO>没想到你会让他和卡塞尔一起去找鬼
<13-1,ESPOSITO>I can't believe you let him go chasing ghosts with Castle.

362
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,090
<13-2,BECKETT>没错  也许薛吉会让史酷比少惹麻烦
<13-2,BECKETT>Yeah. Maybe Shaggy will keep Scooby out of trouble.

363
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,330
<13-2,BECKETT>而且  世事难料
<13-2,BECKETT>Besides, you never know.

364
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,890
<13-2,BECKETT>没准他们能找到些有用的东西呢
<13-2,BECKETT>Maybe they'll come up with something useful.

365
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,570
<13-3,ESPOSITO>你想要有用的东西
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Oh, you want useful?

366
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,140
<13-3,ESPOSITO>我刚和鉴证组谈过了
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Because I just spoke to C.S.U.

367
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,750
<13-3,ESPOSITO>他们在现场找到了
<13-3,ESPOSITO>They found fingerprints at the scene

368
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,950
<13-3,ESPOSITO>一个大活人的指纹
<13-3,ESPOSITO>from a real live person, so...

369
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,010
<13-3,ESPOSITO>他叫朗·博格  住在皇后区
<13-3,ESPOSITO>His name is Ron Berger. He lives in Queens.

370
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,960
<14-1,ESPOSITO>-已经去抓他了  -有前科吗
<14-1,ESPOSITO>- They're picking him up now. - Does he have a record?

371
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,550
<14-2,BECKETT>有  这小混混因为持刀抢劫
<14-2,BECKETT>Yeah. Chuckles did eight years

372
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,810
<14-3,ESPOSITO>蹲了八年班房
<14-3,ESPOSITO>for armed robbery with a knife.

373
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,630
<14-3,ESPOSITO>也曾涉及入室抢劫  所以
<14-3,ESPOSITO>He's also dabbled in B&E, which makes

374
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,620
<14-3,ESPOSITO>闯入个上锁的房子对他来说不成问题
<14-3,ESPOSITO>breaking into a locked house no problem for this guy.

375
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,030
<14-4,BECKETT>他什么时候出狱的
<14-4,BECKETT>When did he get out of prison?

376
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,930
<14-5,ESPOSITO>五周以前
<14-5,ESPOSITO>Five weeks ago.

377
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,390
<14-6,BECKETT>总算有条靠谱的线索了
<14-6,BECKETT>Ohh, finally a lead that makes sense.

378
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,480
<14-7,ESPOSITO>还不止如此
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, it gets better.

379
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,060
<14-7,ESPOSITO>朗和死者有过节
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Ron has a history with our vic.

381
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,110
<14-7,ESPOSITO>牧鬼人曾经在五点监狱拍摄过一期节目
<14-7,ESPOSITO>"Ghost Wranglers" did a piece on Five Points Correctional,

382
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
<14-7,ESPOSITO>朗也入镜了
<14-7,ESPOSITO>and Ron was featured.

383
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,890
<14-7,ESPOSITO>声称他牢房里有个幽灵
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Claims he was sharing his cell with a spirit.

384
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,330
<14-8,BECKETT>也算是监狱人满为患的一种
<14-8,BECKETT>Well, that's prison overcrowding for you.

386
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,810
<14-9,ESPOSITO>看起来  卡斯珀有点过分友好了
<14-9,ESPOSITO>Apparently, Casper was being a little too friendly,

387
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,500
<14-9,ESPOSITO>对朗毛手毛脚
<14-9,ESPOSITO>touching Ron in all the wrong places.

388
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,060
<14-10,BECKETT>被鬼性骚扰吗
<14-10,BECKETT>Molested by a ghost. Mm-hmm.

389
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,070
<14-10,BECKETT>有的人为了上电视什么都肯做啊
<14-10,BECKETT>Wow. Some people will do anything to get on TV.

390
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,260
<14-11,ESPOSITO>但事与愿违
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except it backfired on him.

391
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,560
<14-11,ESPOSITO>朗成了整个监狱的笑柄
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Ron became the laughingstock of the prison yard.

392
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,000
<14-11,ESPOSITO>他气急败坏
<14-11,ESPOSITO>He got all pissed off,

393
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,490
<14-11,ESPOSITO>给节目写了一封信
<14-11,ESPOSITO>and he wrote the show a letter.

394
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,550
<14-12,BECKETT>"我要让杰克·辛克莱为他所做的事
<14-12,BECKETT>"I'm gonna make Jack Sinclair bleed

395
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
<14-12,BECKETT>血债血偿"
<14-12,BECKETT>for what he did to me."

396
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,840
<15-1,RON BERGER>是我写的信
<15-1,RON BERGER>I wrote that letter, yeah.

397
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,820
<15-1,RON BERGER>不过也就此为止了  我没有杀他
<15-1,RON BERGER>But that was as far as it went. I-I didn't kill him.

398
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,650
<15-2,BECKETT>昨晚九点你在哪里
<15-2,BECKETT>Where were you last night at 9:00 p.m.?

399
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,370
<15-3,RON>我在家  看动画片
<15-3,RON>I was at home, watching cartoons.

400
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,600
<15-5,RON>你们可以去问我妈
<15-5,RON>You can ask my mom.

401
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,490
<15-6,ESPOSITO>有个问题  朗  我们在麦拉伦老宅里
<15-6,ESPOSITO>Well, we have a problem, Ron, because we found

402
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,520
<15-6,ESPOSITO>发现了你的指纹
<15-6,ESPOSITO>your fingerprints inside the McClaren House.

403
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,210
<15-7,RON>我能解释这事
<15-7,RON>I-I-I can explain that.

404
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,950
<15-8,ESPOSITO>说吧
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I'm waiting.

405
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,930
<15-9,RON>我不能违反我的假释规定
<15-9,RON>I-I can't violate my parole.

406
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,640
<15-9,RON>我不想再回去五点监狱了
<15-9,RON>I can't go back to Five Points,

407
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,910
<15-9,RON>不能再回牢房里  不能再和
<15-9,RON>not--not in that cell, not--not with that...

408
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,370
<15-9,RON>那玩意呆在一起
<15-9,RON>Thing.

409
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,480
<15-10,BECKETT>你在害怕那个鬼吗
<15-10,BECKETT>You're worried about your ghost?

410
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:04,950
<15-10,BECKETT>朗  你现在被控凶杀
<15-10,BECKETT>Ron, you're looking at murder.

411
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,630
<15-10,BECKETT>你的不在场证明不堪一击
<15-10,BECKETT>You've got a flimsy alibi.

412
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,730
<15-10,BECKETT>整个犯罪现场布满了你的指纹
<15-10,BECKETT>Your fingerprints are all over the crime scene.

413
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,830
<15-10,BECKETT>你有作案的手法  动机  时机
<15-10,BECKETT>You had means, motive, and opportunity.

414
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,990
<15-11,RON>好吧  好吧
<15-11,RON>All right, all right.

415
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,240
<15-11,RON>我的确去过那儿
<15-11,RON>I was there.

416
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,520
<15-11,RON>可不是昨晚
<15-11,RON>Just, uh, not last night.

417
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,620
<15-11,RON>是一个月以前
<15-11,RON>About a month ago.

418
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,720
<15-11,RON>我去是因为杰克
<15-11,RON>I was there because of Jack.

419
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,210
<15-11,RON>我出狱后他打电话来
<15-11,RON>He--he called me after I got out.

420
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,130
<15-12,BECKETT>你威胁过杰克·辛克莱
<15-12,BECKETT>Jack Sinclair called you,

421
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,520
<15-12,BECKETT>他还给你打电话吗
<15-12,BECKETT>after you threatened him?

422
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,140
<15-13,RON>他是为了监狱的节目向我道歉
<15-13,RON>To apologize for the prison show thing,

423
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,450
<15-13,RON>他还求我办件事
<15-13,RON>and he--he had a request.

424
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,780
<15-14,BECKETT>求你什么事
<15-14,BECKETT>What kind of a request?

425
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,360
<15-15,RON>是件怪事
<15-15,RON>Uh, it was a strange one.

426
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,080
<15-15,RON>他想让我进麦拉伦老宅拍些照
<15-15,RON>He wanted me to take pictures inside the McClaren House.

427
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,840
<15-17,RON>-为什么要你去  -那房子上了锁
<15-17,RON>- Why you? - It was locked up.

428
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,250
<15-17,RON>所以  我得闯进去
<15-17,RON>So, uh... I had to break in.

429
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,840
<15-18,BECKETT>他告诉你拍照的理由了吗
<15-18,BECKETT>Did he give you any reason for asking for those pictures?

430
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,900
<15-19,BECKETT>好吧  我们需要看看那些照片
<15-19,BECKETT>Okay. We're gonna need to see the photos.

431
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,290
<16-1,ESPOSITO>技术部门分析了这张记忆卡
<16-1,ESPOSITO>So tech analyzed the S.D. card.

432
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,300
<16-1,ESPOSITO>日期标记没有动过手脚
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Time/date stamp was not messed with.

433
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,020
<16-2,BECKETT>-所以朗说的是实话了  -照片这事是真的
<16-2,BECKETT>- So then Ron was telling the truth? - Well, about the photos.

434
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,660
<16-3,ESPOSITO>我还是不相信那个被鬼骚扰的故事
<16-3,ESPOSITO>I'm still not buying the whole "touched by a phantom" routine.

435
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,110
<16-4,BECKETT>我在想杰克要这些照片的目的
<16-4,BECKETT>I wonder what Jack wanted with all these photos.

436
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,730
<16-4,BECKETT>所有的照片都是同一个房间的
<16-4,BECKETT>You know, all of the pictures are of just one room--

437
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,480
<16-4,BECKETT>客厅
<16-4,BECKETT>The living room.

438
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,400
<16-4,BECKETT>也正是犯罪现场的房间
<16-4,BECKETT>That's the same room as the crime scene.

439
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,990
<16-5,ESPOSITO>杰克雇了朗·博格去拍
<16-5,ESPOSITO>So Jack hired Ron Berger to take pictures

440
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,850
<16-5,ESPOSITO>他即将死在里面的房间的照片
<16-5,ESPOSITO>of the very room he was gonna die in.

441
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,080
<16-6,ESPOSITO>真让人毛骨悚然
<16-6,ESPOSITO>That's creepy.

442
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,080
<16-7,BECKETT>没什么毛骨悚然的  卡塞尔
<16-7,BECKETT>That's not creepy, Castle.

443
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,590
<16-7,BECKETT>我确定一切都可以被解释的
<16-7,BECKETT>I'm sure it can all be explained

444
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,770
<16-7,BECKETT>我打赌那间客厅
<16-7,BECKETT>and I bet you that living room

445
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,620
<16-7,BECKETT>和鬼怪神魔都沾不上边
<16-7,BECKETT>has absolutely nothing to do with ghosts or demons.

446
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,550
<17-1,MARGARET BOYER>那间客厅  毫无疑问
<17-1,MARGARET BOYER>The living room, definitely.

447
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,590
<17-1,MARGARET BOYER>是活动的中心点
<17-1,MARGARET BOYER>That was the epicenter of the activity.

448
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,480
<17-2,RYAN>博伊尔女士  当你说活动时
<17-2,RYAN>Ms. Boyer, when you say activity...

449
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,790
<17-3,MARGARET>我们一开始也不信
<17-3,MARGARET>We didn't buy it either.

450
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,260
<17-3,MARGARET>我们听说过麦拉伦老宅的各种事
<17-3,MARGARET>We had heard all about the McClaren House,

451
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,360
<17-3,MARGARET>它的历史
<17-3,MARGARET>its history.

452
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,300
<17-3,MARGARET>我们置之一笑
<17-3,MARGARET>We laughed about it.

453
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,400
<17-4,HARRY BOYER>最开始  一切都很正常
<17-4,HARRY BOYER>At first, everything was fine.

454
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,520
<17-5,MARGARET>接着就开始了  灯忽明忽灭
<17-5,MARGARET>Then it started-- lights going off,

455
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,600
<17-5,MARGARET>奇怪的声响  门突然关上
<17-5,MARGARET>strange noises, doors slamming.

456
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,870
<17-6,CASTLE>有什么暴力的事发生吗
<17-6,CASTLE>Did anything violent ever happen?

457
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,010
<17-7,HARRY>有一天晚上
<17-7,HARRY>One night, uh,

458
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,570
<17-7,HARRY>我们听到客厅传来声响
<17-7,HARRY>we heard noises from the living room,

459
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,020
<17-7,HARRY>下楼去看
<17-7,HARRY>we went downstairs,

460
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,580
<17-7,HARRY>发现整个房间被捣毁了
<17-7,HARRY>found the whole room trashed.

461
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,150
<17-8,MARGARET>桌子翻了过来
<17-8,MARGARET>Tables flipped over,

462
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,440
<17-8,MARGARET>书撕得四分五裂  照片打得七零八落
<17-8,MARGARET>books ripped apart, pictures smashed.

463
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,000
<17-9,CASTLE>我的天啊  这太恐怖了
<17-9,CASTLE>Oh, my god. That's terrible.

464
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,640
<17-9,CASTLE>所以你们决定搬走了吗
<17-9,CASTLE>Is that when you decided to move out?

465
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,810
<17-10,HARRY>我们还是斗争了一番的
<17-10,HARRY>Not without a fight.

466
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,620
<17-10,HARRY>我们找到了那个女人  那个
<17-10,HARRY>We found this woman. This, um,

467
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,770
<17-10,HARRY>猎鬼人
<17-10,HARRY>ghost hunter.

468
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
<17-11,MARGARET>据说她是这行里最好的
<17-11,MARGARET>Said she was the best.

469
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,330
<17-11,MARGARET>其他的猎鬼人都向她寻求帮助
<17-11,MARGARET>Said all other ghost hunters came to her for help.

470
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,670
<17-11,MARGARET>可她来看了一眼  就叫我们火速搬走
<17-11,MARGARET>But she took one look, and told us to run like hell.

471
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,670
<17-12,HARRY>她叫什么名字
<17-12,HARRY>Yeah, what was her name?

472
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,390
<17-12,HARRY>梅夕
<17-12,HARRY>Um... Mercy.

473
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,430
<17-12,HARRY>没错  梅夕·兰格朗
<17-12,HARRY>That's right. Mercy Lagrande.

474
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,450
<17-13,CASTLE>梅夕  我看见了  梅夕
<17-13,CASTLE>"Mercy, I can see it. Mercy."

475
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,340
<17-14,RYAN>也许杰克·辛克莱死前
<17-14,RYAN>Maybe Jack Sinclair

476
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,960
<17-14,RYAN>并非在求凶手发慈悲呢
<17-14,RYAN>wasn't begging for mercy when he died.

477
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,500
<17-15,CASTLE>他是在叫她的名字
<17-15,CASTLE>He was saying her name.

478
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,870
<17-15,CASTLE>梅夕·兰格朗
<17-15,CASTLE>Mercy lagrande,

479
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,710
<18-1,BECKETT>本名叫做梅赛德斯·金
<18-1,BECKETT>real name, Mercedes King,

480
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,840
<18-1,BECKETT>经营一家没有执照的灵异咨询所
<18-1,BECKETT>runs an unlicensed business doing paranormal consultations.

481
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,730
<18-2,ESPOSITO>没营业执照是有原因的
<18-2,ESPOSITO>There's a reason why she's unlicensed.

482
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,260
<18-2,ESPOSITO>看看这个犯罪记录
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Check out this rap sheet.

483
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,290
<18-2,ESPOSITO>盗用他人身份  诈骗  支票诈骗
<18-2,ESPOSITO>We've got I.D. Theft, fraud, check fraud,

484
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,810
<18-2,ESPOSITO>还有假冒神职人员
<18-2,ESPOSITO>and impersonating a religious official.

485
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,840
<18-3,BECKETT>看看她办公的地点  38街和第9街
<18-3,BECKETT>Look at where her business is located--38th and 9th.

486
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,880
<18-4,ESPOSITO>正好是死者上计程车的同一街区
<18-4,ESPOSITO>That's on the same block our vic caught that cab.

487
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,280
<18-5,CASTLE>所以杰克去拜访了梅夕
<18-5,CASTLE>So Jack paid Mercy a visit,

488
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,470
<18-5,CASTLE>然后心烦意乱地去了麦拉伦老宅
<18-5,CASTLE>and then goes to the McClaren House upset.

489
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,250
<18-6,RYAN>几个小时后
<18-6,RYAN>Hours later,

490
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,620
<18-6,RYAN>死前还喊梅夕的名字
<18-6,RYAN>he says Mercy's name right before he dies.

491
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,490
<18-7,BECKETT>问题在于  她和这件事有什么关联
<18-7,BECKETT>So the question is, how is she involved in all of this?

492
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,330
<18-7,BECKETT>你知道
<18-7,BECKETT>Uh, well, you know, uh,

493
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,990
<18-8,CASTLE>如果你们忙着解决谋杀案的话
<18-8,CASTLE>Ryan and I would be glad to go check this out

494
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,110
<18-8,CASTLE>莱恩和我很愿意去查这件事
<18-8,CASTLE>if you guys are too busy solving that murder.

495
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,590
<19-1,MERCY>我已经尽我所能去帮助他了
<19-1,MERCY>I did what I could to help him,

496
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,890
<19-1,MERCY>可这些还不够
<19-1,MERCY>but I'd say it wasn't enough.

497
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,670
<19-2,CASTLE>杰克·辛克莱为什么要来见你
<19-2,CASTLE>Why did Jack Sinclair come to see you?

498
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,650
<19-3,MERCY>我曾经去过麦拉伦老宅
<19-3,MERCY>I've been in the McClaren House.

499
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,810
<19-3,MERCY>不管里面是什么  他要去见识一下
<19-3,MERCY>He was going to face whatever's in there,

500
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,370
<19-3,MERCY>于是他想听听我的意见
<19-3,MERCY>and he wanted my advice.

501
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,570
<19-4,BECKETT>你有偿地给了他建议
<19-4,BECKETT>Which you gave him... for a fee.

502
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,720
<19-5,MERCY>我可不是个江湖术士  探长
<19-5,MERCY>I'm not a charlatan, detective.

503
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,620
<19-5,MERCY>如果我是假把式  像杰克·辛克莱
<19-5,MERCY>Someone with Jack Sinclair's experience

504
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,980
<19-5,MERCY>这么专业的人是不会向我咨询的
<19-5,MERCY>wouldn't be seeking my counsel if I was.

505
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,950
<19-5,MERCY>请坐
<19-5,MERCY>Please.

506
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,110
<19-6,BECKETT>如果他那么厉害  为什么还要你帮忙
<19-6,BECKETT>If he was that good, why would he seek your help?

507
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,980
<19-7,MERCY>这对他来说不像其它的房子
<19-7,MERCY>This was not like any other house to him.

508
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,590
<19-7,MERCY>他接手这个任务的时候
<19-7,MERCY>When he took the assignment,

509
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,420
<19-7,MERCY>他就开始做梦
<19-7,MERCY>the dreams started.

510
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,580
<19-7,MERCY>开始只是些许碎片
<19-7,MERCY>Just glimpses at first,

511
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,100
<19-7,MERCY>房间里零零碎碎的东西
<19-7,MERCY>bits and pieces of a room,

512
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,630
<19-7,MERCY>可后来噩梦接踵而至
<19-7,MERCY>but then the dreams became nightmares--

513
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,610
<19-7,MERCY>人影  尸体
<19-7,MERCY>Figures, bodies.

514
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,930
<19-8,CASTLE>谁的尸体
<19-8,CASTLE>Whose bodies?

515
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,130
<19-8,CASTLE>他也不知道
<19-8,CASTLE>He didn't know.

516
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,420
<19-9,MERCY>可他说的越多
<19-9,MERCY>But the more we talked,

517
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,240
<19-9,MERCY>我越清楚  这些不是梦
<19-9,MERCY>the more it became clear to me, these weren't dreams.

518
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,520
<19-10,BECKETT>那是什么
<19-10,BECKETT>Well, what were they?

519
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,200
<19-11,MERCY>记忆
<19-11,MERCY>Memories.

520
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,660
<19-12,MERCY>他目睹了一场惨剧
<19-12,MERCY>He witnessed great evil.

521
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,980
<19-12,MERCY>这些年来一直压藏在记忆深处
<19-12,MERCY>Repressed it all these years.

522
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,790
<19-12,MERCY>可这些记忆太强大了
<19-12,MERCY>But the memories were too strong.

523
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,580
<19-12,MERCY>它们不断浮现出来
<19-12,MERCY>They were coming back.

524
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,670
<19-13,BECKETT>那他具体记起了什么
<19-13,BECKETT>And what was he remembering exactly?

525
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,160
<19-14,MERCY>一个女人
<19-14,MERCY>A woman,

526
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,460
<19-14,MERCY>血流成河  一个持刀的男人
<19-14,MERCY>a lot of blood, a man with a knife.

527
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,900
<19-15,CASTLE>那个男人是谁
<19-15,CASTLE>Who was the man?

528
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,410
<19-16,MERCY>他说那张脸很模糊  可逐渐清晰起来
<19-16,MERCY>He said the face was blurred but getting clearer.

529
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,990
<19-16,MERCY>我告诉他
<19-16,MERCY>I told him,

530
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,580
<19-16,MERCY>如果他回到凶案发生的房间
<19-16,MERCY>if he returned to the room where it happened,

531
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,720
<19-16,MERCY>或许他就能想起来
<19-16,MERCY>it might all come back to him.

532
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,300
<19-17,CASTLE>"梅夕  我看见了"  指的是凶手的脸
<19-17,CASTLE>"Mercy, I can see it." That's the murderer's face.

533
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:17,750
<19-18,BECKETT>杰克在遇害前刚好恢复了记忆
<19-18,BECKETT>Jack recovered the memory just before he was killed.

534
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,450
<19-19,CASTLE>那栋房子里发生的上一起命案是在20年前
<19-19,CASTLE>The last murder in that house was 20 years ago.

535
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,510
<19-19,CASTLE>我读过案宗了
<19-19,CASTLE>I read about the case.

536
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,280
<19-19,CASTLE>没有目击者
<19-19,CASTLE>There were no witnesses.

537
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,580
<19-20,MERCY>其实有一个
<19-20,MERCY>Oh, there was one.

538
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,500
<19-20,MERCY>杰克·辛克莱当时在场
<19-20,MERCY>Jack Sinclair was there

539
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,400
<19-20,MERCY>就在那个女人遇害当晚
<19-20,MERCY>the night that woman died.

540
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,490
<19-20,MERCY>他在场
<19-20,MERCY>He was there.

541
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,640
<20-1,ESPOSITO>这些图片血肉模糊
<20-1,ESPOSITO>The pictures aren't pretty.

542
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,550
<20-1,ESPOSITO>梅兰妮·本顿
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Melanie Benton,

543
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,760
<20-1,ESPOSITO>1991年4月20日晚
<20-1,ESPOSITO>sliced up in the McClaren house

544
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,330
<20-1,ESPOSITO>在麦拉伦老宅被捅多刀而死
<20-1,ESPOSITO>on the night of April 20, 1991.

545
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,750
<20-1,ESPOSITO>你们猜她是在哪里被发现的
<20-1,ESPOSITO>One guess where she was found.

546
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,640
<20-2,CASTLE>客厅
<20-2,CASTLE>The living room.

547
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,510
<20-3,ESPOSITO>你真行
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Give that man a prize.

548
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,570
<20-4,CASTLE>那1991年  杰克·辛克莱多大  11岁吗
<20-4,CASTLE>So 1991, Jack Sinclair is what, 11?

549
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,040
<20-4,CASTLE>还住在那附近
<20-4,CASTLE>Still living in the neighborhood.

550
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,450
<20-4,CASTLE>我打赌他目睹的就是这起凶案
<20-4,CASTLE>I'm betting this is the murder he witnessed.

551
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,130
<20-5,BECKETT>是啊  可他是怎么目睹凶案
<20-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but how did he witness a murder

552
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,510
<20-5,BECKETT>却没让凶手发现呢
<20-5,BECKETT>without the killer knowing?

553
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,430
<20-6,RYAN>我做了调查  杰克当时送报
<20-6,RYAN>I did some digging. Jack had a paper route,

554
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,840
<20-6,RYAN>麦拉伦老宅是其中一户
<20-6,RYAN>and the McClaren House was on it.

555
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,400
<20-7,CASTLE>那杰克或许是去收钱的
<20-7,CASTLE>Okay, so Jack shows up, maybe to collect money,

556
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,800
<20-7,CASTLE>听到了惨叫  然后通过窗户往里偷看
<20-7,CASTLE>hears screams, and he peers in through those windows.

557
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,520
<20-7,CASTLE>那些他看到的情景  在多年后的
<20-7,CASTLE>He started having dreams about what he'd seen

558
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,280
<20-7,CASTLE>梦中出现  他想知道这梦境到底怎么回事
<20-7,CASTLE>all those years ago, and he wanted to make sense of them.

559
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,420
<20-8,ESPOSITO>所以死者才会雇朗·博格破门而入
<20-8,ESPOSITO>And that's why our vic hired Ron Berger to break in

560
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,680
<20-8,ESPOSITO>拍下客厅的照片
<20-8,ESPOSITO>and take pictures of the living room.

561
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,190
<20-9,BECKETT>凶手被逮捕了吗
<20-9,BECKETT>Was there ever an arrest made?

562
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,200
<20-10,RYAN>没  所以说凶手还逍遥法外
<20-10,RYAN>No, which means the killer is still out there.

563
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,710
<20-11,CASTLE>杰克·辛克莱快恢复记忆了
<20-11,CASTLE>So Jack Sinclair is just about to recover his memory

564
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,110
<20-11,CASTLE>并可能指证出凶手的身份
<20-11,CASTLE>and possibly I.D. our killer,

565
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,630
<20-11,CASTLE>紧接着就被灭口了
<20-11,CASTLE>and he's silenced.

566
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,740
<20-12,BECKETT>当时谁负责调查此案
<20-12,BECKETT>Who was the investigating officer on the case?

567
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,990
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>我都已经退休十年了
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>I've been retired ten years,

568
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,910
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>还惦记着这起案子
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>and I still think about this one.

569
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,130
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>我第一个到达案发现场
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>I was the first one on the scene,

570
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,260
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>我得告诉你们  照片没能体现现场有多糟糕
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>and I gotta tell you, the pictures don't even do it justice,

571
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,380
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>马特·本顿对他妻子犯下的罪行让人作呕
<21-1,DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH>what Matt Benton did to his poor wife.

572
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,400
<21-2,BECKETT>马特·本顿  你认为梅兰妮是被
<21-2,BECKETT>Matt Benton? You think that Melanie was killed

573
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,400
<21-2,BECKETT>自己的老公所杀
<21-2,BECKETT>by her own husband?

574
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,620
<21-3,SMITH>邻居一直在抱怨他们吵个不停
<21-3,SMITH>Well, the neighbors complained about constant fighting.

575
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,080
<21-3,SMITH>梅兰妮遇害当晚
<21-3,SMITH>We put out an A.P.B. on benton

576
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,260
<21-3,SMITH>我们就对本顿做了全面通缉
<21-3,SMITH>the night that Melanie was murdered,

577
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,670
<21-3,SMITH>可他溜了  潜逃至今
<21-3,SMITH>but he got away, and he's been on the lam ever since

578
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,560
<21-3,SMITH>很明显他就是凶手
<21-3,SMITH>so it doesn't take a genius to put it together.

579
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,190
<21-4,BECKETT>他失踪后  你听说过他的下落吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Did you ever hear anything about his whereabouts after he disappeared?

580
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,570
<21-5,SMITH>我们只接到过一次消息  说他在欧洲
<21-5,SMITH>We got one tip once about him being in Europe.

581
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,840
<21-5,SMITH>不过那是15年前的事了
<21-5,SMITH>But that--that's gotta be a good 15 years ago now.

582
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,960
<21-6,CASTLE>有人看到他了吗
<21-6,CASTLE>So somebody spotted him?

583
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,860
<21-7,SMITH>不  他寄了明信片给他哥哥
<21-7,SMITH>No, he sent postcards to his brother.

584
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,490
<21-7,SMITH>上面盖着维也纳的邮戳
<21-7,SMITH>They were postmarked Vienna.

585
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,410
<21-8,CASTLE>上面写了什么  你还记得吗
<21-8,CASTLE>What did they say? Do you remember?

586
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,930
<21-9,SMITH>说来说去都是一件事
<21-9,SMITH>They all said the same thing--

587
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,220
<21-9,SMITH>本顿声称他没有杀死他妻子
<21-9,SMITH>Benton claimed he wasn't responsible for his wife's death,

588
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,790
<21-9,SMITH>说什么跟恶鬼有关
<21-9,SMITH>something about a demon.

589
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,650
<21-10,CASTLE>真的吗  他声称和恶鬼有关
<21-10,CASTLE>Really? He claimed there was a demon involved?

590
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,200
<21-11,SMITH>是啊  还真以为有人会相信他
<21-11,SMITH>I know. Like anyone's gonna fall for that, right?

591
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,070
<21-11,SMITH>他以为跟他打交道的都是白痴吗
<21-11,SMITH>I mean, what kind of jackass did he think he was dealing with?

592
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,420
<21-12,BECKETT>你追查过那些明信片的线索吗
<21-12,BECKETT>Did you ever follow up on any of those postcards,

593
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,430
<21-12,BECKETT>史密斯警探
<21-12,BECKETT>Detective Smith?

594
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,670
<21-13,SMITH>我们找了国际刑警帮忙
<21-13,SMITH>We got interpol involved,

595
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,640
<21-13,SMITH>可没有确凿的证据对他不利
<21-13,SMITH>but without any hard evidence against the guy--

596
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,630
<21-13,SMITH>没有凶器  没有证人
<21-13,SMITH>No murder weapon, no witness-- you know,

597
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,610
<21-13,SMITH>我觉得他们没把这案子当回事儿
<21-13,SMITH>I don't think they ever took it too seriously.

598
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,530
<21-14,BECKETT>那如果现在有个证人站出来呢
<21-14,BECKETT>And what if a witness came forward now,

599
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,050
<21-14,BECKETT>会有变化吗
<21-14,BECKETT>would that change anything?

600
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,550
<21-15,SMITH>会改变一切
<21-15,SMITH>That would change everything.

601
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,060
<22-1,CASTLE>越来越像是马特·本顿知晓了杰克的事
<22-1,CASTLE>It sounds more and more like Matt Benton found out about Jack

602
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,480
<22-1,CASTLE>决定杀人灭口
<22-1,CASTLE>and decided to keep him quiet.

603
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,770
<22-2,BECKETT>可马特是怎么发现
<22-2,BECKETT>But how did Matt find out

604
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,670
<22-2,BECKETT>杰克正在恢复记忆的
<22-2,BECKETT>that Jack was recovering his memories?

605
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,660
<22-3,ESPOSITO>我有个想法
<22-3,ESPOSITO>I have an idea about that.

606
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,410
<22-3,ESPOSITO>我刚在查死者的电话记录
<22-3,ESPOSITO>I was rechecking our vic's phone records.

607
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,230
<22-3,ESPOSITO>发现杰克·辛克莱死前一周
<22-3,ESPOSITO>It turns out, a week before he died,

608
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,210
<22-3,ESPOSITO>曾打电话
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Jack Sinclair called

609
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,580
<22-3,ESPOSITO>给洛哈特&威兰&本顿律师事务所
<22-3,ESPOSITO>the law firm of Lockhart, Whelan and Benton.

610
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,820
<22-4,CASTLE>本顿  是...
<22-4,CASTLE>Benton? As in--

611
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,600
<22-5,ESPOSITO>彼得·本顿  马特的哥哥
<22-5,ESPOSITO>Pete Benton, Matt's brother.

612
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,620
<22-6,BECKETT>马特的明信片就是寄给他的...
<22-6,BECKETT>That's the brother that Matt was sending those postcards to and--

613
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,680
<22-7,CASTLE>彼得很有可能警告马特
<22-7,CASTLE>Pete could have easily alerted Matt

614
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,250
<22-7,CASTLE>有人在问问题
<22-7,CASTLE>that someone was asking questions,

615
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,710
<22-7,CASTLE>不该问的问题
<22-7,CASTLE>the wrong kind of questions.

616
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,810
<23-1,PETE BENTON>我弟弟十五年前寄了那些明信片给我
<23-1,PETE BENTON>My brother sent me those postcards over 15 years ago.

617
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,610
<23-1,PETE BENTON>我都交给警察了  从那以后就没他的消息了
<23-1,PETE BENTON>I gave them to the cops. I haven't heard from him since.

618
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,800
<23-2,BECKETT>从那时起就没联系过吗  本顿先生
<23-2,BECKETT>And no contact since then, Mr. Benton?

619
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,460
<23-3,PETE>没
<23-3,PETE>No.

620
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,850
<23-4,BECKETT>和杰克·辛克莱聊过后也没有吗
<23-4,BECKETT>Not even after talking to Jack Sinclair?

621
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,490
<23-5,PETE>杰克·辛克莱是谁
<23-5,PETE>Jack Sinclair?

622
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,520
<23-6,CASTLE>那个猎鬼人
<23-6,CASTLE>The ghost hunter.

623
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,880
<23-6,CASTLE>他昨晚在麦拉伦老宅里被杀了
<23-6,CASTLE>He was killed in the McClaren house last night.

624
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,440
<23-7,PETE>我从没和杰克·辛克莱联系过
<23-7,PETE>I never spoke to Jack Sinclair.

625
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,550
<23-8,BECKETT>可他的电话记录却证明你们说过话
<23-8,BECKETT>Well, his phone records show otherwise.

626
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
<23-9,PETE>我每年都收到些电视制片人的电话
<23-9,PETE>I get calls every year from some TV producer

627
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,910
<23-9,PETE>打听我们家族的不幸
<23-9,PETE>looking to exploit my family's tragedy

628
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,440
<23-9,PETE>和麦拉伦老宅的传说
<23-9,PETE>and the legend of the McClaren mansion.

629
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,090
<23-9,PETE>不管这个人遭遇了什么不测  我深感遗憾
<23-9,PETE>Look, it's a shame, whatever happened to this guy.

630
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,900
<23-9,PETE>可如果他打来电话  不是我跟他通的话
<23-9,PETE>But if he called here, I did not talk to him.

631
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,690
<23-9,PETE>我当然也没和我弟弟有过联系
<23-9,PETE>And I certainly haven't spoken to my brother.

632
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,520
<23-10,CASTLE>那如果我们检查你的通话记录
<23-10,CASTLE>So if we check your phone records,

633
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,260
<23-10,CASTLE>查不到打到维也纳的通话记录
<23-10,CASTLE>we won't find calls to Vienna?

634
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,540
<23-11,PETE>我们是一家国际律师事务所
<23-11,PETE>We're an international law firm.

635
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,880
<23-11,PETE>我们的客户遍及欧洲  包括维也纳
<23-11,PETE>We have clients all over Europe, including Vienna.

636
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,670
<23-12,BECKETT>我们要查看你们的通话记录
<23-12,BECKETT>We're gonna need access to those phone logs.

637
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,760
<23-13,PETE>那你们需要搜查令
<23-13,PETE>Then you need a warrant,

638
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,840
<23-13,PETE>而你们没有足够的证据去申请
<23-13,PETE>and you don't have enough to get one.

639
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,080
<23-14,SECRETARY>本顿先生  您的车到楼下了
<23-14,SECRETARY>Mr. Benton, your car is downstairs.

640
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,370
<24-1,RYAN>为事务所提供租车服务的是乐驾公司
<24-1,RYAN>The law firm's car service of choice is Execu-drive.

641
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,670
<24-1,RYAN>这些是彼得·本顿的账单明细
<24-1,RYAN>Here are Pete Benton's billing slips

642
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,930
<24-1,RYAN>差不多是这一个月左右的
<24-1,RYAN>going back a month or so.

643
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,280
<24-2,BECKETT>有没有什么异常活动
<24-2,BECKETT>Was there any unusual activity?

644
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,390
<24-3,RYAN>日常路线就是上下班这段路
<24-3,RYAN>Uh, daily routine's the same to and from work,

645
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
<24-3,RYAN>可是四天前
<24-3,RYAN>except for four days ago,

646
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,750
<24-3,RYAN>彼得批准车辆去肯尼迪机场接人
<24-3,RYAN>when Pete authorized a pickup at J.F.K.,

647
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,040
<24-3,RYAN>在国际航班候机楼
<24-3,RYAN>international terminal.

648
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,490
<24-4,BECKETT>那或许彼得真的和弟弟有联络
<24-4,BECKETT>Okay. So maybe Pete did have his brother on speed dial.

649
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,210
<24-4,BECKETT>他们去了哪里
<24-4,BECKETT>Where'd they go?

650
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,360
<24-5,RYAN>法威克酒店
<24-5,RYAN>Fairwyck Hotel.

651
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,810
<24-6,BECKETT>我们把照片拿到法威克去
<24-6,BECKETT>All right, let's take this down to the Fairwyck

652
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,240
<24-6,BECKETT>看看有谁认得出马特·本顿
<24-6,BECKETT>and see if anybody recognizes Matt Benton.

653
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,100
<24-7,ESPOSITO>我让技术组搞了张合成的推测图
<24-7,ESPOSITO>Actually, I had tech mock up an aged-up version of the photo,

654
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,130
<24-7,ESPOSITO>20年后的马特
<24-7,ESPOSITO>you know, Matt 20 years later.

655
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,060
<24-9,BECKETT>等等  你们今晚不是有饭局吗
<24-9,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Don't you guys have dinner plans tonight?

656
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,350
<24-10,RYAN>我们可以改到
<24-10,RYAN>Uh, we can move it to...

657
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,770
<24-10,RYAN>某个蕾妮不连班的晚上出去
<24-10,RYAN>some night when Lanie's not coming off a double shift.

658
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,910
<24-11,ESPOSITO>实际上  蕾妮已经期盼很久了
<24-11,ESPOSITO>Uh, actually, Lanie's really looking forward to it.

659
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,190
<24-12,BECKETT>别担心  我回家顺道去一趟
<24-12,BECKETT>You know what? No worries. It's on my way home.

660
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,710
<24-13,RYAN>确定吗
<24-13,RYAN>You sure?

661
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,840
<24-14,ESPOSITO>确定我不想成为毁掉
<24-14,ESPOSITO>That I don't want to be the one to blame

662
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,630
<24-15,BECKETT>蕾妮美好夜晚的人吗  没错  我确定
<24-15,BECKETT>for ruining Lanie's night out? Oh, yeah. I am sure.

663
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,030
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>说实话  理查德
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Honestly, Richard,

664
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,600
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>你读一本关于百年老宅的书
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>how do you plan to solve a 1-day-old murder

665
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,820
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>对解决刚发生一天的凶案有什么帮助啊
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>by reading a book about a 100-year-old house?

666
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,500
<25-2,CASTLE>你这话听起来像贝克特
<25-2,CASTLE>You sound just like Beckett.

667
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,360
<25-3,CASTLE>这些事件都恰好发生在客厅  一定是
<25-3,CASTLE>There has to be a reason why all these things happened

668
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,190
<25-3,CASTLE>有原因的
<25-3,CASTLE>in the living room--

669
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,540
<25-3,CASTLE>所有这些谋杀
<25-3,CASTLE>All these murders, uh,

670
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,570
<25-3,CASTLE>房客的家具  都在同一间房间
<25-3,CASTLE>the tenants who had their furniture smashed,

671
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,220
<25-3,CASTLE>被弄个粉碎
<25-3,CASTLE>all in the same room.

672
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,340
<25-4,MARTHA>也许是你们的恶鬼
<25-4,MARTHA>Maybe that demon of yours

673
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,790
<25-4,MARTHA>不喜欢那家具
<25-4,MARTHA>did not like the furniture.

674
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,330
<25-4,MARTHA>你找个家装师  把那装饰一新
<25-4,MARTHA>You bring in a decorator, snazz up the place...

675
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,970
<25-4,MARTHA>这些怪事也许就都打住了
<25-4,MARTHA>All this nonsense might stop.

676
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,130
<25-5,CASTLE>这话不像贝克特
<25-5,CASTLE>Less like Beckett.

677
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,610
<25-6,CASTLE>咱这不必再装饰了
<25-6,CASTLE>No need of snazzing up here.

678
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
<25-6,CASTLE>瞧瞧你
<25-6,CASTLE>Look at you. Wow.

679
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,040
<25-7,CASTLE>和阿什利视频  你还真的打扮一番啊
<25-7,CASTLE>You're really taking these skype dates with Ashley seriously.

680
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,520
<25-8,ALEXIS>我是要去参加派对
<25-8,ALEXIS>I'm going to a party.

681
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,850
<25-8,ALEXIS>阿什几小时前就该打给我的
<25-8,ALEXIS>Ash was supposed to call me hours ago,

682
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,950
<25-8,ALEXIS>但是我等烦了
<25-8,ALEXIS>but I'm tired of waiting.

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,630
<25-9,CASTLE>出去玩玩挺好  亲爱的
<25-9,CASTLE>Oh, good for you, sweetheart.

684
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,610
<25-9,CASTLE>玩的开心
<25-9,CASTLE>Have a good time.

685
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,590
<25-10,ALEXIS>谢谢  爸爸  我午夜前会回来
<25-10,ALEXIS>Thanks, dad. I'll be back by midnight.

686
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,220
<25-11,CASTLE>多谢
<25-11,CASTLE>Thank you.

687
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,140
<25-12,ALEXIS>回见
<25-12,ALEXIS>Bye.

688
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,910
<25-13,CASTLE>你看见她那身打扮了吗  我该担心吗
<25-13,CASTLE>Did you see that outfit? Should I be worried?

689
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,000
<25-14,MARTHA>阿什利才是该担心的人
<25-14,MARTHA>Ashley's the one who should be worried.

690
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,850
<25-14,MARTHA>相信我  如果他看见她现在出门的样子
<25-14,MARTHA>Trust me, if he could see how she looked going out now,

691
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,260
<25-14,MARTHA>他就不会那么让她干等着
<25-14,MARTHA>he wouldn't be so quick to leave her hanging.

692
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,690
<25-15,MARTHA>是不是很搞笑  阿什利打来的
<25-15,MARTHA>Oh, isn't this funny? It's Ashley.

693
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,920
<25-15,MARTHA>拒接
<25-15,MARTHA>Decline.

694
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,970
<25-15,MARTHA>就好像是他在偷听我们的对话
<25-15,MARTHA>It's almost as if he was listening in to our conversation.

695
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
<25-16,CASTLE>偷听
<25-16,CASTLE>Listening in.

696
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,260
<25-16,CASTLE>麦拉伦老宅的建筑师
<25-16,CASTLE>The architect for the McClaren House,

697
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,610
<25-16,CASTLE>是苏格兰人
<25-16,CASTLE>he's from Scotland.

698
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,860
<25-17,MARTHA>这很重要吗
<25-17,MARTHA>I-Is that important?

699
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,150
<25-18,CASTLE>这是关键
<25-18,CASTLE>It's the key.

700
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,720
<26-1,CASTLE>两个词
<26-1,CASTLE>Two words--

701
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,050
<26-2,BECKETT>主人的耳朵
<26-2,BECKETT>Laird's lug.

702
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,510
<26-2,BECKETT>主人的耳朵
<26-2,BECKETT>Laird's lug?

703
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,070
<26-3,CASTLE>也就是"房东的耳朵"
<26-3,CASTLE>Literally "lord's ear."

704
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,680
<26-3,CASTLE>指的是许多苏格兰城堡里
<26-3,CASTLE>It refers to the hidden alcove above a dining hall

705
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,370
<26-3,CASTLE>餐厅上方都设有密室
<26-3,CASTLE>of many Scottish castles.

706
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,230
<26-3,CASTLE>屋主用它来偷听客人的谈话
<26-3,CASTLE>The host could use it to eavesdrop on his guests.

707
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,250
<26-4,BECKETT>我想我要么是喝多了  要么还得再喝
<26-4,BECKETT>I think I've either had too much wine or not enough.

708
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,890
<26-5,CASTLE>西莫斯·麦拉伦  麦拉伦老宅的建筑师
<26-5,CASTLE>Seamus McClaren, builder of the McClaren house,

709
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,020
<26-5,CASTLE>紧挨着爱丁堡城堡长大
<26-5,CASTLE>grew up right next to Edinburgh castle,

710
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,820
<26-5,CASTLE>对主人的耳朵再熟悉不过了
<26-5,CASTLE>notable for its laird's lug.

711
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,120
<26-5,CASTLE>这个设计使他如此着迷
<26-5,CASTLE>The concept so tickled him,

712
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,470
<26-5,CASTLE>于是他将现代版的偷听密室
<26-5,CASTLE>he put modern versions of it

713
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,590
<26-5,CASTLE>放进了他设计的几座楼房中
<26-5,CASTLE>into several of his houses.

714
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,370
<26-6,BECKETT>你是说麦拉伦老宅
<26-6,BECKETT>So you're saying that the McClaren House

715
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,700
<26-6,BECKETT>有一个密室
<26-6,BECKETT>has a hidden alcove?

716
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,520
<26-7,CASTLE>这就解释了一切
<26-7,CASTLE>It explains everything.

717
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,280
<26-7,CASTLE>谋杀怎么会都发生在同一间屋子
<26-7,CASTLE>How come the killings only happen in that one room?

718
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,960
<26-7,CASTLE>凶手怎么可以随意出现又消失
<26-7,CASTLE>How does the killer seemingly appear and disappear at will?

719
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,450
<26-7,CASTLE>这些答案目前还有待查实
<26-7,CASTLE>Answers that have, thus far, remained elusive.

720
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,650
<26-8,CASTLE>说到这个  你的排查怎么样了
<26-8,CASTLE>Speaking of which, how did your canvassing go?

721
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,100
<26-9,BECKETT>一无所获
<26-9,BECKETT>I came up empty.

722
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,180
<26-9,BECKETT>完全没有证据显示马特·本顿
<26-9,BECKETT>There's absolutely no evidence that Matt Benton

723
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,630
<26-9,BECKETT>曾去过法威克
<26-9,BECKETT>was ever at the Fairwyck.

724
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,130
<26-10,CASTLE>也许他人已经回来的证据
<26-10,CASTLE>Maybe the evidence of his return

725
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,920
<26-10,CASTLE>就藏在那密室里
<26-10,CASTLE>will be in that alcove.

726
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,300
<26-10,CASTLE>值得一试
<26-10,CASTLE>It's worth a shot.

727
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,350
<26-11,BECKETT>我们明早去瞧瞧
<26-11,BECKETT>We'll go first thing in the morning,

728
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
<26-11,BECKETT>看看会有什么发现
<26-11,BECKETT>see what we come up with.

729
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,480
<26-12,BECKETT>你现在就想去
<26-12,BECKETT>You want to go now?

730
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,650
<26-13,CASTLE>当然了  除非你害怕
<26-13,CASTLE>Well, unless, of course, you're afraid.

731
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,140
<26-15,CASTLE>-才不  -不  我明白
<26-15,CASTLE>- Yeah, right. - No, I get it.

732
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,240
<26-15,CASTLE>那屋子闹鬼
<26-15,CASTLE>I mean, it is a haunted house.

733
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,400
<26-16,BECKETT>我不怕  卡塞尔
<26-16,BECKETT>I'm not scared, Castle.

734
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,310
<26-16,BECKETT>不不  你说得对
<26-16,BECKETT>No, no, you're right.

735
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,970
<26-17,CASTLE>你说得对  恶鬼已经尝过鲜血的甜美了
<26-17,CASTLE>You're right. I mean, the demon has tasted fresh blood.

736
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,030
<26-17,CASTLE>它的嗜血
<26-17,CASTLE>Its--its thirst may not

737
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,910
<26-17,CASTLE>是一个被害人所不能满足的
<26-17,CASTLE>be slaked with just one victim.

738
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,520
<26-18,BECKETT>好吧  行了
<26-18,BECKETT>Okay, come on.

739
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,400
<26-19,CASTLE>如果你不害怕
<26-19,CASTLE>Listen, if-- if you're not scared,

740
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,580
<26-19,CASTLE>-就说出来  -不要
<26-19,CASTLE>- Just say it. - No.

741
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,350
<26-21,CASTLE>拜托  你明明想说
<26-21,CASTLE>Come on. You know you want to.

742
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,780
<26-22,BECKETT>我不想说  卡塞尔
<26-22,BECKETT>I don't want to say it, Castle.

743
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,820
<26-23,CASTLE>就算为了我  求你
<26-23,CASTLE>For me. Please.

744
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,050
<26-24,BECKETT>我才不怕什么鬼魂
<26-24,BECKETT>I ain't afraid a' no ghosts.

746
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,430
<26-24,BECKETT>多谢
<26-24,BECKETT>Thank you.

747
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,230
<27-1,BECKETT>我不确定  卡塞尔  多年来这里发生了
<27-1,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle, there have been a lot of murder investigations

748
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,470
<27-1,BECKETT>多起谋杀案
<27-1,BECKETT>in here over the years,

749
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,860
<27-1,BECKETT>我想如果这里真有密室
<27-1,BECKETT>And I think they would've found a secret room

750
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,110
<27-1,BECKETT>应该早就有人发现了
<27-1,BECKETT>if there actually was one.

751
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,510
<27-2,CASTLE>如果它隐蔽得好  就不会
<27-2,CASTLE>Not if it was hidden well enough.

752
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,940
<27-3,BECKETT>如果我们真找到这间房  你会后悔的
<27-3,BECKETT>You know, you're gonna regret it if we actually find this room.

753
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,570
<27-4,CASTLE>为什么
<27-4,CASTLE>Why is that?

754
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,020
<27-5,BECKETT>因为那样你就得承认
<27-5,BECKETT>Because then you're gonna have to admit

755
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,260
<27-5,BECKETT>幕后黑手不是什么恶鬼
<27-5,BECKETT>that there is no demon behind all of this.

756
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,410
<27-5,BECKETT>只不过是藏在密室里
<27-5,BECKETT>It's nothing more than

757
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,180
<27-5,BECKETT>无聊年迈的变态杀手
<27-5,BECKETT>a boring old psycho killer hiding in a room.

758
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,050
<27-6,CASTLE>除非是个被恶鬼附身的变态杀手
<27-6,CASTLE>Well, unless it's a psycho killer possessed by a demon.

759
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,080
<27-6,CASTLE>你为何这么坚定地
<27-6,CASTLE>Why are you so determined

760
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,640
<27-7,BECKETT>要在其中找到超自然的存在
<27-7,BECKETT>to find the supernatural in all this?

761
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,910
<27-8,CASTLE>你为何这么坚定地不相信呢
<27-8,CASTLE>Why are you so determined not to?

762
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,280
<27-9,BECKETT>你知道吗  证据指向哪里
<27-9,BECKETT>You know what? I am just following the evidence

763
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,090
<27-9,BECKETT>我就会顺其追查
<27-9,BECKETT>wherever it may lead,

764
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,980
<27-9,BECKETT>而作为一名警察  我会考虑
<27-9,BECKETT>And as a cop, I'm going to consider

765
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,610
<27-9,BECKETT>这世上所有可能存在的解释
<27-9,BECKETT>every possible worldly explanation.

766
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,930
<27-10,CASTLE>要是没有呢
<27-10,CASTLE>And what if there is none?

767
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,890
<27-11,BECKETT>那我会考虑其他可能性
<27-11,BECKETT>Well, then I'm open to the alternatives.

768
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,200
<27-12,CASTLE>-你会相信妖魔鬼怪  -你知道吗
<27-12,CASTLE>- You, skepticism maximum? - You know what?

769
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,440
<27-13,BECKETT>就因为我不常把它挂在嘴边
<27-13,BECKETT>Just because I don't talk about it nonstop

770
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,500
<27-13,BECKETT>不代表我不相信它的存在
<27-13,BECKETT>doesn't mean I don't believe in another plane.

771
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,220
<27-13,BECKETT>我还亲身经历过呢
<27-13,BECKETT>I've actually had my own experiences.

772
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,250
<27-14,CASTLE>胡说  比如呢
<27-14,CASTLE>Get out. Like what?

773
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,090
<27-15,BECKETT>当我还是个小女孩的时候
<27-15,BECKETT>When I was a little girl,

774
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,420
<27-15,BECKETT>我父母在湖边租了个小木屋
<27-15,BECKETT>My parents rented a cabin by a lake,

775
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,250
<27-15,BECKETT>有天晚上  我要去洗手间
<27-15,BECKETT>And one night, I had to go to the bathroom...

776
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,690
<27-15,BECKETT>算了  你只会觉得我疯了
<27-15,BECKETT>You know what? You're just gonna think I'm crazy.

777
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,190
<27-16,CASTLE>不不不  继续说  告诉我吧
<27-16,CASTLE>No, no, no. Go ahead. Tell me.

778
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,650
<27-17,BECKETT>就在去的路上
<27-17,BECKETT>and on the way there,

779
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,140
<27-17,BECKETT>我听到一个声音在低语
<27-17,BECKETT>I heard this... voice whispering...

780
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,040
<27-17,BECKETT>叫着"凯特  凯特"
<27-17,BECKETT>"Kate, Kate."

781
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,970
<27-17,BECKETT>声音是从房东锁住的那件房间传出来的
<27-17,BECKETT>it was coming from this room that the owners had locked up

782
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,560
<27-17,BECKETT>房东告诉我父母  绝不要进那间房
<27-17,BECKETT>and told my parents... never to go in it.

783
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,440
<27-17,BECKETT>可那天晚上  门缝里发出奇怪的光
<27-17,BECKETT>except that night, There's this weird glow underneath the door,

784
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,840
<27-17,BECKETT>然后我又听到那个声音
<27-17,BECKETT>and then I heard the voice again.

785
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,240
<27-17,BECKETT>"凯特"
<27-17,BECKETT>"Kate."

786
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,990
<27-17,BECKETT>我走到门边
<27-17,BECKETT>and so I walked up to the door

787
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,050
<27-17,BECKETT>这时候  门却没有锁
<27-17,BECKETT>And this time, it wasn't locked.

788
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,920
<27-17,BECKETT>我扭开门把手  推开门  我看见了
<27-17,BECKETT>and I turned the doorknob and I opened it up and then I saw it.

789
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,610
<27-18,CASTLE>什么  你看见了什么
<27-18,CASTLE>What was it? What did you see?

790
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,730
<27-19,CASTLE>真好笑啊
<27-19,CASTLE>Ah, ha ha. Very funny.

791
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,470
<27-19,CASTLE>你唬住我了
<27-19,CASTLE>Yes, you got me.

792
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,200
<27-20,BECKETT>你认识我多久了  卡塞尔
<27-20,BECKETT>How long have you known me, Castle?

793
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,370
<27-20,BECKETT>我当然不相信有妖魔鬼怪
<27-20,BECKETT>Of course I don't believe in ghosts.

794
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,430
<27-21,CASTLE>那怎么回事
<27-21,CASTLE>What was that?

795
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,250
<27-22,BECKETT>太奇怪了
<27-22,BECKETT>Well, that's odd.

796
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,570
<27-23,CASTLE>不  可不仅仅是奇怪
<27-23,CASTLE>No, that's more than just odd.

797
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,760
<27-23,CASTLE>这与杰克·辛克莱被杀时
<27-23,CASTLE>This is the same sequence of events

798
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,570
<27-23,CASTLE>发生的事情一样
<27-23,CASTLE>that preceeded Jack Sinclair's murder.

799
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,590
<27-24,BECKETT>可杰克当时手里只有个电磁仪
<27-24,BECKETT>Except Jack only had an E.M.F. Meter.

800
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,290
<27-24,BECKETT>而我有枪和电筒
<27-24,BECKETT>I've got a gun and a flashlight.

801
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,940
<27-25,CASTLE>没电的电筒
<27-25,CASTLE>With dead batteries.

802
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,330
<27-26,BECKETT>我记得我刚换了新的电池
<27-26,BECKETT>I could swear I just put in new ones.

803
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,860
<27-27,BECKETT>我刚看到蜡烛边有些火柴
<27-27,BECKETT>I know I saw some matches by one of these candles here.

804
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,960
<27-28,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  有点大叔样行不  -抱歉
<27-28,BECKETT>- Wow, Castle. Mature. - Right. Sorry.

808
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,490
<27-33,BECKETT>好吧  也许是穿堂风
<27-33,BECKETT>Okay. So maybe there's a draft here.

<27-34,BECKETT>把我举起来
<27-34,BECKETT>Give me a boost.

<27-41,CASTLE>That's the noise on the tape

818
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,720
<27-41,CASTLE>就在杰克·辛克莱被杀之前
<27-41,CASTLE>Right before Jack Sinclair was killed.

819
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,090

<29-3,CASTLE>凶手撕裂杰克·辛克莱的喉咙时
<29-3,CASTLE>The killer could have hung upside down from this bar

847
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,850
<29-3,CASTLE>可能就倒挂在在横梁上
<29-3,CASTLE>when he slit Jack Sinclair's throat.

848
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,770

<30-1,BECKETT>Hidden passageways, secret rooms?

859
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,390
<30-1,BECKETT>我不明白了  卡塞尔
<30-1,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle.

860
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,990
<30-1,BECKETT>麦拉伦老宅的神秘之感
<30-1,BECKETT>The mystery of the McClaren Mansion's

861
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,210
<30-1,BECKETT>每分钟都在退却
<30-1,BECKETT>looking less supernatural by the minute.

862
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,250
<30-2,CASTLE>这是什么
<30-2,CASTLE>What is this?

863
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,010
<30-3,CASTLE>它是个磁场发生器
<30-3,CASTLE>It's a magnetic field generator,

864
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,700
<30-3,CASTLE>用它来破坏摄像机的图像
<30-3,CASTLE>to knock out the video feed to the cameras.

865
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,860
<30-3,CASTLE>有人精心设计
<30-3,CASTLE>Boy, someone planned very carefully

866
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,560
<30-3,CASTLE>要在杰克·辛克莱来这拍摄的当晚杀掉他
<30-3,CASTLE>how to kill Jack Sinclair the night he was filming here.

867
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,880
<30-4,BECKETT>它使得电路超负荷
<30-4,BECKETT>It's taxing the power supply.

868
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,550
<30-4,BECKETT>那就解释了杰克死前灯为什么闪个不停
<30-4,BECKETT>That could explain the lights flickering just before Jack's death.

869
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,820
<30-5,CASTLE>磁场也解释了为什么
<30-5,CASTLE>You know, the magnetic field would also explain

870
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,110
<30-5,CASTLE>我们看见录像带中的三脚架在晃动
<30-5,CASTLE>that tripod moving that we saw in the video.

871
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,710
<30-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看看这些痕迹
<30-6,BECKETT>Castle, look at these marks.

872
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,530
<30-6,BECKETT>这里曾经有张床
<30-6,BECKETT>There was a bed here.

873
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,610
<30-6,BECKETT>杰克出现前
<30-6,BECKETT>Matt Benton could've been here

874
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,940
<30-6,BECKETT>马特·本顿也许在这住过一段时间
<30-6,BECKETT>for days before Jack even showed up.

875
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,410
<30-7,CASTLE>自从梅兰妮·本顿死后
<30-7,CASTLE>You know, this house has been largely unoccupied

876
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,830
<30-7,CASTLE>这房子基本上空置着
<30-7,CASTLE>since the Melanie Benton killing.

877
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,510
<30-7,CASTLE>也许他们找不到马特·本顿
<30-7,CASTLE>Maybe the reason they couldn't find Matt Benton

878
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,240
<30-7,CASTLE>是因为他从未离开过
<30-7,CASTLE>is because he never left.

879
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,210
<30-7,CASTLE>他可能一直都住在这里
<30-7,CASTLE>He could've been living here the whole time.

880
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,760
<30-8,CASTLE>或许他现在就在这
<30-8,CASTLE>And maybe he's here right now.

881
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,680
<30-9,BECKETT>去开门
<30-9,BECKETT>Open the door.

882
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,130
<30-10,CASTLE>我的上帝啊   我的心脏
<30-10,CASTLE>Oh, my god. My heart.

883
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,420
<30-10,CASTLE>吓死我了
<30-10,CASTLE>I was so scared.

884
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,770
<30-11,CASTLE>怎么了
<30-11,CASTLE>What?

885
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,960
<30-12,CASTLE>不是吧
<30-12,CASTLE>Really? Really?

886
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,220
<30-13,CASTLE>这件外套人家不要了
<30-13,CASTLE>I am throwing away this coat.

887
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,310
<30-14,BECKETT>看  他袖口上绣有字母
<30-14,BECKETT>Look, his cuffs are monogrammed.

888
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,380
<30-14,BECKETT>"M.B."
<30-14,BECKETT>"M.B."

889
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,090
<30-16,BECKETT>看来你的推断是正确的
<30-16,BECKETT>Looks like you were right, Castle.

890
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,190
<30-16,BECKETT>马特·本顿从没离开麦拉伦老宅
<30-16,BECKETT>Matt Benton never did leave the McClaren Mansion.

891
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,960
<31-1,LANIE>牙科档案证实
<31-1,LANIE>Dental records confirm it.

892
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,520
<31-1,LANIE>他就是马特·本顿
<31-1,LANIE>That's Matt Benton.

893
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,510
<31-2,CASTLE>技术组需要更好的软件
<31-2,CASTLE>Tech really needs better software.

894
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,420
<31-3,BECKETT>死因呢
<31-3,BECKETT>Cause of death?

895
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,270
<31-4,LANIE>现在还不能确定
<31-4,LANIE>Don't know yet,

896
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,050
<31-4,LANIE>但我认为肯定不是因为藏猫猫藏久了藏死的
<31-4,LANIE>but I'm guessing it wasn't the world's longest game of hide-and-seek.

897
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,290
<31-5,BECKETT>他死了多久了
<31-5,BECKETT>How long was he in there for?

898
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,930
<31-6,LANIE>还在等测试结果
<31-6,LANIE>Still waiting on the test results,

899
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,240
<31-6,LANIE>组织样本的初步报告显示
<31-6,LANIE>but the prelim reports on the tissue samples suggests

900
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,990
<31-6,LANIE>他死了将近二十年
<31-6,LANIE>he died about 20 years ago.

901
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,240
<31-7,BECKETT>那么有可能
<31-7,BECKETT>Okay, so then odds are

902
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,190
<31-7,BECKETT>他和他妻子在同一时间被杀
<31-7,BECKETT>he was killed at the same time his wife Melanie was.

903
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,310
<31-8,CASTLE>凶手藏匿马特的尸体
<31-8,CASTLE>So the killer hides Matt's body,

904
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,730
<31-8,CASTLE>让人误以为马特是凶手
<31-8,CASTLE>making it appear as though he fled,

905
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,280
<31-8,CASTLE>杀妻后畏罪潜逃
<31-8,CASTLE>framing Matt for his wife's murder,

906
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,700
<31-8,CASTLE>让所有人都放弃寻找真凶
<31-8,CASTLE>and throwing everyone off the trail of the real killer.

907
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,490
<31-9,LANIE>它奏效了   二十年来没人发现
<31-9,LANIE>And it worked, too, for 20 years.

908
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,390
<31-10,BECKETT>直到杰克·辛克莱出现
<31-10,BECKETT>Yeah, until Jack Sinclair showed up.

909
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,040
<31-11,BECKETT>-测试结果出来通知我  -好的
<31-11,BECKETT>- Let me know about the test results. - Okay.

910
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,360
<31-12,LANIE>四人晚餐吃的愉快吗
<31-12,LANIE>How'd that double date go?

911
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,520
<31-14,CASTLE>我只是
<31-14,CASTLE>I-I just...

912
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,030
<31-15,BECKETT>还有件事
<31-15,BECKETT>You guys... One thing.

913
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,640
<31-15,BECKETT>如果马特二十年前就被杀了
<31-15,BECKETT>If Matt was killed 20 years ago,

914
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,450
<31-15,BECKETT>那他十五年前是如何寄那些明信片给彼得的
<31-15,BECKETT>then how'd he send those postcards to Pete 15 years ago?

915
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,790
<31-16,CASTLE>我想是时候好好查查彼得·本顿了
<31-16,CASTLE>I think it's time we took a harder look at Pete Benton.

916
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,600
<31-17,CASTLE>别问约会的事
<31-17,CASTLE>Don't ask about the date.

917
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,100
<32-1,RYAN>我说了我很抱歉  好吗
<32-1,RYAN>Look, I said I'm sorry, okay?

918
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,630
<32-1,RYAN>我不是故意乌鸦嘴的
<32-1,RYAN>I didn't mean to jinx the dinner.

919
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,310
<32-2,ESPOSITO>真是完美的一晚
<32-2,ESPOSITO>"This really is the perfect night."

920
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,390
<32-3,RYAN>珍妮有点情不自禁
<32-3,RYAN>Jenny got a little caught up in the moment.

921
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,780
<32-3,RYAN>你俩什么时候结婚
<32-3,RYAN>"When are you two getting married"?

922
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,650
<32-4,ESPOSITO>那是决不能问的问题
<32-4,ESPOSITO>That's a question you do not ask.

923
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,860
<32-5,ESPOSITO>好吧  其实
<32-5,ESPOSITO>All right, you know, it's--

924
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,770
<32-5,ESPOSITO>不完全是你们的错
<32-5,ESPOSITO>it's not entirely you guys' fault.

925
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,910
<32-6,RYAN>你们俩后来大吵了一架吗
<32-6,RYAN>You guys have a big fight after?

926
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,430
<32-7,ESPOSITO>大吵  没有
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Big fight? No.

927
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,610
<32-7,ESPOSITO>比大吵更厉害
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Mega fight? Yes.

928
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,080
<32-8,ESPOSITO>重点是  我们
<32-8,ESPOSITO>The point is... we, um,

929
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,150
<32-8,ESPOSITO>我们决定分开冷静下
<32-8,ESPOSITO>we decided that we're gonna cool things off.

930
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,210
<32-9,RYAN>什么  你是说你们分手了
<32-9,RYAN>What, you mean split up?

931
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,810
<32-10,ESPOSITO>是的  直到我们弄清楚彼此想要什么
<32-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Just until we both figure out what we want.

932
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,490
<32-11,RYAN>哥们  我很抱歉
<32-11,RYAN>Man, I'm so sorry.

933
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,160
<32-12,ESPOSITO>不管怎样
<32-12,ESPOSITO>Anyway...

934
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,390
<32-13,RYAN>哥们  如果你需要我
<32-13,RYAN>Look, brother, if you need me for anything,

935
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,690
<32-13,RYAN>不管什么事我都挺你  怎么了
<32-13,RYAN>you know I'm always here to-- what?

936
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,380
<32-15,ESPOSITO>也许不是重要发现  但
<32-15,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe nothing, but...

937
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,140
<32-15,ESPOSITO>这个灯泡
<32-15,ESPOSITO>This lightbulb...

938
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,150
<32-15,ESPOSITO>是新的
<32-15,ESPOSITO>is brand-new.

939
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,970
<33-1,PETE>你们在跟我开玩笑吗
<33-1,PETE>Are you kidding me?

940
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,250
<33-1,PETE>探长  这算得上是骚扰了
<33-1,PETE>Detective, this is bordering on harassment.

941
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,050
<33-1,PETE>我已经告诉了你关于我弟弟的一切
<33-1,PETE>I told you everything I know about my brother.

942
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,760
<33-1,PETE>你隐瞒了一些
<33-1,PETE>Not everything.

943
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,060
<33-2,BECKETT>你曾经订过婚  不是吗  本顿先生
<33-2,BECKETT>You were engaged once, weren't you, Mr. Benton?

944
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,470
<33-3,CASTLE>同梅兰妮·温德尔
<33-3,CASTLE>To a Melanie Wendell.

945
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,630
<33-3,CASTLE>后来梅兰妮悔婚
<33-3,CASTLE>Until Melanie broke it off

946
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,710
<33-3,CASTLE>转而嫁给了你弟弟
<33-3,CASTLE>and married your brother instead.

947
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,390
<33-4,PETE>我们没能走到最后
<33-4,PETE>Things didn't work out for us.

948
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,260
<33-4,PETE>我没期望梅兰妮会一直单身
<33-4,PETE>I didn't expect Melanie to stay single forever.

949
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,590
<33-5,CASTLE>但是你再没结过婚
<33-5,CASTLE>But you never married,

950
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,610
<33-5,CASTLE>因为你从未忘记过她  对吗
<33-5,CASTLE>Because you never got over her, did you?

951
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,600
<33-6,BECKETT>彼得  寄那些明信片的到底是谁
<33-6,BECKETT>Who really sent those postcards, Pete?

952
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,650
<33-6,BECKETT>是你自己寄的吗
<33-6,BECKETT>Did you send 'em yourself?

953
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,530
<33-6,BECKETT>你们在胡说什么啊
<33-6,BECKETT>What the hell are you talking about?

954
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,110
<33-7,PETE>我弟弟寄给我的
<33-7,PETE>My brother sent me those postcards.

955
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,420
<33-8,BECKETT>你我都知道那是不可能的
<33-8,BECKETT>You and I both know that's not possible.

956
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,250
<33-8,BECKETT>你弟弟已经死了二十年了
<33-8,BECKETT>Your brother has been dead for 20 years.

957
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,100
<33-9,PETE>什么
<33-9,PETE>What?

958
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,960
<33-10,BECKETT>我们在麦拉伦老宅发现了他的尸体
<33-10,BECKETT>We found his remains in the McClaren house.

959
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,440
<33-10,BECKETT>事情败露了
<33-10,BECKETT>It's over.

960
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,210
<33-11,PETE>你以为是我杀了自己弟弟
<33-11,PETE>You think I killed my brother?

961
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,690
<33-11,PETE>你以为是我杀了梅兰妮
<33-11,PETE>You think I killed Melanie?

962
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,260
<33-12,BECKETT>那晚你在哪  彼得
<33-12,BECKETT>Where were you that night, Pete?

963
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,010
<33-13,PETE>我会明明白白地告诉你那晚我在哪
<33-13,PETE>I'll tell you exactly where I was.

964
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,660
<33-13,PETE>我和我朋友玛丽共进晚餐
<33-13,PETE>I went to dinner with my friend Marie--

965
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,660
<33-13,PETE>73街  如爱餐馆
<33-13,PETE>73, Cafe Jouer.

966
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,940
<33-13,PETE>我们九点离开的
<33-13,PETE>We were out by 9:00.

967
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,070
<33-13,PETE>后来我们去杜兰酒吧喝酒
<33-13,PETE>We stopped at Dorian's for a drink.

968
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,930
<33-13,PETE>我点了杯七七 [鸡尾酒]
<33-13,PETE>I had a 7 and 7.

969
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,040
<33-13,PETE>为我们服务的是帕特克
<33-13,PETE>Our server was Patrick.

970
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,650
<33-14,PETE>那样的事情发生时
<33-14,PETE>When something like that happens,

971
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,300
<33-14,PETE>它会深深地刻在你脑海里
<33-14,PETE>it's burned into your brain.

972
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,730
<33-14,PETE>那晚你听到的每个细节
<33-14,PETE>Every detail of what happened the night you heard.

973
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,810
<33-14,PETE>我怎么忘也忘不掉
<33-14,PETE>I couldn't forget it if I tried.

974
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,380
<33-15,BECKETT>彼得  我们会去证实你的说辞
<33-15,BECKETT>We're gonna have to verify your story, Pete.

975
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,010
<33-16,PETE>这么说  我
<33-16,PETE>So... My--

976
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,220
<33-16,PETE>梅兰妮不是我弟弟杀死的
<33-16,PETE>my brother didn't kill Melanie?

977
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,620
<33-17,CASTLE>我们不认为是他干的
<33-17,CASTLE>We don't think so.

978
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,560
<33-18,PETE>我一直以为是他做的
<33-18,PETE>I've always assumed that he did.

979
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
<33-18,PETE>马特脾气暴躁
<33-18,PETE>Matt had a terrible temper.

980
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,430
<33-18,PETE>他坚信梅兰妮出轨了
<33-18,PETE>He was convinced that Melanie was cheating on him.

981
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,510
<33-19,BECKETT>她有吗
<33-19,BECKETT>Was she?

982
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,720
<33-20,PETE>如果她有我也不会感到震惊
<33-20,PETE>Wouldn't surprise me if she was.

983
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,050
<33-20,PETE>马特怀疑是与她共事的人
<33-20,PETE>Matt thought it was somebody at work.

984
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,680
<34-1,RYAN>不是跟梅兰妮共事的人
<34-1,RYAN>It wasn't someone Melanie worked with.

985
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,520
<34-1,RYAN>我刚跟乔治·本纳谈过
<34-1,RYAN>I just tracked down George Banner,

986
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,440
<34-1,RYAN>二十年前梅兰妮在畅游旅行的上司
<34-1,RYAN>Melanie's manager at Fly-wide Travel from 20 years ago.

987
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,380
<34-1,RYAN>他说梅兰妮有两个同事
<34-1,RYAN>He said Melanie had two coworkers,

988
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,690
<34-1,RYAN>都是男的
<34-1,RYAN>both guys...

989
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,710
<34-3,RYAN>-已婚   -结婚也可以乱搞嘛
<34-3,RYAN>- Married... - Still?

990
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,180
<34-4,CASTLE>同性婚姻
<34-4,CASTLE>to each other.

991
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:30,330
<34-6,CASTLE>畅游以前在市中心的高层写字楼
<34-6,CASTLE>Well, Fly-wide was in a high-rise in midtown.

992
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,990
<34-7,BECKETT>也许出轨的对象是楼里的其他人
<34-7,BECKETT>So maybe it was someone else in the building.

993
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,730
<34-7,BECKETT>我们去查查当年梅兰妮在那工作时
<34-7,BECKETT>Let's get a list of all the tenants that were there

994
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,740
<34-7,BECKETT>还有哪些人租了写字楼
<34-7,BECKETT>when Melanie worked there.

995
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,090
<34-8,ESPOSITO>我想没这个必要了
<34-8,ESPOSITO>I'm not sure that's necessary.

996
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,880
<34-8,ESPOSITO>还记得我从那个密室里拿的灯泡吗
<34-8,ESPOSITO>Remember the lightbulb I took from that secret room?

997
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,470
<34-10,ESPOSITO>-当然  -我去查了灯泡的序列号
<34-10,ESPOSITO>- Yeah.  - Well, I traced the serial number.

998
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,760
<34-10,ESPOSITO>那个灯泡是厂商直销给福勒物业
<34-10,ESPOSITO>It belongs to a lot that was sold by the manufacturer

999
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,120
<34-10,ESPOSITO>一批灯泡中的一个
<34-10,ESPOSITO>directly to Fuller Estate Management.

1000
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,710
<34-11,BECKETT>-史蒂夫·福勒的公司吗  -正是麦拉伦老宅宅主
<34-11,BECKETT>- As in Steve Fuller?  - Owner of the McClaren mansion.

1001
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,010
<34-13,RYAN>那也就是说福勒知道那间密室的存在
<34-13,RYAN>That means that Fuller knew about that room

1002
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,310
<34-13,RYAN>却没告诉我们
<34-13,RYAN>and didn't tell us.

1003
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,040
<34-14,CASTLE>而他故意隐瞒只有一个理由
<34-14,CASTLE>There's only reason why he wouldn't tell us...

1004
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,090
<34-14,CASTLE>那就是他才是真正的凶手
<34-14,CASTLE>because he's the killer.

1005
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,960
<34-15,CASTLE>也许马特·本顿猜得没错
<34-15,CASTLE>Maybe Matt Benton was right about

1006
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,670
<34-15,CASTLE>梅兰妮的确有外遇
<34-15,CASTLE>Melanie having an affair,

1007
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,100
<34-15,CASTLE>但是他却猜错了她的外遇对象
<34-15,CASTLE>only wrong about who she was having the affair with.

1008
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,140
<34-17,ESPOSITO>-但是  -当事情败露后  他就杀了她
<34-17,ESPOSITO>- But --  - And when things went bad, he killed her,

1009
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,430
<34-17,ESPOSITO>还有马特  然后把尸体藏在自己的房子里
<34-17,ESPOSITO>killed Matt, and stashed his body in his own house

1010
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,430
<34-17,ESPOSITO>他知道没人找得到
<34-17,ESPOSITO>where he knew no one would find it.

1011
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,530
<34-18,CASTLE>而且他还计划要毁尸灭迹
<34-18,CASTLE>And he planned on destroying the evidence.

1012
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,960
<34-18,CASTLE>他在那几起谋杀案过后
<34-18,CASTLE>He wanted to have the house torn down

1013
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,900
<34-18,CASTLE>还想拆掉房子
<34-18,CASTLE>right after those murders,

1014
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:10,850
<34-18,CASTLE>-但房子却被列为地标  -慢
<34-18,CASTLE>- but it was declared a landmark.  - Y --

1015
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,550
<34-19,RYAN>于是他就利用密道来吓走租客
<34-19,RYAN>So he used that passageway to scare off

1016
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,960
<34-19,RYAN>比如博伊尔一家  让鬼宅越传越邪
<34-19,RYAN>tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion's legend

1017
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,030
<34-19,RYAN>以至于没人再敢住进去了
<34-19,RYAN>so that no one would want to live there.

1018
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,720
<34-20,CASTLE>然后杰克·辛克莱又跑来四处打探
<34-20,CASTLE>And then when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around,

1019
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,960
<34-20,CASTLE>他不得再开杀戒
<34-20,CASTLE>he had to kill him, too.

1020
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,980
<34-21,BECKETT>说完了吧
<34-21,BECKETT>You guys.

1021
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,210
<34-22,BECKETT>故事很精彩  但是检察官才不会买账呢
<34-22,BECKETT>Great story. The D.A. will never buy it.

1022
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,570
<34-22,BECKETT>这不能直接证明他有罪
<34-22,BECKETT>It's all circumstantial.

1023
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,550
<34-22,BECKETT>她说得没错
<34-22,BECKETT>She's right.

1024
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,310
<34-23,ESPOSITO>可能是任何人安装的灯泡
<34-23,ESPOSITO>Anyone could've put that bulb in there.

1025
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,630
<34-23,ESPOSITO>我们没有证据
<34-23,ESPOSITO>We have no proof.

1026
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,890
<34-24,CASTLE>证据会有的
<34-24,CASTLE>But we will.

1027
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,370
<34-24,CASTLE>我想我有办法让福勒先生
<34-24,CASTLE>And I think I know just how to get Mr. Fuller

1028
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,760
<34-24,CASTLE>把心中的鬼给招出来
<34-24,CASTLE>to give up the ghost.

1029
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,020
<35-1,CASTLE>-你觉得他会来吗  -不知道
<35-1,CASTLE>- Think he'll show?  - I don't know.

1030
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,450
<35-3,CASTLE>-你跟他说了明天的事了吧  -说了  卡塞尔
<35-3,CASTLE>- You told him about tomorrow, right?  - Yes, Castle.

1031
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,750
<35-4,BECKETT>他以为我们明天就要近密室一探究竟
<35-4,BECKETT>He thinks we're going through that wall in the morning.

1032
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,490
<35-4,BECKETT>所以如果福勒就是凶手的话
<35-4,BECKETT>So if Fuller's our guy,

1033
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,320
<35-4,BECKETT>他今晚就该来转移马特·本顿的尸体
<35-4,BECKETT>he should be coming for Matt Benton's body tonight.

1034
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,490
<35-4,BECKETT>前提是他是真凶  备不住根本就不是他干的
<35-4,BECKETT>If he's our guy. I mean, he might not be our guy.

1035
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,550
<35-5,CASTLE>说曹操曹操到
<35-5,CASTLE>And yet, there he is.

1036
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,790
<35-5,CASTLE>当然啦  他也有可能是来修马桶的
<35-5,CASTLE>Of course, he might just be here to fix a busted toilet.

1037
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
<36-1,CASTLE>需要帮忙吗  福勒
<36-1,CASTLE>Need a hand with that, Fuller?

1038
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,040
<36-2,BECKETT>史密斯警探
<36-2,BECKETT>Detective Smith?

1039
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,410
<36-3,SMITH>贝克特探长
<36-3,SMITH>Detective Beckett.

1040
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,770
<36-4,BECKETT>一直以来
<36-4,BECKETT>It was...you...

1041
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,560
<36-4,BECKETT>都是你  为什么
<36-4,BECKETT>all this time. Why?

1042
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,030
<36-5,SMITH>你知道吗  他一直对她施暴
<36-5,SMITH>You know, he was abusing her.

1043
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,200
<36-5,SMITH>下手残忍
<36-5,SMITH>Terrible things.

1044
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,130
<36-5,SMITH>我们没有一个月
<36-5,SMITH>I don't think a month went by,

1045
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,800
<36-5,SMITH>不接到来自这里的报警电话的
<36-5,SMITH>we didn't get called up to this house.

1046
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
<36-5,SMITH>我有一天下午过来  想看看她是否一切都好
<36-5,SMITH>And one day, I stopped by in the afternoon to check on her.

1047
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,530
<36-6,BECKETT>你是她的外遇对象
<36-6,BECKETT>You were the affair.

1048
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,030
<36-7,SMITH>那根本不是外遇
<36-7,SMITH>It wasn't an affair.

1049
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,960
<36-7,SMITH>而是爱
<36-7,SMITH>It was love.

1050
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,510
<36-8,CASTLE>那你为什么要杀她
<36-8,CASTLE>Then why'd you kill her?

1051
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,050
<36-9,SMITH>我没想要杀她  但是
<36-9,SMITH>I didn't mean to. It just...

1052
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,610
<36-9,SMITH>她想跟我分手
<36-9,SMITH>She wanted to call it off with me.

1053
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,090
<36-9,SMITH>我无法接受
<36-9,SMITH>And I couldn't let that happen.

1054
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,380
<36-10,CASTLE>那马特·本顿呢
<36-10,CASTLE>And Matt Benton?

1055
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,910
<36-11,SMITH>他那样对待她  纯属是死有余辜
<36-11,SMITH>The way he treated her, he deserved what he got.

1056
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,900
<36-12,BECKETT>作为案件的主要负责人
<36-12,BECKETT>And as the lead officer,

1057
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,140
<36-12,BECKETT>你知道你可以把调查方向引开
<36-12,BECKETT>you knew you could steer the investigation off yourself

1058
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,730
<36-12,BECKETT>引到一个他们永远都找不到的人身上
<36-12,BECKETT>and on to someone they'd never find.

1059
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,420
<36-13,CASTLE>然后你又寄来了那些明信片
<36-13,CASTLE>And then you sent those postcards

1060
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,920
<36-13,CASTLE>让人们以为你的疑犯还活着
<36-13,CASTLE>to keep your suspect alive.

1061
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,660
<36-14,SMITH>我让大家以为他才是凶手
<36-14,SMITH>I had 'em think that he did it.

1062
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,410
<36-14,SMITH>反正这一切本来也都是他的错
<36-14,SMITH>It was his fault anyway.

1063
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,770
<36-15,BECKETT>那杰克·辛克莱呢  你是怎么知道他来打探
<36-15,BECKETT>What about Jack Sinclair? How'd you find out about him?

1064
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,720
<36-16,SMITH>我答应过福勒  我总有一天要破了这个案子
<36-16,SMITH>I promised Fuller that I would solve this case one day.

1065
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,760
<36-16,SMITH>我让他无论有任何进展都通知我
<36-16,SMITH>I asked him to keep me informed of any developments.

1066
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,880
<36-17,BECKETT>所以当杰克联系福勒提及犯罪现场时
<36-17,BECKETT>So that when Jack contacted Fuller about the crime scene,

1067
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,920
<36-17,BECKETT>他给你打了电话
<36-17,BECKETT>he called you.

1068
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,460
<36-18,CASTLE>当我们告诉福勒  我们准备
<36-18,CASTLE>And when we told Fuller we were gonna

1069
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,000
<36-18,CASTLE>明天清查那个房间的时候
<36-18,CASTLE>check out that room tomorrow,

1070
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,020
<36-18,CASTLE>他也打了电话给你
<36-18,CASTLE>he called you then, too.

1071
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,980
<36-19,SMITH>你们俩都很聪明
<36-19,SMITH>You're both very smart.

1072
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,480
<36-19,SMITH>但是你们忘了一件事
<36-19,SMITH>But you're forgetting one thing.

1073
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,330
<36-19,SMITH>这个房子闹鬼
<36-19,SMITH>This house is haunted.

1074
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,410
<36-20,SMITH>谢谢你的枪  探长  真的很感谢
<36-20,SMITH>Thanks for the gun, detective. I really appreciate it.

1075
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,120
<36-20,SMITH>我对辛克莱表示遗憾  真的
<36-20,SMITH>You know, I felt bad about Sinclair. I really did.

1076
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,410
<36-20,SMITH>但那晚的事他知道的太多了
<36-20,SMITH>But he knew too much about that night,

1077
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,970
<36-20,SMITH>连报上没登的也知道
<36-20,SMITH>stuff that wasn't in the papers.

1078
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,280
<36-21,CASTLE>所以他不得不死
<36-21,CASTLE>So he had to go.

1079
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,740
<36-22,SMITH>跪下
<36-22,SMITH>Get on your knees.

1080
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,890
<36-23,BECKETT>别担心  卡塞尔  他不会开枪的
<36-23,BECKETT>Don't worry, Castle. He's not gonna shoot us.

1081
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,040
<36-23,BECKETT>那就与传说不符了
<36-23,BECKETT>That won't fit the legend.

1082
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,720
<36-24,CASTLE>你还有什么有用信息要跟凶手讲吗
<36-24,CASTLE>Any more helpful hints you'd care to pass along to our killer?

1083
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,190
<36-25,SMITH>跪下
<36-25,SMITH>On your knees.

1084
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,840
<36-26,BECKETT>我不要  艾迪森
<36-26,BECKETT>I don't think so, Addison.

1085
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,260
<36-27,CASTLE>你也知道  恶鬼只有在
<36-27,CASTLE>Y-you see, the demon

1086
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,060
<36-27,CASTLE>神不知鬼不觉的情况下才杀人
<36-27,CASTLE>only really kills when no one's looking.

1087
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,810
<36-27,CASTLE>但今晚  我们可是有观众
<36-27,CASTLE>And tonight, we have an audience.

1088
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,340
<36-28,BECKETT>你招供他们都记录下来了
<36-28,BECKETT>They recorded your full confession.

1089
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,800
<36-29,OFFICER>你有权利保持沉默
<36-29,OFFICER>You have a right to remain silent.

1090
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,920
<36-30,ESPOSITO>人赃并获呀
<36-30,ESPOSITO>So busted.

1091
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,380
<36-31,RYAN>鬼赃并获
<36-31,RYAN>Ghost busted,

1092
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,720
<36-32,RYAN>多亏了露露啊
<36-32,RYAN>thanks to Lulu.

1093
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,810
<36-33,LULU>为了他  这点小事不足挂齿
<36-33,LULU>It's the least I could do for him, you know?

1094
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,340
<36-33,LULU>我是说杰克
<36-33,LULU>For Jack.

1095
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:40,990
<37-1,CASTLE>这么说福勒根本不知道有密室
<37-1,CASTLE>So Fuller had no idea about that room?

1096
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,210
<37-2,BECKETT>就像我们说的那样  灯泡可能是任何人
<37-2,BECKETT>Well, like we said before, anyone could've grabbed

1097
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,000
<37-2,BECKETT>从宅子哪个房间取下来
<37-2,BECKETT>the lightbulb from another part of the house

1098
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,260
<37-2,BECKETT>然后安进去的  看来就是史密斯了
<37-2,BECKETT>and placed it there. I guess Smith did it.

1099
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,060
<37-2,BECKETT>他现在在检察官办公室写认罪书呢
<37-2,BECKETT>He's in with the D.A. right now writing his confession.

1100
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,200
<37-3,CASTLE>我不明白的是
<37-3,CASTLE>Yeah, well, what I don't get is,

1101
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,420
<37-3,CASTLE>如果他那么爱梅兰妮  为什么还要杀她呢
<37-3,CASTLE>if he was so in love with Melanie, why would he kill her?

1102
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,410
<37-4,BECKETT>他说他是被恶鬼逼他做的
<37-4,BECKETT>He said that a demon made him do it.

1103
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,980
<37-5,BECKETT>我敢说他只是为用精神失常辩护做铺垫罢了
<37-5,BECKETT>Just laying the groundwork for his insanity plea, I'm sure.

1104
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,990
<37-6,CASTLE>也许吧
<37-6,CASTLE>Perhaps.

1105
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,170
<37-7,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  就算是你也得承认
<37-7,BECKETT>Oh, come on, Castle, even you have to admit,

1106
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,580
<37-7,BECKETT>这一切  每个闹鬼的传说  每起凶案
<37-7,BECKETT>everything -- every haunting, every death,

1107
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
<37-7,BECKETT>每件跟麦拉伦老宅闹鬼
<37-7,BECKETT>everything even remotely connected

1108
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,480
<37-7,BECKETT>扯得上一丁点关系的事
<37-7,BECKETT>to paranormal activity in the McClaren house

1109
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,490
<37-7,BECKETT>都能被密道解释
<37-7,BECKETT>can be explained by that passageway.

1110
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,730
<37-7,BECKETT>这我可说不准
<37-7,BECKETT>I don't know.

1111
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,660
<37-8,CASTLE>那咱们昨天晚上在客厅的时候呢
<37-8,CASTLE>What about last night when we were in the living room?

1112
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,530
<37-8,CASTLE>门突然关上  灯和蜡烛熄灭的事呢
<37-8,CASTLE>How about the door, the light, the candle?

1113
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,880
<37-9,BECKETT>线路老旧  到处漏风
<37-9,BECKETT>Old wiring, drafty house.

1114
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
<37-10,CASTLE>也许不只是这样呢
<37-10,CASTLE>Or maybe it was something more.

1115
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,490
<37-10,CASTLE>你好好想想  要不是你想知道
<37-10,CASTLE>Think about it, if you hadn't gone looking for

1116
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,240
<37-10,CASTLE>吹灭蜡烛的风是从哪里吹进来的
<37-10,CASTLE>the draft that blew out the candle

1117
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,940
<37-10,CASTLE>你也就不会发现密道
<37-10,CASTLE>you would never have found the passageway

1118
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,610
<37-10,CASTLE>更不会发现马特·本顿的尸体
<37-10,CASTLE>or Matt Benton's body.

1119
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,020
<37-11,BECKETT>就跟我这个不信鬼神的人直说吧
<37-11,BECKETT>Spell it out for those of us that are paranormally impaired.

1120
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,210
<37-12,CASTLE>也许是有人想让我们发现密道
<37-12,CASTLE>Maybe someone wanted us to find that passageway.

1121
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,900
<37-12,CASTLE>也许
<37-12,CASTLE>Maybe...

1122
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,170
<37-12,CASTLE>杰克·辛克莱的鬼魂
<37-12,CASTLE>Jack Sinclair's ghost

1123
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,020
<37-12,CASTLE>在帮我们侦破他自己的凶杀案
<37-12,CASTLE>was helping solve his own murder.

1124
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,140
<37-13,BECKETT>好吧  这样好了
<37-13,BECKETT>Okay, I'll tell you what.

1125
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,470
<37-13,BECKETT>只要你承认世界上没有恶鬼
<37-13,BECKETT>I will admit to that possibility

1126
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,650
<37-13,BECKETT>-我就承认这种可能性  -成交
<37-13,BECKETT>- if you admit there is no demon.  - Done.

1127
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,740
<37-15,CASTLE>有人看到
<37-15,CASTLE>Did anyone see...

1128
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,380
<37-15,CASTLE>这还真是诡异
<37-15,CASTLE>That was weird.

1129
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,560
<38-1,ALEXIS>老爸
<38-1,ALEXIS>Hi, dad.

1130
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,840
<38-2,CASTLE>你还没睡呢
<38-2,CASTLE>Hey, you're up late.

1131
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,380
<38-2,CASTLE>还跟阿什利视频捉迷藏呢
<38-2,CASTLE>Playing skype-tag with Ashley?

1132
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,510
<38-3,ALEXIS>没  我们终于聊上了
<38-3,ALEXIS>No. We finally connected.

1133
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,320
<38-4,CASTLE>是正如你所期待的那样
<38-4,CASTLE>Ah. Was it everything you hoped for

1134
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,580
<38-4,CASTLE>而且更精彩吗
<38-4,CASTLE>in a peer-to-peer video conference and more?

1135
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,650
<38-5,ALEXIS>说实话
<38-5,ALEXIS>Honestly, it was...

1136
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,040
<38-5,ALEXIS>还真不怎么样
<38-5,ALEXIS>blah.

1137
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,610
<38-5,ALEXIS>他心不在焉  我也累得半死
<38-5,ALEXIS>I mean, he was preoccupied, and I was tired.

1138
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,130
<38-5,ALEXIS>而且我们俩又有时差  烦死了
<38-5,ALEXIS>And this whole time-difference thing is a real drag.

1139
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,650
<38-6,CASTLE>异地恋不容易是人尽皆知的事实
<38-6,CASTLE>Nobody said that long distance was easy.

1140
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,900
<38-7,ALEXIS>是啊  但我也没想到会这么不容易呀
<38-7,ALEXIS>Yeah, but is it supposed to be this hard?

1141
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,570
<38-8,CASTLE>这么说吧
<38-8,CASTLE>Well, I can tell you this...

1142
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,740
<38-8,CASTLE>任何一段
<38-8,CASTLE>Any relationship

1143
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,760
<38-8,CASTLE>十分钟以上的恋情
<38-8,CASTLE>that lasts longer than a breath mint

1144
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,360
<38-8,CASTLE>都会面临各式各样的挑战
<38-8,CASTLE>is going to have challenges.

1145
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,500
<38-8,CASTLE>但是如果一段恋情最终结束了
<38-8,CASTLE>But if a relationship doesn't work out,

1146
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,260
<38-8,CASTLE>通常都不是因为遇到了挑战
<38-8,CASTLE>it's usually not because of the challenges.

1147
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,030
<38-8,CASTLE>而是因为
<38-8,CASTLE>It's usually because

1148
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,420
<38-8,CASTLE>这段恋情一开始就不够牢固
<38-8,CASTLE>the relationship wasn't strong enough to begin with.

1149
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,050
<38-9,CASTLE>好受点了吗
<38-9,CASTLE>Does this help?

1150
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,600
<38-10,ALEXIS>-没  -我想也是
<38-10,ALEXIS>- Not really.  - Yeah.

1151
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,300
<38-12,ALEXIS>但是你的肩膀总会给我安慰
<38-12,ALEXIS>But this always does.

1152
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,510
<38-13,CASTLE>我可以向你保证
<38-13,CASTLE>I can promise you this...

1153
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,090
<38-15,CASTLE>只要两个人有共同的信仰  坚定的信仰
<38-15,CASTLE>if two people believe in something, really believe,

1154
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,930
<38-15,CASTLE>那么任何事  哪怕是最不可能的事
<38-15,CASTLE>anything, even the impossible,

1155
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,510
<38-15,CASTLE>都会变成可能
<38-15,CASTLE>is possible.

1156
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,860
<38-16,ALEXIS>就连
<38-16,ALEXIS>Even...

1157
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,230
<38-16,ALEXIS>食人僵尸也可能吗
<38-16,ALEXIS>flesh-eating zombies?

1158
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,080
<38-17,CASTLE>尤其是食人僵尸
<38-17,CASTLE>Oh, especially flesh-eating zombies.

1159
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,820
<38-18,CASTLE>咱们上次看到哪了
<38-18,CASTLE>Now where were we?

1160
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,800
<38-19,ALEXIS>就在这
<38-19,ALEXIS>Yeah, right there.
