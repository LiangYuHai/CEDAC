<2-5,CASTLE>这与阿什利没关系吧
<2-5,CASTLE>This wouldn't have anything to do with Ashley, would it?

17

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,400
<2-9,CASTLE>起不了任何作用
<2-9,CASTLE>sitting around reading "Pride And Prejudice."

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,710
<2-9,CASTLE>只会让事情更糟
<2-9,CASTLE>That's just gonna make it worse.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,170
<2-9,CASTLE>跟听阿黛勒的歌没什么区别
<2-9,CASTLE>You might as well be listening to Adele.

27

<2-13,CASTLE>A distraction.

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,080
<2-13,CASTLE>而碰巧

38
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,910
<2-14,ALEXIS>不会让我好起来的
<2-14,ALEXIS>make me feel better.

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,520
<3-30,RYAN>我去查查监控摄像头的事
<3-30,RYAN>Um, I-I'm gonna go check on those cameras.

118
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,250
<3-30,RYAN>他妈...
<3-30,RYAN>What the...

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,720
<3-31,ESPOSITO>瞧见了没
<3-31,ESPOSITO>Did you see that?

120
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,930
<3-31,ESPOSITO>他回避我
<3-31,ESPOSITO>He just sidestepped me.

121
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,030
<3-31,ESPOSITO>怎么回事
<3-31,ESPOSITO>What's that about?

122
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,470
<3-32,CASTLE>好像一想到婚期将至
<3-32,CASTLE>It's almost as though the thought of marriage

123
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,890
<3-32,CASTLE>就让他感觉末日来临
<3-32,CASTLE>fills him with an impending sense of doom.

124
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,690
<3-32,CASTLE>不  那是我
<3-32,CASTLE>Oh, no, wait. That's me.

125
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,890
<4-1,CASTLE>有导航系统
<4-1,CASTLE>Nav system?

126
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,140
<4-2,BECKETT>对  看来西格尔来这前
<4-2,BECKETT>Yeah, and it looks like Siegel made a stop

127
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,780
<4-2,BECKETT>还去过另一处
<4-2,BECKETT>just before he got here.

128
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,380
<4-3,BECKETT>西区大街537号
<4-3,BECKETT>537 West End Avenue.

129
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,950
<4-4,CASTLE>看来萨姆在曼哈顿有旧交
<4-4,CASTLE>Looks like Sam's got a friend here in Manhattan.

130
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,540
<5-1,ESPOSITO>萨姆·西格尔  46岁
<5-1,ESPOSITO>Sam Siegel, 46 years old,

131
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,090
<5-1,ESPOSITO>是靠房地产发家的
<5-1,ESPOSITO>got his start in real estate development,

132
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,140
<5-1,ESPOSITO>然后在1999年创立
<5-1,ESPOSITO>and then he went on to launch

133
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,710
<5-1,ESPOSITO>宝石蓝海滨度假胜地和赌场
<5-1,ESPOSITO>The Sapphire Coast Resort and Casino in 1999.

134
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,980
<5-2,CASTLE>要做一个赌场主必会与人树敌
<5-2,CASTLE>You don't come to be a casino owner without making enemies.

135
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,470
<5-2,CASTLE>《教父》里的莫·格林不就如此
<5-2,CASTLE>Look at Moe Greene in "The godfather."

136
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,250
<5-3,ESPOSITO>这家伙似乎是个杰出市民
<5-3,ESPOSITO>And this guy seems to be a stand-up citizen.

137
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,840
<5-3,ESPOSITO>他有个基金会  专门捐钱给
<5-3,ESPOSITO>He has a foundation that gives money to

138
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,820
<5-3,ESPOSITO>慈善机构和公立学校
<5-3,ESPOSITO>charities and public schools.

139
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,720
<5-4,BECKETT>好  去查一下赌场员工
<5-4,BECKETT>All right, check with the staff at the casino.

140
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,380
<5-4,BECKETT>看看他是否在曼哈顿约了人
<5-4,BECKETT>See if he had any meetings here in Manhattan

141
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,560
<5-4,BECKETT>查清他离开大西洋城的时间
<5-4,BECKETT>and find out what time he left Atlantic City.

142
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,450
<5-5,ESPOSITO>好
<5-5,ESPOSITO>All right.

143
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,950
<5-6,CASTLE>如果有人约我
<5-6,CASTLE>You know, if someone asked to meet me

144
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,730
<5-6,CASTLE>夜深人静时去废弃仓库见面
<5-6,CASTLE>at an abandoned warehouse in the dead of night,

145
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,970
<5-6,CASTLE>我肯定不去
<5-6,CASTLE>I'd pass.

146
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,900
<5-6,CASTLE>这种场景我写过很多次了  绝没有好下场
<5-6,CASTLE>I've written that scene enough times to know how it ends.

147
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,280
<5-7,RYAN>西格尔的导航仪上的那个地址
<5-7,RYAN>Hey, that address that was on Siegel's GPS?

148
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,080
<5-7,RYAN>是他前妻瑞贝卡的居住的大厦
<5-7,RYAN>Turns out it's a building where his ex-wife Rebecca lives.

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
<5-8,BECKETT>他们离婚多久了
<5-8,BECKETT>How long have they been divorced?

150
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,140
<5-9,RYAN>约六个月
<5-9,RYAN>About six months.

151
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,830
<5-10,CASTLE>时间不久  可能心里还有不快
<5-10,CASTLE>Recent enough for there to still be hard feelings.

152
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,980
<5-11,RYAN>根据邻居所述  那是相当不快
<5-11,RYAN>Mm. Well, according to the neighbors, very hard feelings.

153
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,240
<5-11,RYAN>昨晚有人报警投诉他们争吵声音太响
<5-11,RYAN>There was a report of a loud argument last night,

154
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
<5-11,RYAN>而且邻居说他们看见西格尔离开她家
<5-11,RYAN>and neighbors said they saw Siegel leaving her place

155
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
<5-11,RYAN>时间在八点半出头
<5-11,RYAN>just after 8:30.

156
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,770
<5-12,BECKETT>刚好就在他遇害前
<5-12,BECKETT>That's just before he was killed.

157
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,910
<6-1,REBECCA SIEGAL>对  我们是吵架了  但我没杀他
<6-1,REBECCA SIEGAL>Yeah, we argued, but I didn't kill him.

158
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,650
<6-2,CASTLE>你们离婚后他经常来看你吗
<6-2,CASTLE>Was it normal for him to come and see you after the divorce?

159
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,370
<6-2,CASTLE>不是
<6-2,CASTLE>No.

160
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,630
<6-3,REBECCA>实际上我有几个月没见他了
<6-3,REBECCA>In fact, I hadn't seen him in months.

161
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,760
<6-3,REBECCA>我们现在关系不太好
<6-3,REBECCA>We don't really get along anymore.

162
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,310
<6-4,BECKETT>你们当时为什么起争执
<6-4,BECKETT>What were the two of you fighting about?

163
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,150
<6-5,BECKETT>西格尔太太
<6-5,BECKETT>Ms. Siegel?

164
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,250
<6-6,REBECCA>他说他惹麻烦了
<6-6,REBECCA>He said he was in trouble.

165
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,430
<6-7,BECKETT>什么样的麻烦
<6-7,BECKETT>What kind of trouble?

166
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,090
<6-7,BECKETT>他不肯说
<6-7,BECKETT>He wouldn't say,

167
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,780
<6-8,REBECCA>可他想让我签字转让一处投资性房产
<6-8,REBECCA>but he wanted me to sign over an investment property

168
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,600
<6-8,REBECCA>目前仍在我们两个人名下
<6-8,REBECCA>that was still in both of our names--

169
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,220
<6-8,REBECCA>是皇后区的一栋楼
<6-8,REBECCA>a building here in queens,

170
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,290
<6-8,REBECCA>只是一家店面和几间公寓
<6-8,REBECCA>just a store and some apartments.

171
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,030
<6-8,REBECCA>我不知道原因  可...
<6-8,REBECCA>I don't know why, but...

172
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,180
<6-8,REBECCA>他非常着急要我签字
<6-8,REBECCA>he was very worked up about it.

173
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,020
<6-8,REBECCA>他出价一百五十万买我那份
<6-8,REBECCA>He offered me $1.5 million for my share,

174
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,140
<6-8,REBECCA>都够买下整栋楼了
<6-8,REBECCA>which is as much as the whole place was worth.

175
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,070
<6-8,REBECCA>他说他要保命就指望它了
<6-8,REBECCA>He said his life depended on it.

176
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,430
<6-9,CASTLE>那么这栋楼...
<6-9,CASTLE>So this building...

177
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,850
<6-9,CASTLE>他出了全价一百五十万而不是半价
<6-9,CASTLE>He offered you full price of $1.5 million instead of half,

178
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,650
<6-9,CASTLE>而你依然拒绝了
<6-9,CASTLE>and you still said no?

179
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,000
<6-10,REBECCA>我当时不知内情  还以为他有什么阴谋
<6-10,REBECCA>I didn't know. I thought he was working an angle.

180
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,220
<6-10,REBECCA>我告诉他  没有律师在场  我是不会签的
<6-10,REBECCA>I told him I couldn't sign anything without my lawyer.

181
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,780
<6-11,BECKETT>然后萨姆昨晚离开你家后
<6-11,BECKETT>And after Sam left your place last night,

182
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,570
<6-11,BECKETT>你干什么了
<6-11,BECKETT>what'd you did?

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,040
<6-12,REBECCA>我后来整晚都待在家里
<6-12,REBECCA>I was in my apartment for the rest of the evening.

184
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,330
<7-1,BECKETT>门卫也证实了她的口供
<7-1,BECKETT>So the doorman confirms the ex-wife's story.

185
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,120
<7-1,BECKETT>她整晚都待在公寓里
<7-1,BECKETT>She was in her apartment all night.

186
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
<7-2,GATES>贝克特探长
<7-2,GATES>Detective Beckett,

187
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
<7-2,GATES>我刚接到大西洋城市长的电话
<7-2,GATES>I just received a call from the mayor of Atlantic City.

188
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,850
<7-2,GATES>西格尔先生的死登上了头版新闻
<7-2,GATES>Mr. Siegel's death is front-page news.

189
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,110
<7-2,GATES>他们在打听嫌犯的消息
<7-2,GATES>They're asking about suspects.

190
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,200
<7-3,BECKETT>是  长官  我们也在查
<7-3,BECKETT>Yes, sir. So are we.

191
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,000
<7-4,GATES>他让前妻签字转让给他的房产查得怎么样了
<7-4,GATES>Well, how about the property he asked his ex to sign over to him?

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,070
<7-4,GATES>有进展吗
<7-4,GATES>Anything on that?

193
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,910
<7-5,BECKETT>只查到死者是一年半前购买的
<7-5,BECKETT>Um, just that the victim purchased it a year and a half ago

194
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,980
<7-5,BECKETT>全额现金付款
<7-5,BECKETT>and paid cash for the full amount.

195
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,920
<7-6,CASTLE>对  房产经纪人还觉得挺吃惊呢
<7-6,CASTLE>Yeah, the real estate agent was surprised anyone bought it.

196
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,640
<7-6,CASTLE>这栋房产已经挂牌销售有段时间了
<7-6,CASTLE>It had been on the market for... quite a while.

197
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,370
<7-7,RYAN>我刚和萨姆·西格尔的办公室通过电话
<7-7,RYAN>Just got off the phone with Sam Siegel's office.

198
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,310
<7-7,RYAN>看来他昨晚不是一个人离开大西洋城
<7-7,RYAN>Apparently, he didn't leave Atlantic City alone last night.

199
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,140
<7-8,ESPOSITO>没有迹象表明他的车上有乘客
<7-8,ESPOSITO>There was no indication of a passenger in his car.

200
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,210
<7-8,ESPOSITO>不是个乘客
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Not a passenger.

201
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,550
<7-8,ESPOSITO>是个司机
<7-8,ESPOSITO>A driver.

202
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,710
<7-9,RYAN>六点半左右  萨姆一位常用司机拉夫·马里诺
<7-9,RYAN>Around 6:30, one of Sam's regular drivers, Ralph Marino,

203
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,860
<7-9,RYAN>去赌场门口接他
<7-9,RYAN>picked him up in front of the casino

204
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,790
<7-9,RYAN>然后驾车送他去纽约城
<7-9,RYAN>and drove him to New York city.

205
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,020
<7-10,BECKETT>他现在在哪里
<7-10,BECKETT>And where is he now?

206
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,660
<7-11,RYAN>没人知道  他今天没来上班
<7-11,RYAN>No one knows. He didn't show up for work today.

207
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,600
<7-12,CASTLE>他要么被人灭口扔到河里
<7-12,CASTLE>Which means he's either floating in the Hudson...

208
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,910
<7-13,BECKETT>要么他也有瓜葛
<7-13,BECKETT>or he's involved.

209
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,550
<7-14,GATES>对马里诺先生有什么了解
<7-14,GATES>Well, what do we know about Mr. Marino?

210
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,090
<7-15,RYAN>不是什么好人  那是肯定的
<7-15,RYAN>Well, he's no boy scout, that's for sure.

211
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,820
<7-15,RYAN>背景调查发现他曾被控恶性诈骗
<7-15,RYAN>Background check shows felony racketeering

212
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,290
<7-15,RYAN>和人身侵犯
<7-15,RYAN>and assault charges.

213
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,920
<7-16,GATES>对拉夫·马里诺进行全面通缉
<7-16,GATES>Put out an all points on Ralph Marino.

214
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,280
<7-16,GATES>我让大西洋城的同事也去下通缉令
<7-16,GATES>I'll have our brethren in Atlantic City do the same.

215
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,210
<7-16,GATES>你们几个去大西洋城西格尔的赌场
<7-16,GATES>You boys head down to Atlantic City to Siegel's casino.

216
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,140
<7-16,GATES>去找马里诺的朋友和同事问话
<7-16,GATES>Talk to Marino's friends and coworkers

217
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,180
<7-16,GATES>看他们能不能提供他的下落
<7-16,GATES>and see if any of them can shine some light on his whereabouts.

218
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,150
<7-16,GATES>与此同时  贝克特
<7-16,GATES>Meanwhile, Beckett,

219
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,050
<7-16,GATES>你在这里指挥  让巡警去搜寻马里诺
<7-16,GATES>you run point from here, get unis canvassing for Marino,

220
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,540
<7-16,GATES>查明西格尔为何如此迫切要得到
<7-16,GATES>and figure out why in the hell Siegel was so desperate

<7-17,BECKETT>Yes, sir. Come on, Castle.

223
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,940
<7-18,CASTLE>盖茨警监说
<7-18,CASTLE>Oh, uh, Captain Gates said

224
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,580
<7-18,CASTLE>我们几个去大西洋城

<7-20,GATES>实际上  是我说了算
<7-20,GATES>Actually, that's my call.

<8-1,ESPOSITO>你在干什么
<8-1,ESPOSITO>What are you doing?

231
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,530
<8-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得呢
<8-1,ESPOSITO>What does it look like?

232
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,070
<8-2,CASTLE>你们以为我会错过
<8-2,CASTLE>Did you think I was gonna pass up

234
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,960
<8-2,CASTLE>去大西洋帝国公路之旅吗
<8-2,CASTLE>a road trip to the Boardwalk Empire,

235
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,010
<8-2,CASTLE>去东海岸的舞蹈  赌博  舞女的罪恶之都
<8-2,CASTLE>the east coast epicenter of dancing, gambling, showgirls, and sin?

236
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,660
<8-3,RYAN>你知道我们是去那儿调查凶案的吧
<8-3,RYAN>You do realize, we're going there to investigate a murder,

237
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,470
<8-3,RYAN>对吧
<8-3,RYAN>don't you?

238
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,780
<8-4,CASTLE>先生们  如果人生教了我什么道理
<8-4,CASTLE>Gentlemen, if I have learned one thing,

239
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,170
<8-4,CASTLE>那就是不要让凶案这种小事
<8-4,CASTLE>it's to not let a little thing like murder

240
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,960
<8-4,CASTLE>坏了我们玩乐的兴致
<8-4,CASTLE>get in the way of having a good time.

241
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,400
<8-5,CASTLE>对了  我要副驾位子
<8-5,CASTLE>And also, shotgun.

251
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,360
<9-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  我希望你没接电话
<9-1,CASTLE>Hey, Alexis. I hope you're not answering

252
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,240
<9-1,CASTLE>是因为你正忙着筹划你的女孩之夜
<9-1,CASTLE>because you are busy planning your girls' night.

253
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,840
<9-1,CASTLE>不管怎样  我要出城调查一桩案子
<9-1,CASTLE>Anyway, I'm going out of town on a case,

254
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,490
<9-1,CASTLE>今晚可能不回来了
<9-1,CASTLE>and we may just be spending the night.

255
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,970
<9-1,CASTLE>对  所以我会打电话抽查
<9-1,CASTLE>Yeah. So I'll call and I'll check on you.

256
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,790
<9-1,CASTLE>爱你  再见
<9-1,CASTLE>Love you. Bye.

257
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,080
<9-2,RYAN>别逗了  卡塞尔  我们今晚不过夜
<9-2,RYAN>Come on, Castle. We are not spending the night.

258
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,270
<9-3,CASTLE>你怎能这么说
<9-3,CASTLE>How can you say that?

259
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,040
<9-3,CASTLE>或许拉夫·马里诺很难找
<9-3,CASTLE>And maybe Ralph Marino will be very difficult to find,

260
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,170
<9-3,CASTLE>而且我觉得我们该从赌桌上开始找
<9-3,CASTLE>and I think we should start looking at the craps tables.

261
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,680
<9-5,RYAN>-没错  -我有点理解为什么你要丢下贝克特了
<9-5,RYAN>- Yeah. - Oh, I'm starting to understand why you ditched Beckett.

262
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,490
<9-5,RYAN>我要声明  这辆车里唯一一个
<9-5,RYAN>A-and for the record, the one guy in this car

263
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,010
<9-5,RYAN>不是真正的警察  不许抢副驾位
<9-5,RYAN>who's not a real cop is not allowed to call shotgun.

264
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,030
<9-6,CASTLE>公平竞争  先叫先得
<9-6,CASTLE>Called it fair and square.

265
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,210
<9-6,CASTLE>也许卡塞尔说得对
<9-6,CASTLE>Maybe Castle's right.

266
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,370
<9-7,ESPOSITO>反正我们也要去
<9-7,ESPOSITO>I mean, if--since we're gonna be there,

267
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,780
<9-7,ESPOSITO>何不考察一下宝石蓝适不适合
<9-7,ESPOSITO>we might as well consider the Sapphire

268
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,850
<9-7,ESPOSITO>举办单身派对呢
<9-7,ESPOSITO>as a potential bachelor party venue.

269
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,550
<9-8,CASTLE>我很高兴你这么说
<9-8,CASTLE>I'm so happy you said that,

270
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,220
<9-8,CASTLE>因为那里有好几个地方
<9-8,CASTLE>because there are a number of establishments down there

271
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,620
<9-8,CASTLE>可以举办单身派对
<9-8,CASTLE>that cater to bachelor party events.

272
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,050
<9-8,CASTLE>我想我们应该体验一下
<9-8,CASTLE>I think maybe we should take a little sampling.

273
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,190
<9-8,CASTLE>不  不  不
<9-8,CASTLE>No, no, no.

274
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
<9-9,RYAN>我们不去体验这些俱乐部
<9-9,RYAN>We are not sampling any clubs.

275
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,710
<9-9,RYAN>什么
<9-9,RYAN>What?

276
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,780
<9-10,ESPOSITO>别这样  老兄  你干嘛要给我们泼冷水呢
<9-10,ESPOSITO>Come on, bro. Why are you stalling us on this?

277
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,610
<9-11,RYAN>哈维尔  我
<9-11,RYAN>Look, Javier, I-I...

278
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,770
<9-11,RYAN>我有个坏消息
<9-11,RYAN>I got some bad news.

279
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,560
<9-12,RYAN>我必须得请珍妮同父异母的弟弟尼尔森
<9-12,RYAN>I had to ask Jenny's half-brother Nelson

280
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,830
<9-12,RYAN>做我的伴郎
<9-12,RYAN>to be my best man.

281

<9-13,ESPOSITO>才16岁  带牙套
<9-13,ESPOSITO>16, with braces,

284
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,580
<9-13,ESPOSITO>喋喋不休说要参加数学竞赛的那个家伙
<9-13,ESPOSITO>couldn't stop talking about being a mathlete.

285
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,650
<9-14,RYAN>得照顾家里情绪  我别无选择
<9-14,RYAN>It was a family thing. I-I didn't have a choice.

286
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,590
<9-15,ESPOSITO>你当然可以选
<9-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you did.

287
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,030
<9-16,CASTLE>不  其实在婚礼的问题上
<9-16,CASTLE>No, actually, when it comes to weddings,

288
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,060
<9-16,CASTLE>你确实没得选  相信我
<9-16,CASTLE>uh, you don't. Trust me.

289
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,930
<9-16,CASTLE>你可不想一结婚就让亲家结仇
<9-16,CASTLE>You do not want to start a marriage with a family feud.

290
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,520
<9-17,ESPOSITO>-糟透了  -我知道
<9-17,ESPOSITO>- This sucks. - I know.

291
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,920
<9-17,ESPOSITO>兄弟  我本想给你来个潇洒的送别
<9-17,ESPOSITO>And I was gonna give you an awesome send-off, bro.

292
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,080
<9-18,RYAN>我知道
<9-18,RYAN>I know.

293
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,940
<9-21,CASTLE>兄弟们  抱歉
<9-21,CASTLE>Well, boys, I'm sorry.

<9-21,CASTLE>很抱歉事情到了这般田地
<9-21,CASTLE>I'm sorry it had to come to this.

295
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,440
<9-21,CASTLE>我也不想的  但我们似乎别无选择
<9-21,CASTLE>I didn't want it to, but it looks like we have no choice.

296
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,090
<9-21,CASTLE>别无他法了
<9-21,CASTLE>There is no other way.

297
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,750
<9-21,CASTLE>只好明修栈道  暗度陈仓
<9-21,CASTLE>I.B.P.W.O.C.

298
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,150
<9-22,CASTLE>利用查案之机来一个即兴的单身派对了
<9-22,CASTLE>Impromptu bachelor party while on case.

299

<10-1,CASTLE>嗅到了吗
<10-1,CASTLE>Ah, you smell that?

300
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,210
<10-1,CASTLE>那是希望
<10-1,CASTLE>That is the smell of hopes,

301
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,450
<10-1,CASTLE>梦想和无尽机遇的气息
<10-1,CASTLE>dreams, and endless opportunities.

302
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,970
<10-2,RYAN>别跟烟味
<10-2,RYAN>Not to be confused with cigarette smoke,

303
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,460
<10-2,RYAN>酒味和绝望的气息混淆了
<10-2,RYAN>day drinking, and desperation.

304
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,790
<10-3,CASTLE>这就是赌场的绝妙之处
<10-3,CASTLE>Well, that's the great thing about casinos--

305
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,480

336
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,240
<11-4,BECKETT>所以看起来似乎没有不妥
<11-4,BECKETT>so there doesn't seem to be anything unusual about it.

337
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,420
<11-5,GATES>继续查
<11-5,GATES>Keep digging.

338
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,350
<11-6,BECKETT>探长
<11-6,BECKETT>Uh, look, Detective,

339
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,730
<11-7,GATES>我知道你认为我把你留下来
<11-7,GATES>I know you're probably thinking that I have you here

340
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,140
<11-7,GATES>可能是种变相惩罚
<11-7,GATES>as some kind of punishment.

341
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,310
<11-7,GATES>你是个好警察  但我觉得你去掉些干扰
<11-7,GATES>You're a good cop, but I think you can be better

342
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,900
<11-7,GATES>还能做得更好
<11-7,GATES>if you minimize the distractions.

343
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,910
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>痛失萨姆  真是让人伤心欲绝
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>Hell of a thing, losing Sam.

344
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,440
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>我们是联手创办了这家赌场
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>You know, he and I started out in this business together?

345
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,350
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>我们一砖一瓦把这里盖起来
<12-1,CHARLIE TURNER>We built this place from the ground up.

346
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,230
<12-2,ESPOSITO>你知道萨姆为什么去纽约吗
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Do you have any idea what Sam was doing in New York?

347
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,780
<12-3,CHARLIE>不应该啊  他讨厌那个地方
<12-3,CHARLIE>Wasn't like him. He hated the city.

348
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,240
<12-4,CHARLIE>汤米
<12-4,CHARLIE>Yo, Tommy.

<12-5,TOMMY MORETTI>You know what I need?

352
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,020
<12-5,TOMMY MORETTI>转转运
<12-5,TOMMY MORETTI>I need my luck to change.

353
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,220
<12-6,CHARLIE>一定会的
<12-6,CHARLIE>I'm sure it will.

354

<12-7,CHARLIE>大客户  有的是钱
<12-7,CHARLIE>Big whale, lots of dough.

355
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,600
<12-8,RYAN>昨晚给萨姆开车的拉夫·马里诺呢
<12-8,RYAN>What about Sam's driver last night--Ralph Marino?

356
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,850
<12-8,RYAN>你对他有什么了解
<12-8,RYAN>What can you tell us about him?

357
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,330
<12-9,CHARLIE>没什么  他只给我开过几次车而已
<12-9,CHARLIE>Not much. He drove me a couple of times.

358
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,990
<12-9,CHARLIE>这是你们要的他的人事档案
<12-9,CHARLIE>Here's his personnel file, like you asked.

359
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,160
<12-9,CHARLIE>说实在的  在他们之间发生过那件事以后
<12-9,CHARLIE>Honestly, after what happened between them,

360
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,970
<12-9,CHARLIE>我不明白萨姆为什么还继续把他留在身边
<12-9,CHARLIE>I don't know why Sam kept him around.

361
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,280
<12-10,ESPOSITO>发生过什么事
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Well, what happened?

<12-12,CHARLIE>my Security Tech Daniel Sullivan.

367
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,340
<12-12,CHARLIE>你们用来追查恐怖分子的软件
<12-12,CHARLIE>The same software you guys use to track terrorists,

368
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,150
<12-12,CHARLIE>我们用来揪出卑鄙的小偷
<12-12,CHARLIE>we use to track low-life thieves.

<12-13,CASTLE>看来你手腕挺严啊
<12-13,CASTLE>Looks like you run a tight ship.

372
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,920
<12-14,CHARLIE>人人都自以为能诈赌场的钱
<12-14,CHARLIE>Everybody thinks they can beat the house.

373
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,090
<12-14,CHARLIE>如果你不管得严一点  他们就明目张胆
<12-14,CHARLIE>If you don't lay down the law, they'll rob you blind.

374
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,410
<12-15,ESPOSITO>你刚刚说拉夫和萨姆之间有过节
<12-15,ESPOSITO>Well, you said something happened between Ralph and Sam.

375
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,400
<12-15,ESPOSITO>是什么事
<12-15,ESPOSITO>What was that?

376
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,290
<12-16,CHARLIE>大约一周前
<12-16,CHARLIE>About a week ago,

377
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,100
<12-16,CHARLIE>他们俩在吧台前打了起来
<12-16,CHARLIE>the two of them had a scuffle at the bar.

378
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,360
<12-18,CHARLIE>因为什么事  萨姆让一个舞者
<12-18,CHARLIE>About what? Sam asked this dancer to, uh...

379
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,930
<12-18,CHARLIE>给他"吹箫"
<12-18,CHARLIE>blow on his dice.

380
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,490
<12-19,CHARLIE>结果呢  她是拉夫的妞儿
<12-19,CHARLIE>Turns out, she was Ralph's girl.

381
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,610
<12-20,CASTLE>对啊  萨姆总是喜欢拈花惹草
<12-20,CASTLE>Yeah, Sam was always a ladies' man,

382
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,120
<12-21,CHARLIE>而且其中很多还名花有主
<12-21,CHARLIE>and a lot of those ladies were already spoken for.

383
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,060
<12-21,CHARLIE>貌似他最近连连得手
<12-21,CHARLIE>It seems like he was on a little hot streak lately.

384
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,360
<12-21,CHARLIE>但运气就是这样
<12-21,CHARLIE>But that's the thing about luck, huh?

385
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,040
<12-21,CHARLIE>我赢了
<12-21,CHARLIE>I won!

386
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,110
<12-22,CHARLIE>它会变化
<12-22,CHARLIE>It changes.

<12-23,ESPOSITO>We may need to interview some of your staff while we're here.

389
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,430
<12-24,CHARLIE>请便
<12-24,CHARLIE>Of course.

390
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,500
<12-24,CHARLIE>需要帮忙找娜蒂就行了
<12-24,CHARLIE>Nadine can help you with whatever you need.

391
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,920
<12-25,ESPOSITO>好的  谢谢
<12-25,ESPOSITO>All right. Thanks.

392
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,960
<12-25,ESPOSITO>伙计们
<12-25,ESPOSITO>Guys...

393
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,570
<12-26,RYAN>拉夫把他的表兄列为紧急联系人
<12-26,RYAN>Ralph listed--as his emergency contact--his cousin.

394
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,610
<12-26,RYAN>你们猜这位表兄住在哪儿
<12-26,RYAN>Guess where he lives.

395
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,240
<12-27,ESPOSITO>哪里
<12-27,ESPOSITO>Where?

396
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,650
<12-28,RYAN>纽约  离案发现场不过八个街区
<12-28,RYAN>New York city. Eight blocks from our crime scene.

397
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,660
<12-29,ESPOSITO>是拉夫绝佳的藏身之处
<12-29,ESPOSITO>Great place for Ralph to hide out.

398
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,300
<13-1,BECKETT>要出门吗  马里诺先生
<13-1,BECKETT>Going somewhere, Mr. Marino?

399
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,530
<13-3,COP>不许动
<13-3,COP>Hold it.

400
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,360
<13-4,BECKETT>举起手来  快点
<13-4,BECKETT>Show us your hands, now.

401
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,050
<13-4,BECKETT>我知道这看起来不妙
<13-4,BECKETT>I know how it looks.

402
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,080
<14-1,MARINO>但我发誓  人不是我杀的
<14-1,MARINO>But I swear to god and my mother, I didn't kill him.

403
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,470
<14-2,BECKETT>所以你裤子上别着把9毫米手枪
<14-2,BECKETT>That's why you run away from me with 9-millimeter

404
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,750
<14-2,BECKETT>一见我就跑
<14-2,BECKETT>tucked in your pants,

405
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,210
<14-3,BECKETT>是因为你是无辜的吗
<14-3,BECKETT>'cause you're innocent?

406
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,380
<14-3,BECKETT>得了吧  拉夫
<14-3,BECKETT>Come on, Ralph.

407
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,310
<14-3,BECKETT>我们知道你跟萨姆关系并不好
<14-3,BECKETT>We know that you and Sam weren't on the best of terms.

408
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,750
<14-4,MARINO>我们两清了  我绝不会伤害他的
<14-4,MARINO>He and I were square. I would never hurt him.

409
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,190
<14-4,MARINO>我只是开车送他而已  他被杀时我并不在场
<14-4,MARINO>Look, all I did was drive him. I wasn't there when he was shot.

410
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,900
<14-5,BECKETT>为什不在场  你不是他的司机吗
<14-5,BECKETT>Why not? You were his driver.

411
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,440
<14-5,BECKETT>那你做什么去了  半夜闲逛吗
<14-5,BECKETT>So what did you do, go for a midnight stroll?

412
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,540
<14-6,MARINO>说起来确实如此
<14-6,MARINO>As a matter of fact, yeah.

413
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,850
<14-7,MARINO>见完他前妻后  他便让我送他去
<14-7,MARINO>A-after he spoke to his ex, he told me to take him out

414
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,180
<14-7,MARINO>城市另一头的一个废弃的仓库
<14-7,MARINO>to this abandoned warehouse on the other side of town.

415
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,630
<14-7,MARINO>他说要在那儿见一个人
<14-7,MARINO>He said there was someone he needed to meet.

416
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,410
<14-7,MARINO>而且要单独见面
<14-7,MARINO>He said he needed to meet him alone.

417
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,820
<14-8,BECKETT>-见谁  -我也不知道
<14-8,BECKETT>- Who? - Don't know.

418
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,740
<14-9,MARINO>萨姆给我了我五百块  让我自己想办法回去
<14-9,MARINO>Sam gave me 500 bucks, told me to find my own way home,

419
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,260
<14-9,MARINO>所以我就去我表兄家借宿
<14-9,MARINO>So I-I crashed at my cousin's place.

420
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,220
<14-9,MARINO>今早我在收音机上听到了发生的事情
<14-9,MARINO>And this morning, I-- I hear what happened on the radio.

421
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:29,020
<14-9,MARINO>我猜以我的案底  警察必然会找上我
<14-9,MARINO>I figured, with my record, folks would be looking at me.

422
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,940
<14-10,BECKETT>你离开前有见到别的什么人吗
<14-10,BECKETT>Did you see anybody else there before you left?

423
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,540
<14-11,MARINO>我离开时看到一辆黑色SUV开过来
<14-11,MARINO>Black S.U.V. drove up to the dock just as I was leaving,

424
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,000
<14-11,MARINO>但是没有看清车里的人
<14-11,MARINO>but I didn't see who was inside.

425
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,400
<14-12,BECKETT>弹道科在给你的枪做对比
<14-12,BECKETT>Ballistics is checking your 9.

426
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,360
<14-12,BECKETT>你最好祈祷结果不匹配
<14-12,BECKETT>You better hope it's not a match.

427
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,240
<15-1,GATES>你觉得是他吗
<15-1,GATES>What do you think?

428
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:49,140
<15-2,BECKETT>我认为他知道自己必受怀疑
<15-2,BECKETT>I think he's not stupid enough to kill Sam,

429
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,110
<15-2,BECKETT>就不会傻到去杀萨姆
<15-2,BECKETT>knowing it'll just point right back at him.

430
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,450
<15-3,BECKETT>那么萨姆坐车来到纽约
<15-3,BECKETT>So Sam drove up to new york

431
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,730
<15-3,BECKETT>想要从前妻手中拿到皇后区的地产
<15-3,BECKETT>to secure the property in Queens from his ex-wife.

432
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,840
<15-3,BECKETT>然后去到码头去见一个人
<15-3,BECKETT>And then went to the docks to meet with someone.

433
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:04,040
<15-4,GATES>听上去像是有人等着接收那座房子
<15-4,GATES>Sounds like someone was expecting the property,

434
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,060
<15-4,GATES>萨姆没能把房子交出来  他们便杀了他
<15-4,GATES>and when Sam couldn't deliver, they killed him.

435
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,310
<15-5,BECKETT>为什么呢  这座房子到底有何特别之处
<15-5,BECKETT>Why? What's so special about that property?

436
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,110
<16-1,CASTLE>女士们  真是多谢了
<16-1,CASTLE>Ladies, thank you so much.

437
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,640
<16-1,CASTLE>你们绝想不到  我一定会物尽其用的
<16-1,CASTLE>You have no idea. These will not go to waste.

438
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,630
<16-1,CASTLE>多谢  听着  听着
<16-1,CASTLE>Thank you. All right. All right.

439
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,290
<16-2,CASTLE>虽然颇费功夫  但我还是搞到手了
<16-2,CASTLE>It was not easy, but I did it.

440
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,700
<16-2,CASTLE>我拿到了三张前排的
<16-2,CASTLE>I managed to get three front-row seats

441
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,400
<16-2,CASTLE>赌场喜剧演出的票
<16-2,CASTLE>to the burlesque show at the borgata,

442
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,720
<16-2,CASTLE>还在X俱乐部预订了贵宾桌
<16-2,CASTLE>Also reservations at a premium table

443
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,790
<16-2,CASTLE>以及酒水服务
<16-2,CASTLE>at the X club with bottle service.

444
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,130
<16-4,CASTLE>-很不错嘛  -你们查到了什么
<16-4,CASTLE>- Sweet. - What'd you guys come up with?

445
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,870
<16-5,RYAN>萨姆的助理完全不知道
<16-5,RYAN>Well, Sam's assistant didn't know anything

446
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,780
<16-5,RYAN>皇后区地产的事
<16-5,RYAN>about the property in Queens,

447
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,630
<16-5,RYAN>但是她提到昨天确实发生了点不寻常的事
<16-5,RYAN>But she did remember something odd about yesterday.

448
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,090
<16-6,ESPOSITO>萨姆按他的常规晨间安排
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Apparently, Sam followed his usual morning routine--

449
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,520
<16-6,ESPOSITO>先在宾馆作了按摩
<16-6,ESPOSITO>he had a massage in the hotel,

450
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,390
<16-6,ESPOSITO>然后与赌场经理开会
<16-6,ESPOSITO>then a meeting with his casino manager,

451
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,310
<16-6,ESPOSITO>午餐后  他回来时唇角带血
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Then after lunch, he came back with a bloody lip.

452
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,120
<16-7,CASTLE>怎么弄成那样
<16-7,CASTLE>How'd he get it?

453
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,940
<16-8,RYAN>萨姆闪烁其词  但是他的助理说
<16-8,RYAN>Well, Sam was evasive, but his assistant said,

454
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,030
<16-8,RYAN>看起来像是被人打得
<16-8,RYAN>it looked like someone hit him.

455
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,070
<16-9,CASTLE>所以萨姆挨了一拳  而不久之后
<16-9,CASTLE>So Sam gets punched, and soon after,

456
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,270
<16-9,CASTLE>他匆忙赶到纽约
<16-9,CASTLE>he rushes off to new york,

457
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,030
<16-9,CASTLE>急切得想要回那处地产
<16-9,CASTLE>frantically trying to get that property.

458
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,400
<16-10,ESPOSITO>再然后就被枪杀了
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Then he's shot dead.

459
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,930
<16-11,CASTLE>这其中必然有联系
<16-11,CASTLE>Well, it's gotta be connected.

460
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,630
<16-12,RYAN>问题是  我们并不知道这一拳是谁打的
<16-12,RYAN>The problem is, we don't know who threw that punch.

461
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,870
<16-13,CASTLE>我想我知道怎么找出那个人
<16-13,CASTLE>I think I know how we can find out.

462
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,920
<17-1,DANIEL>你是说昨天下午两点钟吗
<17-1,DANIEL>You said yesterday at 2:00 p.m.?

463
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,230
<17-2,RYAN>是的  没错
<17-2,RYAN>Yeah, that's correct.

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,870
<17-3,DANIEL>面部识别软件需要一些时间
<17-3,DANIEL>It'll take a second for facial recognition

465
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,790
<17-3,DANIEL>把西格尔先生从监控录像带中找出来
<17-3,DANIEL>to pick out Mr. Siegel in all the footage.

466
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,720
<17-4,CASTLE>你们会把以前顾客的数据保留在系统里吗
<17-4,CASTLE>Do you keep former guests in the system?

467
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,790
<17-5,DANIEL>当然了  这样才能标记出有前科的赌徒
<17-5,DANIEL>Sure do. That's how we flag gamblers with priors.

468
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,080
<17-7,DANIEL>-我呢  -我看看  理查德·卡塞尔
<17-7,DANIEL>- What about me? - Let's see. Richard... Castle.

469
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,540
<17-9,DANIEL>居住地  纽约
<17-9,DANIEL>Oh, resident, new york city...

470

<17-11,DANIEL>2003年妨害社会治安  拒捕
<17-11,DANIEL>Disorderly conduct, resisting arrest in 2003, and, uh,

471
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,620
<17-11,DANIEL>看来上回你来宝石蓝
<17-11,DANIEL>apparently last time you were at the Sapphire,

472
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,830
<17-11,DANIEL>一个无心之失
<17-11,DANIEL>you accidentally

473
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,480
<17-11,DANIEL>把床垫点着了
<17-11,DANIEL>set a mattress on fire,

474
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,610
<17-11,DANIEL>而且当时窗帘上到处是果酱什么的
<17-11,DANIEL>and the drapes were covered in jam.

475
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,580
<17-12,CASTLE>是呀  那真是个美好的夜晚
<17-12,CASTLE>Yeah. That was a fun night.

476
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,080
<17-12,CASTLE>记录属实
<17-12,CASTLE>Check.

477
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,970
<17-13,DANIEL>找到他了
<17-13,DANIEL>Ah, here he is.

478
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,240
<17-13,DANIEL>那是西格尔先生
<17-13,DANIEL>That's Mr. Siegel,

479
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,950
<17-13,DANIEL>下午两点  出电梯
<17-13,DANIEL>leaving the elevator at 2:00 p.M.

480
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,690
<17-14,ESPOSITO>他嘴唇已经流血了  能倒回到之前吗
<17-14,ESPOSITO>He already has a bloody lip. Can you back that up to earlier?

481
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,740
<18-1,BECKETT>长官  现在方便吗
<18-1,BECKETT>Sir, am I interrupting?

482
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,860
<18-2,GATES>正在察看皇后区那栋楼的租客背景
<18-2,GATES>Just running background on the tenants in the Queens building.

483
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,780
<18-3,BECKETT>我想我大概知道为什么有人想要萨姆死
<18-3,BECKETT>I-I think I might know why someone wanted Sam dead.

484
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,930
<18-4,BECKETT>根据银行记录  昨天萨姆从宝石蓝的
<18-4,BECKETT>According to his bank, Sam wired over $10 million

485
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,890
<18-4,BECKETT>商业帐户电汇出超过一千万
<18-4,BECKETT>out of the Sapphire's business account yesterday,

486
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,450
<18-4,BECKETT>将其洗劫一空
<18-4,BECKETT>wiping it clean.

487
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,680
<18-5,GATES>一千万  他汇到哪里
<18-5,GATES>$10 million? Wh-where did he transfer it to?

488
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,960
<18-6,BECKETT>一个开曼群岛的离岸帐户
<18-6,BECKETT>To an offshore account in the Caymans.

490
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,910
<19-1,ESPOSITO>看他在这儿  在赌桌边
<19-1,ESPOSITO>So here he is, parting ways with the pit boss

491
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,180
<19-2,DANIEL>与赌场监管人告别
<19-2,DANIEL>at one of the tables.

492
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,740
<19-3,RYAN>那会儿嘴唇还没破  请继续放吧
<19-3,RYAN>No bloody lip yet. Let it play, please.

493
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,470
<19-6,CASTLE>还有其他角度的镜头拍到吗
<19-6,CASTLE>Is there another angle on that?

494
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,900
<19-7,RYAN>那是查理·特纳  萨姆的生意伙伴
<19-7,RYAN>that's Charlie Turner, Sam's business partner.

495
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,480
<19-7,RYAN>为什么查理会打萨姆
<19-7,RYAN>Why would charlie attack sam?

496
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,590
<19-7,RYAN>我想我知道原因
<19-7,RYAN>I think I know.

497
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,990
<19-8,ESPOSITO>刚才是贝克特的电话
<19-8,ESPOSITO>That was beckett.

498
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,060
<19-8,ESPOSITO>萨姆·西格尔在挪用赌场资金
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Sam Siegel's been embezzling from the casino.

499
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,430
<19-8,ESPOSITO>而且已经盗走了上千万
<19-8,ESPOSITO>He's ripped 'em off for millions.

500
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,400
<19-9,RYAN>听上去萨姆想诈赌场的钱
<19-9,RYAN>Sounds like sam was trying to beat the house.

501
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,440
<19-10,CASTLE>而查理则严惩不贷
<19-10,CASTLE>And Charlie laid down the law.

502
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,980
<20-1,ESPOSITO>查理  你是不是有什么事忘了交待
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Something you forgot to tell us, Charlie?

503
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,230
<20-2,CHARLIE>生意伙伴也会有分歧
<20-2,CHARLIE>Business partners have disputes.

504
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,240
<20-2,CHARLIE>这不是大事
<20-2,CHARLIE>Doesn't mean anything.

505
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,380
<20-3,RYAN>那你们为什么起争执
<20-3,RYAN>What was it about?

506
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,010
<20-4,CHARLIE>关于新床单的品种有不同意见罢了
<20-4,CHARLIE>The thread count on the new sheets.

507
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,040
<20-5,ESPOSITO>不是因为萨姆从赌场挪用的一千多万吗
<20-5,ESPOSITO>Not the 10-plus million that Sam stole from the casino?

508
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,010
<20-6,CASTLE>你知道他在挪用公款
<20-6,CASTLE>You knew he was embezzling.

509
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,670
<20-7,CHARLIE>是的  我承认我知道  那又如何
<20-7,CHARLIE>Okay, yeah, I knew. So?

510
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,990
<20-8,RYAN>那就有一千万个理由杀了他
<20-8,RYAN>So it's 10 million motives for murder.

511
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,340
<20-9,CHARLIE>你们可能已经注意到了
<20-9,CHARLIE>You know, you may have noticed,

512
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,320
<20-9,CHARLIE>赌场里遍布了摄像头
<20-9,CHARLIE>we have a few cameras here at the casino.

513
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,730
<20-9,CHARLIE>你们大可以查看一下
<20-9,CHARLIE>Take a look.

514
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,510
<20-9,CHARLIE>我一直在这  而非在纽约谋杀我的合作伙伴
<20-9,CHARLIE>I was here, not in New York, killing my partner.

515
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,880
<20-10,ESPOSITO>是吗
<20-10,ESPOSITO>Really?

516
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,120
<20-11,CHARLIE>我觉得这一记右勾拳看上去像是个警告
<20-11,CHARLIE>'Cause that right hook kinda looks like a warning to me.

517
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,950
<20-12,ESPOSITO>你知道吗  在这座城市里
<20-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you know, this town...

518
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,320
<20-13,CHARLIE>不小心点  就会毁了自己
<20-13,CHARLIE>If you're not careful, it corrupts your soul.

519
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,150
<20-13,CHARLIE>萨姆和我已经是20年的搭档了
<20-13,CHARLIE>Sam and I were partners 20 years,

520
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,220
<20-13,CHARLIE>即便如此  他就觉得可以偷我的钱了吗
<20-13,CHARLIE>and still, he thinks it's okay to steal from me?

521
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,520
<20-13,CHARLIE>我发现他转出了一千万美金后
<20-13,CHARLIE>When I saw he'd transferred the $10 million out,

522
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,450
<21-1,BECKETT>就去赌场找到了他
<21-1,BECKETT>I found him on the casino floor,

523
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,070
<20-13,CHARLIE>结果他说他根本不知此事
<20-13,CHARLIE>and he denied even knowing about it.

524
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,940
<20-13,CHARLIE>换你你信吗  所以我给了他一拳
<20-13,CHARLIE>Can you believe it? So I punched him,

525
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,410
<20-13,CHARLIE>并告诉他  不管是不是朋友
<20-13,CHARLIE>and I told him, friend or no friend,

526
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:56,030
<20-13,CHARLIE>他都最好把钱赶紧打回我账户
<20-13,CHARLIE>he better have that money back in my account,

527
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,300
<20-13,CHARLIE>否则就让他一辈子不能走路
<20-13,CHARLIE>or he'd never walk again.

528
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,080
<20-13,CHARLIE>我一定是吓到他了
<20-13,CHARLIE>So I must have scared him,

529
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,360
<20-13,CHARLIE>因为几小时后我接到电话  他说
<20-13,CHARLIE>because I get a call a few hours later, and he said

530
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,800
<20-13,CHARLIE>他会在今天把钱打到我账户
<20-13,CHARLIE>he'd have the money back in my account today.

531
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,540
<20-13,CHARLIE>到了今天
<20-13,CHARLIE>And now it's today.

532
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,010
<20-13,CHARLIE>我朋友死了  钱还是不见踪影
<20-13,CHARLIE>And my friend is dead, and the money's still gone.

533
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,860
<21-1,BECKETT>他们查看了监控录像
<21-1,BECKETT>So the boys checked security footage,

534
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,800
<21-1,BECKETT>他们说查理一整晚都在赌场
<21-1,BECKETT>and they said that Charlie was on the casino floor the whole night.

535
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,010
<21-2,GATES>他也许雇了别人
<21-2,GATES>He could've paid someone.

536
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,660
<21-3,BECKETT>可能吧  但是为什么他还没拿到钱
<21-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but why would he kill Sam

537
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,390
<21-3,BECKETT>就杀了萨姆呢
<21-3,BECKETT>before he got his money?

538
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,000
<21-3,BECKETT>如果萨姆真的偷了
<21-3,BECKETT>And if Sam actually stole something,

539
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,880
<21-3,BECKETT>为什么不坐飞机逃去巴巴多斯岛
<21-3,BECKETT>why wasn't he on a plane to Barbados?

540
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,230
<21-3,BECKETT>为什么还要浪费时间来纽约
<21-3,BECKETT>Why was he wasting his time coming up to New York?

541
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,360
<21-4,GATES>而这一切又和皇后区的房产有何联系呢
<21-4,GATES>And how is all this connected to the property in Queens?

542
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,630
<21-5,BECKETT>我觉得我们还少些什么
<21-5,BECKETT>I think we're missing something.

543
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,750
<21-5,BECKETT>还缺少一些能够让萨姆看起来
<21-5,BECKETT>There's some piece of the puzzle that'll help make

544
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,650
<21-5,BECKETT>毫无规律的行为解释得通的线索
<21-5,BECKETT>all of Sam's seemingly random actions make sense.

545
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,090
<21-6,BECKETT>实际上  这种事
<21-6,BECKETT>Actually, that's something

546
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,740
<21-6,BECKETT>是卡塞尔最拿手的
<21-6,BECKETT>that Castle's pretty good at,

547
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,480
<21-7,BECKETT>看着已有的线索
<21-7,BECKETT>taking a look at what we have

548
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,660
<21-7,BECKETT>然后找出缺少的那一块
<21-7,BECKETT>and then helping to find that piece.

549
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,400
<21-8,GATES>卡塞尔先生喜欢
<21-8,GATES>Mr. Castle likes to throw

550
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,710
<21-8,GATES>丢出一大堆疯狂的理论
<21-8,GATES>a whole lot of crazy theories against the wall.

551
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,250
<21-8,GATES>真正的警探可没有那闲工夫
<21-8,GATES>Real detectives don't have that luxury.

552
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,060
<21-8,GATES>我们的工作是关注于事实
<21-8,GATES>It's our job to look at the facts.

553
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,240
<21-8,GATES>银行记录显示萨姆早上9点47分取走了钱
<21-8,GATES>The bank report indicates that Sam moved the money at 9:47 a.m.

554
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,600
<21-8,GATES>通过他们的网站上的电子转账
<21-8,GATES>Via electronic transfer on their web site.

555
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,550
<21-8,GATES>如果我们能查出在此之前萨姆
<21-8,GATES>Now if we can find out who Sam talked to

556
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,940
<21-8,GATES>和谁交谈过或见过面
<21-8,GATES>or met with right before that,

557
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,070
<21-8,GATES>也许就能搞清楚到底发生了什么
<21-8,GATES>we could maybe figure out what's going on.

558
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,680
<21-9,BECKETT>-9点47吗  -对
<21-9,BECKETT>- 9:47? - Yes.

559
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,450
<21-10,GATES>萨姆的助手给他安排了
<21-10,GATES>Sam's assistant has him...

560
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,880
<21-11,BECKETT>全身按摩
<21-11,BECKETT>at a massage.

561
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,410
<22-1,AMBER>对  西格尔先生昨天9点做了一小时的按摩
<22-1,AMBER>Yeah, Mr. Siegel had an hour session yesterday at 9:00.

562
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,490
<22-1,AMBER>怎么了
<22-1,AMBER>Why?

563
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,920
<22-2,RYAN>我们想要知道萨姆在按摩的时候
<22-2,RYAN>Well, we need to know if Sam made

564
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,580
<22-2,RYAN>有没有接打电话或者有没有
<22-2,RYAN>or received any phone calls or perhaps any visitors

565
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,560
<22-2,RYAN>来访者
<22-2,RYAN>during his session.

566
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,110
<22-3,AMBER>没有  他很专注地享受按摩
<22-3,AMBER>No. He was very focused on the service.

567
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,780
<22-4,ESPOSITO>安玻  我们知道他9点47分上网了
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Amber, we know he went online at 9:47.

568
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,990
<22-4,ESPOSITO>我们只想知道他在此前后有没有
<22-4,ESPOSITO>We just need to know if he made contact with anybody

569
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,500
<22-4,ESPOSITO>和其他人接触
<22-4,ESPOSITO>right before or right after.

570
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,130
<22-5,AMBER>我说了  他既没上网也没打电话
<22-5,AMBER>I told you, he wasn't on the phone and he wasn't online.

571
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,870
<22-6,CASTLE>现在的移动设备小巧玲珑
<22-6,CASTLE>Well, what with mobile devices being so small and slim,

572
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,080
<22-6,CASTLE>也许他就抓在手上
<22-6,CASTLE>perhaps he had it in his hand.

573
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,430
<22-7,AMBER>他的手  有其他事要忙
<22-7,AMBER>His hands were otherwise occupied.

574
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,750
<22-8,CASTLE>明白了
<22-8,CASTLE>Oh. Oh. I get it.

575
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,000
<22-8,CASTLE>是那种按摩啊
<22-8,CASTLE>That--that kind of massage.

576
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,370
<22-9,ESPOSITO>那么萨姆没有转账
<22-9,ESPOSITO>So then Sam didn't make the transfer.

577
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,360
<22-9,ESPOSITO>他没有偷钱  有人从他那里偷钱了
<22-9,ESPOSITO>He didn't steal the money. Somebody stole it from him.

578
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,970
<22-10,RYAN>安玻  我们想知道是否
<22-10,RYAN>Uh, Amber, we need to know if, um,

579
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,180
<22-10,RYAN>也许有什么
<22-10,RYAN>perhaps there was anything, uh,

580
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,760
<22-10,RYAN>也许  预约的时候有什么不寻常的
<22-10,RYAN>maybe, unusual about the appointment.

581
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,270
<22-11,AMBER>唯一奇怪的事情是
<22-11,AMBER>The only thing that seemed odd was that

582
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,800
<22-11,AMBER>那天早上是娜蒂打电话来确定预约
<22-11,AMBER>Nadine called that morning to confirm the appointment.

583
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,580
<22-12,CASTLE>娜蒂  那个私人礼宾员吗
<22-12,CASTLE>Nadine-- the personal concierge?

584
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,110
<22-14,RYAN>那有什么不寻常的
<22-14,RYAN>Why was that unusual?

585
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,560
<22-15,AMBER>通常是西格尔先生的助手来预订
<22-15,AMBER>Mr. Siegel's assistant usually books the appointment.

586
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,510
<22-15,AMBER>这是第一次娜蒂打电话来
<22-15,AMBER>This was the first time Nadine ever called.

587
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,150
<23-1,GATES>等下
<23-1,GATES>Wait a minute.

588
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,500
<23-1,GATES>你说她的名字是娜蒂·埃斯皮诺萨吗
<23-1,GATES>Did you say her name was Nadine Espinoza?

589
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,220
<23-2,RYAN>对  礼宾员  你熟悉这个名字吗
<23-2,RYAN>Yeah, the concierge. That name mean anything to you?

590
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,080
<23-3,GATES>埃斯皮诺萨

<26-3,ALEXIS>and it turns out, my dad's out of town,

621
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,020
<26-3,ALEXIS>所以家里只有我们了
<26-3,ALEXIS>so we have the whole place to ourselves.

622
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,540
<26-4,JULES>酷

<26-4,JULES>对了  米娜说她男朋友可能顺路来
<26-4,JULES>By the way, Mena said her boyfriend might swing by

00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,140
<26-4,JULES>给她送件外套
<26-4,JULES>and drop off her jacket.

625
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,600
<26-5,ALEXIS>他是不是跟布莱恩是朋友
<26-5,ALEXIS>Isn't he friends with Brian from homeroom?

626
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,530
<26-6,JULES>帅到爆的那个布莱恩吗  没错
<26-6,JULES>Hot-as-hell Brian? Yeah.

627
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,160
<26-6,JULES>他们要去电影院过兄弟之夜
<26-6,JULES>I think they're doing a bros' night at the movies.

628
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
<26-7,ALEXIS>也许我们可以把他们也邀请过来
<26-7,ALEXIS>Well, maybe we could invite them over, too,

629
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,730
<26-7,ALEXIS>一起在这儿看电影
<26-7,ALEXIS>all watch a movie here.

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,270
<26-9,ALEXIS>他是体优生唉
<26-9,ALEXIS>He's, like, a total jock.

632
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,630
<26-10,JULES>跟你喜欢的型完全相反
<26-10,JULES>Completely the opposite of your type.

633
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,230
<26-10,JULES>我知道
<26-10,JULES>I know.

634
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,820
<26-11,ALEXIS>他非常  不像阿什利
<26-11,ALEXIS>He's so... not Ashley.

635
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,620

00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,740
<27-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特说SUV的车牌是偷来的
<27-1,ESPOSITO>So Beckett says the plates on the SUV came back as stolen.

637
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,840
<27-2,CASTLE>很有可能是在萨姆被杀的
<27-2,CASTLE>Most likely the same SUV that was spotted

638
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,350
<27-2,CASTLE>那个废弃仓库被人看到开出来的那辆
<27-2,CASTLE>coming out of that abandoned warehouse where Sam was killed.

639
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,400
<27-3,ESPOSITO>如果是同一辆车  他们为什么要抓娜蒂
<27-3,ESPOSITO>If it's the same car, why would they want Nadine?

640
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,930
<27-4,CASTLE>因为不管怎么回事  娜蒂定是参与其中
<27-4,CASTLE>Because whatever this is, Nadine is knee-deep in it.

641
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,060
<27-5,RYAN>是深陷其中
<27-5,RYAN>Try neck-deep.

642
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,730
<27-5,RYAN>大西洋城警察让我检查了
<27-5,RYAN>A.C.P.D. let me check into

643
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,520
<27-5,RYAN>娜蒂工作包里的笔记本电脑
<27-5,RYAN>that laptop in Nadine's work bag.

644
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,950
<27-5,RYAN>我看了她的浏览器历史记录
<27-5,RYAN>I checked her browser history.

645
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,100
<27-5,RYAN>猜猜谁在昨天早上9点47分
<27-5,RYAN>Guess who paid a visit to the New Reserve Bank website

646
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,170
<27-5,RYAN>登陆了新储银行的网站
<27-5,RYAN>yesterday at 9:47 a.m.?

647
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,170
<27-6,ESPOSITO>娜蒂是我们要找的贼吗
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Nadine's our thief?

648
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,090
<27-7,RYAN>是的  礼宾员干了一大票啊
<27-7,RYAN>Yep, our concierge pulled quite a score.

649
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,680
<27-7,RYAN>她用萨姆的帐号登陆
<27-7,RYAN>She logged in with Sam's account information

650
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,250
<27-7,RYAN>转了一千万
<27-7,RYAN>and transferred the 10 mil.

651
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,940
<27-8,CASTLE>劫走她的人是为了要钱
<27-8,CASTLE>So whoever took her is after the money.

652
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,490
<27-8,CASTLE>他们本想跟萨姆要  没拿到
<27-8,CASTLE>They tried to get it from Sam. When that didn't work,

653
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,600
<27-8,CASTLE>就杀了他  现在又盯上了娜蒂
<27-8,CASTLE>they killed him, and now they've gone for Nadine.

654
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,740
<27-9,RYAN>但还是不知道"他们"是谁
<27-9,RYAN>Okay, but we still don't know who "they" are.

655
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,960
<27-10,CASTLE>能让一切都说得通的只有一个人
<27-10,CASTLE>There's only one person who makes any sense.

656
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,450
<27-10,CASTLE>这笔钱的主人
<27-10,CASTLE>The guy whose money it is.

657
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,290
<28-1,CHARLIE>我为什么要绑架自己赌场的礼宾员
<28-1,CHARLIE>Why would I kidnap my own concierge?

658
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,800
<28-2,CASTLE>因为你发现是她偷了你的钱
<28-2,CASTLE>Because you found out she was the one who stole your money.

659
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,280
<28-3,CHARLIE>娜蒂偷了我的钱
<28-3,CHARLIE>Nadine stole my money?

660
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,790
<28-4,RYAN>不要再装了  我们知道你已经发现了
<28-4,RYAN>You can stop the theatrics. We know you know.

661
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,330
<28-5,ESPOSITO>特纳先生
<28-5,ESPOSITO>Mr. Turner,

662
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,860
<28-5,ESPOSITO>你的赌场有很多辆黑色SUV
<28-5,ESPOSITO>your casino maintains a fleet of black SUVs

663
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,540
<28-5,ESPOSITO>来接送你的贵宾
<28-5,ESPOSITO>to shuttle around your high-rollers.

664
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,240
<28-6,CHARLIE>所有赌场都有  这证明不了什么
<28-6,CHARLIE>All the casinos do. That doesn't prove anything.

665
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,570
<28-7,ESPOSITO>那你肯定不介意让我们检查一下
<28-7,ESPOSITO>Well, then you won't mind if we inspect them.

666
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,420
<28-7,ESPOSITO>确认每辆车都没有嫌疑
<28-7,ESPOSITO>Just to make sure they're all accounted for.

667
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,660
<28-8,CHARLIE>到此为止了
<28-8,CHARLIE>We're done here.

668
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,920
<28-9,RYAN>什么意思
<28-9,RYAN>Excuse me?

669
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,860
<28-10,CHARLIE>你们从另一个州过来
<28-10,CHARLIE>You people are here from another state.

670
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,880
<28-10,CHARLIE>在这里没有管辖权  也没有搜查令
<28-10,CHARLIE>You have no jurisdiction and you have no warrant,

671
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,180
<28-10,CHARLIE>我想我对你们已经忍无可忍了
<28-10,CHARLIE>and I believe I've tolerated your presence long enough.

672
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,830
<28-10,CHARLIE>滚出我的赌场
<28-10,CHARLIE>Get out of my casino.

673
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:32,830
<28-11,CASTLE>你在开玩笑吗
<28-11,CASTLE>Are you kidding?

674
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,380
<28-12,CHARLIE>我像是在开玩笑吗
<28-12,CHARLIE>Do I look like I'm kidding?

675
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,050
<28-12,CHARLIE>给我立刻离开
<28-12,CHARLIE>I want you to leave now.

676
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,530
<28-13,CASTLE>他能这么做吗
<28-13,CASTLE>Can he do that?

677
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,380
<29-1,BECKETT>什么  你们怎么被赶出来了
<29-1,BECKETT>What? How did you guys get kicked out?

678
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,390
<29-2,RYAN>查理宣称要全力配合
<29-2,RYAN>Turns out Charlie's version

679
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,720
<29-2,RYAN>到头来也是有所保留的
<29-2,RYAN>of full cooperation isn't all that full.

680
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,780
<29-3,ESPOSITO>他赶我们出来
<29-3,ESPOSITO>The only reason he kicked us out

681
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,560
<29-3,ESPOSITO>是因为他才是幕后黑手
<29-3,ESPOSITO>is because he's behind the whole thing.

682
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,120
<29-4,BECKETT>但在他的赌场门口进行绑架
<29-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but kidnap somebody right in front of his casino?

683
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,380
<29-4,BECKETT>也太胆大妄为了
<29-4,BECKETT>That's a bit bold.

684
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,240
<29-4,BECKETT>如果他知道是她  他干嘛等这么久
<29-4,BECKETT>If he knew it was her, why would he wait?

685
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,500
<29-4,BECKETT>为何不在她当班的时候
<29-4,BECKETT>Why didn't he just grab her in the casino

686
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,840
<29-4,BECKETT>在赌场里截住她
<29-4,BECKETT>while she was on shift?

687
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,830
<29-5,CASTLE>有道理  我们说偷钱的人是娜蒂时
<29-5,CASTLE>Yeah, I mean, he did seem genuinely surprised

688
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,000
<29-5,CASTLE>他确实挺吃惊的
<29-5,CASTLE>when we told him it was Nadine.

689
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,280
<29-5,CASTLE>说不定他并不知晓
<29-5,CASTLE>Maybe he didn't know.

690
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,980
<29-6,ESPOSITO>但他是唯一有动机的人
<29-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but he's the only one with motive.

691
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,750
<29-7,CASTLE>也不一定啊
<29-7,CASTLE>Well, not necessarily.

692
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,650
<29-7,CASTLE>如果有其他人知道是娜蒂干的
<29-7,CASTLE>What if someone else knew what Nadine did

693
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,770
<29-7,CASTLE>并想得到这笔钱呢
<29-7,CASTLE>and wanted the money?

694
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,260
<29-8,ESPOSITO>那他们怎么发现的呢
<29-8,ESPOSITO>How would they find out?

695
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,970
<29-9,BECKETT>说不定是娜蒂说的
<29-9,BECKETT>Maybe Nadine told 'em.

696
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,160
<29-9,BECKETT>这就能解释电话记录了
<29-9,BECKETT>I mean, that would explain the phone records.

697
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,210
<29-10,RYAN>怎么说
<29-10,RYAN>How so?

698
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,990
<29-11,BECKETT>听着  我调出了她的电话记录
<29-11,BECKETT>Listen, I pulled her phone history.

699
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,630
<29-11,BECKETT>她在9点47分转账前后打了两通电话
<29-11,BECKETT>She called a number inside the casino immediately before

700
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,070
<29-11,BECKETT>给一个赌场内部号码
<29-11,BECKETT>and after making that transfer at 9:47.

701
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,450
<29-11,BECKETT>通过分机号码查到是一个叫丹尼尔·苏利文的人
<29-11,BECKETT>I tracked down the extension to a-a Daniel Sullivan.

702
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,320
<29-12,RYAN>丹尼尔吗  是查理的安保人员
<29-12,RYAN>Daniel? That's Charlie's security guy.

703
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,120
<29-12,RYAN>这就能解释
<29-12,RYAN>That would explain

704
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,970
<29-13,CASTLE>娜蒂是怎么拿到萨姆的密码的
<29-13,CASTLE>how Nadine got ahold of Sam's passwords.

705
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,210
<29-13,CASTLE>丹尼尔是她的同伙
<29-13,CASTLE>Daniel is her partner.

706
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,060
<29-13,CASTLE>他能监视赌场的每一个角落
<29-13,CASTLE>He's got eyes and ears all over that casino.

707
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,900
<29-14,BECKETT>好的  去问他话
<29-14,BECKETT>All right. See what he knows.

708
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,810
<29-14,BECKETT>没法问啊
<29-14,BECKETT>We can't.

709
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,270
<29-15,ESPOSITO>他在赌场里
<29-15,ESPOSITO>He's inside the casino,

710
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,320
<29-15,ESPOSITO>保安不会让我们再进去的
<29-15,ESPOSITO>And their security won't let us back in.

711
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,760
<29-16,BECKETT>按兵不动  我这就过去
<29-16,BECKETT>Okay, sit tight. I'm driving down.

712
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,130
<29-16,BECKETT>不  不用  贝克特  你不用过来
<29-16,BECKETT>No, no, no. Beckett, you don't have to do that.

713
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,630
<29-17,CASTLE>-不用  我们...  -我们能行
<29-17,CASTLE>- No, no, we got - We really have-- we got it.

714
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,990
<29-20,RYAN>她挂电话了
<29-20,RYAN>Yeah, she's gone.

715
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,190
<30-1,BRIAN>我跟教练说  如果我在3号位无人盯防
<30-1,BRIAN>So I told coach, if I'm open on the 3,

716
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,780
<30-1,BRIAN>控球后卫最好传球给我
<30-1,BRIAN>the point guard better feed me.

717
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,440
<30-2,ALEXIS>真的很有趣
<30-2,ALEXIS>That's really interesting.

718
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,990
<30-2,ALEXIS>但有必要把半支球队的人都请来吗
<30-2,ALEXIS>But did you have to invite half the team over?

719
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,180
<30-3,BRIAN>我喜欢你的头发  它是...
<30-3,BRIAN>I like your hair. It's...

720
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,000
<30-3,BRIAN>红色的
<30-3,BRIAN>red.

721
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,750
<30-4,ALEXIS>失陪
<30-4,ALEXIS>Will you excuse me for a sec?

722
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,260
<30-5,JULES>我得跟你谈谈
<30-5,JULES>Hey, I need to talk to you.

723
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,770
<30-6,ALEXIS>不能等等吗  有人把搅拌机弄坏了
<30-6,ALEXIS>Can it wait a second? I think someone just broke the blender.

724
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,610
<30-6,ALEXIS>这些人都是谁啊
<30-6,ALEXIS>Who are all these people?

725
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,700
<30-7,JULES>杰米·克鲁斯刚在脸谱网上更新了状态
<30-7,JULES>Jamie Cruz just posted an update on Facebook

726
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,530
<30-7,JULES>说你家开派对
<30-7,JULES>that you're having a party.

727
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,120
<30-9,JULES>-什么  -不过他是个衰仔
<30-9,JULES>- What? - He's kind of a loser, though,

728
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,040
<30-9,JULES>我估计他没什么朋友
<30-9,JULES>so I'm--I'm sure he doesn't have that many friends.

729
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,950
<30-10,ALEXIS>是啊  闲在家里等着有人开派对的人
<30-10,ALEXIS>Yeah. I mean, how many people are just sitting at home

730
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,470
<30-10,ALEXIS>又有多少呢
<30-10,ALEXIS>waiting to hear about a party?

731
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,320
<31-1,CASTLE>这是史上办案时最烂的即兴单身派对
<31-1,CASTLE>This is the worst impromptu bachelor party while on case ever.

732
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,730
<31-2,ESPOSITO>这太丢人了
<31-2,ESPOSITO>This is humiliating.

733
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,860
<31-2,ESPOSITO>我们可是纽约警局的凶案组警探
<31-2,ESPOSITO>We're homicide detectives with the NYPD.

734
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,450
<31-3,RYAN>不幸的是  我们在新泽西
<31-3,RYAN>Unfortunately, we're in New Jersey.

735
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,700
<31-3,RYAN>但至少眼下没什么急事
<31-3,RYAN>At least we're not on a ticking clock

736
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,750
<31-3,RYAN>虽然有个女人被绑架了
<31-3,RYAN>because a woman's been kidnapped.

737
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,670
<31-3,RYAN>等等  刻不容缓啊
<31-3,RYAN>Oh, wait. We are.

<31-4,RYAN>总归有办法能让我们进去吧
<31-4,RYAN>There's gotta be some other way we can get in.

739
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,500
<31-5,CASTLE>如果我告诉你们  我有办法
<31-5,CASTLE>What if I told you, I could get us back in the hotel,

740
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,240
<31-5,CASTLE>避过面部识别
<31-5,CASTLE>past security, all...

741
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,610
<31-5,CASTLE>通过保安  重新打入赌场内部呢
<31-5,CASTLE>while circumventing facial recognition?

742
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,080
<31-6,RYAN>怎么才能做到呢
<31-6,RYAN>How the hell are you gonna do that?

743
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,490
<32-1,SHOWGIRL>够帅气

<32-3,ESPOSITO>How do you know she wasn't talking to me?

746
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,460
<32-4,CASTLE>怎么  棕色皮肤当不了猫王吗
<32-4,CASTLE>What, Elvis can't be brown?

747
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,170
<32-5,ESPOSITO>我是拉丁版猫王
<32-5,ESPOSITO>I'm Elvez.

748
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,600
<32-6,ESPOSITO>嗨  你好吗
<32-6,ESPOSITO>Hey. How you doin'?

749
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,390
<33-1,DANIEL>搞什么飞机
<33-1,DANIEL>What the hell?

750
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,940
<33-2,RYAN>我们想跟你谈谈娜蒂
<33-2,RYAN>We'd like a word about Nadine.

751
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,350
<33-3,DANIEL>你在开玩笑吧
<33-3,DANIEL>You're joking, right?

752
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,300
<33-4,CASTLE>我像是在开玩笑吗
<33-4,CASTLE>Does it look like we're joking?

753
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,000
<34-1,DANIEL>好吧  你们干嘛穿成这样
<34-1,DANIEL>Okay. Why are you guys dressed like that?

754
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,650
<34-2,RYAN>更重要的问题是
<34-2,RYAN>A better question is,

755
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,530
<34-2,RYAN>娜蒂为何在昨天9点48分打电话给你
<34-2,RYAN>why did Nadine call you at 9:48 yesterday?

756
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,960
<34-3,DANIEL>被你们发现了
<34-3,DANIEL>You know about that?

757
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,130
<34-4,ESPOSITO>我们知道你们是同伙
<34-4,ESPOSITO>We know you two were partners.

758
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,650
<34-5,CASTLE>谁劫走了她
<34-5,CASTLE>Who took her?

759
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,120
<34-5,CASTLE>SUV里的人是谁
<34-5,CASTLE>Who was in the SUV?

760
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,680
<34-5,CASTLE>我不知道
<34-5,CASTLE>I don't know.

761
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,130
<34-6,DANIEL>事情不该发展成这样的
<34-6,DANIEL>I... this wasn't supposed to happen.

762
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,010
<34-7,RYAN>你是在说  你只是碰巧
<34-7,RYAN>Are you guys saying that you accidentally stole

763
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,420
<34-7,RYAN>从查理和萨姆那偷了一千万吗
<34-7,RYAN>$10 million from Charlie and Sam?

764
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,550
<34-8,DANIEL>没有  我们不想偷钱
<34-8,DANIEL>No, we didn't steal it.

765
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,270
<34-8,DANIEL>我们只想用钱作筹码
<34-8,DANIEL>We were--we were using it as leverage.

766
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,090
<34-9,CASTLE>让萨姆交出皇后区她父母住的那栋楼
<34-9,CASTLE>To get Sam to hand over that building in Queens for her parents.

767
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,400
<34-10,DANIEL>没错  但原因跟你们想的不一样
<34-10,DANIEL>Yeah, but it-- it's not why you think.

768
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,820
<34-10,DANIEL>几个月前  娜蒂和我开始约会
<34-10,DANIEL>Nadine and I started dating a few months ago.

769
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,250
<34-10,DANIEL>我们相爱了
<34-10,DANIEL>We're in love.

770
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,050
<34-10,DANIEL>我们想移居别处开始新生活
<34-10,DANIEL>We wanted to start over, move somewhere,

771
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,550
<34-10,DANIEL>可萨姆不肯让她走
<34-10,DANIEL>but Sam wouldn't let her go.

772
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,600
<34-11,RYAN>他们是一对吗
<34-11,RYAN>They were an item?

773
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,180
<34-12,DANIEL>不  是他一厢情愿
<34-12,DANIEL>No, only in his mind.

774
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,180
<34-12,DANIEL>她拒绝了他给的所有好处  可他不肯罢手
<34-12,DANIEL>She refused all of his advances, but he wouldn't stop.

775
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,740
<34-13,ESPOSITO>她为什么不举报他
<34-13,ESPOSITO>Why didn't she report him?

776
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,190
<34-14,DANIEL>因为这是他的赌场
<34-14,DANIEL>Because this was his casino.

777
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,160
<34-14,DANIEL>没人会把她的话当回事
<34-14,DANIEL>Nobody would've taken her seriously.

778
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,940
<34-14,DANIEL>她一年前试图辞职
<34-14,DANIEL>She tried to quit about a year ago.

779
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,170
<34-14,DANIEL>他就买下她父母住的那栋楼
<34-14,DANIEL>That's when he bought her parents' building

780
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,540
<34-14,DANIEL>并威胁说如果她不跟他上床
<34-14,DANIEL>and threatened to evict 'em

781
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,890
<34-14,DANIEL>就把她父母赶出去
<34-14,DANIEL>if she didn't sleep with him.

782
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,590
<34-14,DANIEL>我必须想办法阻止他
<34-14,DANIEL>I had to do something to stop him.

783
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,890
<34-15,CASTLE>所以你想到扣下这笔钱
<34-15,CASTLE>So you came up with a plan to hold the money hostage

784
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,330
<34-15,CASTLE>直到他交出房子的契约
<34-15,CASTLE>until he turned over the deed?

785
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,710
<34-16,DANIEL>他本来是要签放弃产权的合约
<34-16,DANIEL>He was gonna sign it over as a quitclaim,

786
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,010
<34-16,DANIEL>然后我会把钱转回来
<34-16,DANIEL>and then I was gonna transfer the money back.

787
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,930
<34-16,DANIEL>到时候娜蒂就自由了
<34-16,DANIEL>And then Nadine would be free.

788
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,400
<34-17,RYAN>可这也解释不了谁杀了萨姆
<34-17,RYAN>None of this explains who killed Sam.

789
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,670
<34-18,DANIEL>这笔钱让萨姆惊慌失措
<34-18,DANIEL>Something about the money made Sam panic.

790
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,840
<34-19,CASTLE>你什么意思
<34-19,CASTLE>What do you mean?

791
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,470
<34-20,DANIEL>当我打电话给萨姆
<34-20,DANIEL>When I called Sam to give him

792
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,090
<34-20,DANIEL>让他按我的指示解除契约
<34-20,DANIEL>instructions about the deed,

793
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,260
<34-20,DANIEL>他告诉我  我偷错了钱
<34-20,DANIEL>he told me, I stole the wrong person's money.

794
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,640
<34-20,DANIEL>他告诉我如果被他们发现  我们都死定了
<34-20,DANIEL>And he told me, when they found out, we'd all be dead.

795
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,510
<34-21,CASTLE>他指的是谁
<34-21,CASTLE>Who was he talking about?

796
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,900
<34-22,DANIEL>我不知道
<34-22,DANIEL>I don't know.

797
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,630
<34-23,ESPOSITO>嗨  各位
<34-23,ESPOSITO>Oh, hey, guys.

798
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,460
<34-24,ESPOSITO>我们正要离开
<34-24,ESPOSITO>Uh, we were just leaving.

799
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,390
<34-25,RYAN>这里不是舞厅啊
<34-25,RYAN>This isn't the ballroom. Huh.

800
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,320
<35-1,ALEXIS>我来猜猜  脸谱网上获悉的
<35-1,ALEXIS>Let me guess. Facebook?

801
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,500
<35-2,GUY>是推特  顺便说句  你还是把门开着吧
<35-2,GUY>Twitter. You might want to just leave this open, by the way.

802
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,780
<35-2,GUY>楼下还有一堆人
<35-2,GUY>There's, like, a whole bunch of people

803
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,110
<35-2,GUY>排队等着上电梯呢
<35-2,GUY>lining up for the elevator downstairs.

804
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,410
<35-4,ALEXIS>小朱  这简直是场灾难
<35-4,ALEXIS>Julie, this is a disaster.

805
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,620
<35-5,JULES>别紧张  开派对嘛
<35-5,JULES>Chill. It's just a party.

806
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,890
<35-5,JULES>你就好好找点乐子吧
<35-5,JULES>Have some fun for once.

807
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,890
<35-6,ALEXIS>找乐子  这里一半的人我甚至都不认识
<35-6,ALEXIS>Fun? I don't even know half these people.

808
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,440
<35-7,JULES>那么...
<35-7,JULES>Oh, what about, um...

809
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,880
<35-7,JULES>布莱恩呢
<35-7,JULES>Uh, Brian?

810
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,220
<35-8,ALEXIS>他的智商堪比松鼠了
<35-8,ALEXIS>He has the I.Q. Of a squirrel.

811
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,540
<35-9,ALEXIS>天啊  我爸爸会杀了我的
<35-9,ALEXIS>Oh, god. My dad's gonna kill me.

812

<35-10,JULES>拜托  你有这世上最酷的爸爸
<35-10,JULES>Please. You have the coolest dad ever.

813
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,130
<35-10,JULES>他要是现在走进来  我打赌他也不会介意的
<35-10,JULES>If he were to walk in right now, I bet he wouldn't care.

814
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,930
<35-11,ALEXIS>你说得对  他可能不会介意
<35-11,ALEXIS>You're right. He probably wouldn't care.

815
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,070
<35-11,ALEXIS>问题是  我介意
<35-11,ALEXIS>The problem is, I do.

816
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,430
<35-12,ALEXIS>各位  听好了
<35-12,ALEXIS>Everybody, listen up.

817
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,560
<35-12,ALEXIS>派对结束了
<35-12,ALEXIS>The party is over.

818
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,840

<35-12,ALEXIS>Thanks for coming, thanks for spilling,

819
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,580
<35-12,ALEXIS>感谢把全世界活着的青少年都叫来了
<35-12,ALEXIS>Thanks for telling every teenager with a pulse.

820
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,370
<35-12,ALEXIS>现在  所有人  请出去
<35-12,ALEXIS>Now, everybody, out.

821
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,770
<36-1,RYAN>不是吧  没搞错吧
<36-1,RYAN>Oh, really? Really?

822
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,100
<36-2,ESPOSITO>要不是扁你犯法  我扁死你
<36-2,ESPOSITO>If it wasn't illegal, I'd kick your ass.

823
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,230
<36-3,RYAN>他们把卡塞尔带哪儿去了
<36-3,RYAN>Wonder where they took Castle.

824
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,310
<1-1,CHARLIE>我警告过你再进赌场
<1-1,CHARLIE>You were told what would happen

825
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,370
<1-1,CHARLIE>会有什么下场
<1-1,CHARLIE>if you came back here.

826
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,840
<1-1,CHARLIE>可我也没蠢到殴打警察
<1-1,CHARLIE>Now I'm not stupid enough to beat on cops,

827
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,330
<37-1,CHARLIE>但是相反地  你就不同了
<37-1,CHARLIE>but you, on the other hand, are a different story.

828
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,000
<37-1,CHARLIE>我要我的钱  卡塞尔先生
<37-1,CHARLIE>I want my money, Mr. Castle,

829
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,390
<37-1,CHARLIE>你最好把你知道的一切都告诉我
<37-1,CHARLIE>So you better tell me everything you know.

830
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,260
<37-2,CASTLE>我知道那不是你的钱
<37-2,CASTLE>I know it's not your money.

831
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,410
<37-3,CHARLIE>让我们单独聊会儿
<37-3,CHARLIE>Would you excuse us?

832
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,420
<37-4,CHARLIE>谁告诉你的
<37-4,CHARLIE>Who told you?

833
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,320
<37-4,CHARLIE>没人告诉我
<37-4,CHARLIE>No one told me.

834
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,920
<37-5,CASTLE>我想明白了
<37-5,CASTLE>I put the pieces together.

835
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,460
<37-5,CASTLE>萨姆被杀  娜蒂被绑架
<37-5,CASTLE>Sam's murder, Nadine's kidnapping,

836
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,480
<37-5,CASTLE>如果是你的钱  这一切根本说不通
<37-5,CASTLE>None of it makes any sense if it was your money.

837
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,840
<37-5,CASTLE>你知道我怎么想吗
<37-5,CASTLE>You know what I think?

838
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,470
<37-5,CASTLE>我想娜蒂从你那儿偷的钱
<37-5,CASTLE>I think the money Nadine stole from you

839
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,160
<37-5,CASTLE>其实另有所属
<37-5,CASTLE>actually belonged to someone else.

840
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,440
<37-5,CASTLE>否则你也不会如此绝望
<37-5,CASTLE>Otherwise, you wouldn't be so desperate.

841
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,350
<37-5,CASTLE>告诉我  查理  发生了什么
<37-5,CASTLE>So tell me, Charlie, what happened,

842
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,030
<37-5,CASTLE>你和萨姆从一家不允许弹性还款的机构
<37-5,CASTLE>you and Sam take out a loan from an institution

843
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,280
<37-5,CASTLE>借了一大笔钱吗
<37-5,CASTLE>that doesn't offer flexible payment plans?

844
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,330
<37-5,CASTLE>你们从黑帮手里借了钱
<37-5,CASTLE>You borrowed money from the mob.

845
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,770
<37-5,CASTLE>所以你才不想我们四处查探
<37-5,CASTLE>That's why you didn't want us sniffing around here.

846
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,590
<37-5,CASTLE>我想不明白的是  你怎么会这么蠢
<37-5,CASTLE>What I can't figure out is, how could you be so stupid?

847
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,220
<37-6,CHARLIE>银行不肯放贷款
<37-6,CHARLIE>The banks weren't lending.

848
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,830
<37-6,CHARLIE>我们需要现金注入  否则就得关门
<37-6,CHARLIE>We needed a cash infusion, or else we would've had to fold.

849
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,330
<37-6,CHARLIE>现在钱没了
<37-6,CHARLIE>And now the money's gone.

850
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,480
<37-6,CHARLIE>你知不知道欠黑帮的钱
<37-6,CHARLIE>You have any idea how bad it is

851
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,850
<37-6,CHARLIE>逾期不还  后果有多严重
<37-6,CHARLIE>to default on a loan from the mob?

852
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,210
<37-7,CASTLE>他们怎么查到娜蒂的
<37-7,CASTLE>How'd they find out about Nadine?

853
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,490
<37-8,CHARLIE>我怎么知道
<37-8,CHARLIE>Hell if I know.

854
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,710
<37-8,CHARLIE>也许是萨姆告诉他们的
<37-8,CHARLIE>Maybe Sam told 'em.

855
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,420
<37-8,CHARLIE>我只知道
<37-8,CHARLIE>All I know...

856

<37-9,CASTLE>I can get your money back for you.

<37-9,CASTLE>但我需要你为我做点事
<37-9,CASTLE>But I need you to do something for me.

859
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,240
<37-10,CASTLE>那些人是谁
<37-10,CASTLE>Who are they?

860
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,890
<37-11,CHARLIE>不  没门
<37-11,CHARLIE>No. No way.

<37-12,CASTLE>They killed sam.

863
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,640
<37-12,CASTLE>找不回他们那笔钱
<37-12,CASTLE>And unless they get their money back,

864
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,930
<37-12,CASTLE>他们会杀了娜蒂
<37-12,CASTLE>they're gonna kill Nadine

865
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,200
<37-12,CASTLE>接着就轮到你

<37-12,CASTLE>这就是你手上的牌
<37-12,CASTLE>Those are your cards.

867
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,660
<37-12,CASTLE>你真的打算这么打吗
<37-12,CASTLE>Is this really how you're gonna play 'em?

868
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,250
<38-1,RYAN>很好笑哈
<38-1,RYAN>Um... Funny story?

869
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,350
<38-2,ESPOSITO>我们  是这样...
<38-2,ESPOSITO>We, uh, look, this is...

870
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,160
<38-2,ESPOSITO>我们可以解释
<38-2,ESPOSITO>We can explain.

871
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,240
<38-3,BECKETT>不用  我都不确定我想知道
<38-3,BECKETT>No, I'm not even sure I want to know.

872
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,700
<38-3,BECKETT>是卡塞尔的主意
<38-3,BECKETT>It was Castle's idea.

873
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,090
<38-4,CASTLE>而且很奏效
<38-4,CASTLE>And it worked.

874
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,040
<38-4,CASTLE>我知道谁杀了萨姆
<38-4,CASTLE>I know who killed Sam.

875
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,170
<38-4,CASTLE>谁
<38-4,CASTLE>Who?

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,920
<38-4,CASTLE>汤米·莫莱蒂
<38-4,CASTLE>Tommy Moretti.

877
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,850
<39-1,CASTLE>他六个月前借了一笔高利贷给宝石蓝赌场
<39-1,CASTLE>He made a hard-money loan to the Sapphire six months ago,

878
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,350
<39-1,CASTLE>现在到期了
<39-1,CASTLE>and it's due.

879
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,000
<39-1,CASTLE>娜蒂偷的是他的钱
<39-1,CASTLE>It was his money that Nadine stole.

880
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,060
<39-2,BECKETT>袭击重罪  蓄意谋杀  敲诈
<39-2,BECKETT>Felony assault, attempted murder, racketeering--

881
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,840
<39-2,BECKETT>联调局多年来一直想抓到他的把柄
<39-2,BECKETT>The feds have been trying to get him for years.

882
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,260
<39-3,RYAN>他今天早上还在酒吧
<39-3,RYAN>He was at the bar earlier today.

883
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,610
<39-3,RYAN>他告诉查理  他需要转转运
<39-3,RYAN>He told Charlie he needed his luck to change.

884
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,430
<39-4,CASTLE>也许是个隐晦的威胁
<39-4,CASTLE>probably a veiled threat.

885
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,800
<39-5,DANIEL>他要是把她杀了怎么办
<39-5,DANIEL>What if he kills her?

886
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,280
<39-6,CASTLE>不会  他太想要回他的钱了
<39-6,CASTLE>Nah, he wants his money too much.

887
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,760
<39-6,CASTLE>按计划行事
<39-6,CASTLE>Just stick to the plan.

888
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,220
<39-6,CASTLE>查理打给了莫莱蒂
<39-6,CASTLE>Charlie called Moretti,

889
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:24,910
<39-6,CASTLE>让他明早银行一开门
<39-6,CASTLE>told him to meet him at the casino,

890
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,870
<39-6,CASTLE>就来赌场见他
<39-6,CASTLE>first thing in the morning when the banks open.

891
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,330
<39-7,ESPOSITO>你把一千万交出来
<39-7,ESPOSITO>Once you turn over the $10 million,

892
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,300
<39-7,ESPOSITO>他就会交出娜蒂
<39-7,ESPOSITO>he'll turn over Nadine.

893
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,150
<39-8,BECKETT>然后我们就以谋杀萨姆的罪名逮捕他
<39-8,BECKETT>And then we'll arrest him for Sam's murder.

894
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,540
<39-9,DANIEL>要是他发现这是个圈套呢
<39-9,DANIEL>And what if he smells a trap?

895
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,640
<39-10,BECKETT>他不会的  我们会有所准备
<39-10,BECKETT>He won't. We'll be ready.

896
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,380
<40-1,RYAN>他来了
<40-1,RYAN>Here he comes.

897
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,670
<40-2,CHARLIE>汤米·莫莱蒂
<40-2,CHARLIE>Tommy Moretti.

898
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,450
<40-2,CHARLIE>这家伙是个反社会者
<40-2,CHARLIE>The guy is a sociopath.

899
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,300
<40-2,CHARLIE>问题是  半个城的人都靠他发薪水吃饭
<40-2,CHARLIE>The problem is, with half the city on his payroll,

900
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,740
<40-2,CHARLIE>没人敢碰他
<40-2,CHARLIE>no one can touch him.

901
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,320
<41-1,TOMMY>胆子挺大呀  小鬼  敢偷我的钱
<41-1,TOMMY>You got some pretty big balls, kid, to steal from me.

902
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,950
<41-2,DANIEL>我非常抱歉  莫莱蒂先生
<41-2,DANIEL>Look, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Moretti.

903
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,030
<41-2,DANIEL>我完全不知道那笔钱是您的
<41-2,DANIEL>I had no idea you were involved.

904
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,090
<41-2,DANIEL>只要我见到娜蒂
<41-2,DANIEL>I'll log on and transfer the funds

905
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,560
<41-2,DANIEL>就马上把钱转还给您
<41-2,DANIEL>as soon as I see Nadine.

906
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,900
<41-3,TOMMY>你活着就够走运了  小子
<41-3,TOMMY>You got a lot of demands for a kid

907
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,660
<41-3,TOMMY>还敢跟我谈条件
<41-3,TOMMY>who's lucky to be sucking down air right now.

909
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,150
<41-4,DANIEL>你说过会放了她的
<41-4,DANIEL>You said you'd let her go.

910
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,530
<41-5,RYAN>好戏现在才要上演呢
<41-5,RYAN>Okay, here's where it gets interesting.

911
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,880
<41-6,TOMMY>真奇怪  我就觉得事情不会这么顺利
<41-6,TOMMY>Funny. Somehow I figured I wasn't done.

912
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
<41-7,BECKETT>坐吧  莫莱蒂先生
<41-7,BECKETT>Take a seat, Mr. Moretti.

913
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,730
<41-7,BECKETT>我们有些关于萨姆·西格尔谋杀案的问题要问
<41-7,BECKETT>We got a few questions about Sam Siegel's murder.

914
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,530
<41-8,TOMMY>探长  我今天刚好心情大好
<41-8,TOMMY>You got me in a cooperative mood, detective.

915
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,050
<41-8,TOMMY>我的钱拿到了  有什么能帮助你的吗
<41-8,TOMMY>Now that I got my money back, what can I do for you?

916
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,060
<41-9,BECKETT>萨姆被杀那晚
<41-9,BECKETT>The night of Sam's murder,

917
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,360
<41-9,BECKETT>你在卡麦餐厅点了一份晚餐
<41-9,BECKETT>you charged a meal at Carmine's.

918
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,760
<41-9,BECKETT>距离案发现场只有一英里远
<41-9,BECKETT>That's about a mile away from the crime scene.

919
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,110
<41-9,BECKETT>为了份芝士烤鸡  还真是穿山越岭呢
<41-9,BECKETT>That's a long way to go for good chicken parm.

920
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,490
<41-10,TOMMY>我当时就是特别想吃
<41-10,TOMMY>I had a craving.

921
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,090
<41-11,CASTLE>是指意大利美食
<41-11,CASTLE>For good italian

922
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,000
<41-11,CASTLE>还是萨姆从你那偷走的一千万美金
<41-11,CASTLE>or for the $10 million Sam stole from you?

923
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,520
<41-11,CASTLE>拜托  如果是我杀了萨姆
<41-11,CASTLE>Come on. If I had killed Sam,

924
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,600
<41-12,TOMMY>我会让你们找到尸体吗
<41-12,TOMMY>you think you would've ever found the body?

925
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,770
<41-12,TOMMY>我不是你们要找的人
<41-12,TOMMY>The guy you're looking for ain't me.

926
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,600
<41-13,BECKETT>但你的确在那里
<41-13,BECKETT>But you were there.

927
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,720
<41-14,TOMMY>萨姆打了电话给我
<41-14,TOMMY>Sam called me.

928
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,350
<41-14,TOMMY>他说还贷遇到点麻烦
<41-14,TOMMY>He said he was having trouble repaying the loan.

929
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,160
<41-14,TOMMY>所以我安排了一次面谈
<41-14,TOMMY>So I arranged a meeting.

930
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,380
<41-15,CASTLE>可不  刚好是在像你这样的人
<41-15,CASTLE>Yeah, at just the kind of place

931
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,250
<41-15,CASTLE>喜欢射杀别人的地方会面
<41-15,CASTLE>guys like you like to put bullets into guys like him.

932
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,070
<41-16,TOMMY>从死人手里要不到钱
<41-16,TOMMY>You can't get money from a dead guy.

933
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,890
<41-16,TOMMY>我得先断了他的腿  把赌场收了
<41-16,TOMMY>I'd have broken his legs and taken his casino first.

934
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,450
<41-16,TOMMY>我知道勒索的事
<41-16,TOMMY>Now see, I knew all about the blackmail.

935
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,640
<41-16,TOMMY>萨姆跟我说过
<41-16,TOMMY>Sam told me.

936
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,040
<41-16,TOMMY>他说我根本不用担心
<41-16,TOMMY>He said I had nothing to worry about

937
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,140
<41-16,TOMMY>他前妻已经把皇后区的那块地签给他了
<41-16,TOMMY>because his ex-wife had signed over the property in Queens.

938
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,360
<41-16,TOMMY>勒索的人已经把那一千万转回来了
<41-16,TOMMY>The blackmailers were transferring the 10 mil back.

939
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,100
<41-16,TOMMY>他本要在早上把钱给我
<41-16,TOMMY>He was gonna drop off the money in the morning,

940
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,090
<41-18,TOMMY>所以
<41-18,TOMMY>so...

941
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,670
<41-19,TOMMY>我多给了他一天的时间
<41-19,TOMMY>I gave him an extra 24 hours.

942
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,360
<41-16,TOMMY>那就是我最后一次见到他
<41-16,TOMMY>It was the last I saw of him.

943
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,950
<41-17,CASTLE>但萨姆撒了谎
<41-17,CASTLE>Except Sam lied.

944
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,820
<41-17,CASTLE>他前妻并没有把那块地给他
<41-17,CASTLE>His ex-wife never signed.

945
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,240
<41-18,TOMMY>不  她给了
<41-18,TOMMY>Yeah, she did.

946
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,150
<41-18,TOMMY>他把签名给我看了
<41-18,TOMMY>He showed me the signature himself.

947
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,520
<41-19,TOMMY>那就是我多给了他一天时间的原因
<41-19,TOMMY>That's the reason I gave him the extra time.

948
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,750
<42-1,REBECCA>我没有说谎
<42-1,REBECCA>I didn't lie.

949
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,380
<42-2,BECKETT>那么萨姆离开公寓以后
<42-2,BECKETT>So then what happened to the paperwork

950
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,500
<42-2,BECKETT>那份文件是怎么处理的
<42-2,BECKETT>after Sam left your apartment?

951
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,740
<42-3,REBECCA>他带走了
<42-3,REBECCA>He took it with him.

952
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,930
<42-3,REBECCA>那就奇怪了
<42-3,REBECCA>That's odd.

953
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,370
<42-4,BECKETT>我们本以为会在他的尸体上找到文件
<42-4,BECKETT>I would've thought I would've found it on his body.

954
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,330
<42-4,BECKETT>但并没有
<42-4,BECKETT>But we didn't.

955
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,610
<42-4,BECKETT>这让我很好奇它的下落
<42-4,BECKETT>It made me wonder where it was.

956
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,840
<42-5,REBECCA>也许是杀他的人拿走的
<42-5,REBECCA>Maybe the person who killed him took it.

957
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,860
<42-6,BECKETT>是啊  也许是她拿的
<42-6,BECKETT>Yeah, maybe she did.

958
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,250
<42-7,BECKETT>警员在你家的垃圾桶里
<42-7,BECKETT>So uniforms found this

959
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,660
<42-7,BECKETT>找到了这个
<42-7,BECKETT>in your apartment's trash bin.

960
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,950
<42-7,BECKETT>上面有你的签名
<42-7,BECKETT>It has your signature on it.

961
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,760
<42-7,BECKETT>你说谎了
<42-7,BECKETT>You did lie.

962
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,540
<42-8,REBECCA>他恳求我...
<42-8,REBECCA>He pleaded with me...

963
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,100
<42-8,REBECCA>求我
<42-8,REBECCA>Begged me

964
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,540
<42-8,REBECCA>签了那份文件
<42-8,REBECCA>to sign that form.

965
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,740
<42-8,REBECCA>当我说不要的时候
<42-8,REBECCA>And when I said no,

966
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,610
<42-8,REBECCA>他掏出枪  放在我的嘴里
<42-8,REBECCA>he took out his gun, put it in my mouth,

967
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,330
<42-8,REBECCA>跟我说  如果我不签
<42-8,REBECCA>and told me, if I didn't sign the form,

968
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,150
<42-8,REBECCA>他就要我脑浆四溅
<42-8,REBECCA>he would paint the walls with my brains.

969
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,360
<42-8,REBECCA>我之所以能跟他离婚
<42-8,REBECCA>The only reason I was able to get that divorce

970
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,940
<42-8,REBECCA>是因为他说我已是个半老徐娘
<42-8,REBECCA>was because he said I had gotten old,

971
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,000
<42-8,REBECCA>他不要我了
<42-8,REBECCA>that he was done with me.

972
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,170
<42-8,REBECCA>我非常感激
<42-8,REBECCA>And I was grateful,

973
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,250
<42-8,REBECCA>得以逃出他的魔掌
<42-8,REBECCA>grateful for a way out.

974
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,080
<42-8,REBECCA>可一旦和萨姆这样的男人扯上关系
<42-8,REBECCA>But with a man like Sam...

975
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,280
<42-8,REBECCA>怎么逃也逃不出
<42-8,REBECCA>You're never really out.

976
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,970
<42-8,REBECCA>因此当他说
<42-8,REBECCA>So when he told me

977
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,070
<42-8,REBECCA>有人想要他的命时
<42-8,REBECCA>that someone wanted him dead,

978
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,130
<42-9,BECKETT>我想  我的机会来了
<42-9,BECKETT>I thought, here's my chance.

979
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,140
<42-9,BECKETT>然后发生了什么事
<42-9,BECKETT>So then what happened?

980
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,490
<42-10,REBECCA>他用我的电话约了那次见面
<42-10,REBECCA>He made a call from my phone about the meet.

981
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,620
<42-10,REBECCA>他走以后
<42-10,REBECCA>After he left,

982
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,540
<42-10,REBECCA>我拿出那把点38
<42-10,REBECCA>I took out the 38

983
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,920
<42-10,REBECCA>结婚两周年时他送给我的枪
<42-10,REBECCA>that he gave me for our second anniversary,

984
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,760
<42-10,REBECCA>从员工通道跟出去
<42-10,REBECCA>went out the service exit.

985
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,720
<42-10,REBECCA>像野兽一般猎杀了野兽一般的他
<42-10,REBECCA>And I hunted him down like the vicious animal he was.

986
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,610
<43-1,GATES>我已经请地检官
<43-1,GATES>I've asked the D.A.

987
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,230
<43-1,GATES>考虑减轻罪行了
<43-1,GATES>to look into the mitigating circumstances.

988
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,570
<43-1,GATES>他们给她认罪协议的时候
<43-1,GATES>They'll take her situation

989
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,960
<43-1,GATES>会把她的情况列入考虑范围
<43-1,GATES>into account when they offer her a plea.

990
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,120

<43-3,GATES>I enjoy checking out the view from the trenches

<43-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, it helps to be surrounded by a good team.

994
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,100
<43-5,GATES>你是指卡塞尔
<43-5,GATES>You mean Castle.

995
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,270
<43-6,BECKETT>是你说的  不是我
<43-6,BECKETT>You said it, not me.

996
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,350
<43-7,GATES>他不是警察
<43-7,GATES>He's not a cop.

997
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,360
<43-8,BECKETT>所以他才如此地出色
<43-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but that's what makes him so good.

998
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,270

<43-10,BECKETT>I gave them the afternoon off.

1001
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,970
<43-10,BECKETT>碍于莱恩的那位未成年伴郎
<43-10,BECKETT>Apparently, Ryan got stuck with an underage best man,

<43-10,BECKETT>so the boys are giving him the nunofficial bachelor party.

<44-6,ALEXIS>奶奶说需要它
<44-6,ALEXIS>Oh, I think Gram said she needed it
