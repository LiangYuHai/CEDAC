<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>I know what you're asking, and the answer is yes.

00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,020
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>和她的李尔王剧团跟你一起上大学去
<1-3,RICHARD CASTLE>and her entire production of "King Lear" to college with you.

18
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,430
<1-4,ALEXIS>我要发疯了
<1-4,ALEXIS>I'm going crazy.

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,180
<1-4,ALEXIS>耳塞
<1-4,ALEXIS>Ear plugs?

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,830
<1-6,ALEXIS>那个没用  我得找点事情做
<1-6,ALEXIS>Not that. I need something to do.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,390
<1-6,ALEXIS>照计划我本该在斯坦福
<1-6,ALEXIS>I had planned to be at Stanford,

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,420
<1-6,ALEXIS>可如今我只能干等着
<1-6,ALEXIS>but now I'm here, just waiting.

23
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,340
<1-7,CASTLE>学校的事怎么样了
<1-7,CASTLE>What about school?

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,240
<1-8,ALEXIS>学分都修完了
<1-8,ALEXIS>I finished all my credits.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,710
<1-8,ALEXIS>这学期我要上的唯一一个课程
<1-8,ALEXIS>All I'm taking this semester is...

26
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,940
<1-8,ALEXIS>是理论物理学
<1-8,ALEXIS>theoretical physics.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,860
<1-9,CASTLE>也许这就是你所需要的
<1-9,CASTLE>Well, maybe this is exactly what you need

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,180
<1-9,CASTLE>给自己一点时间  发现自我
<1-9,CASTLE>a little time off to discover yourself

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,880
<1-9,CASTLE>旅行  冒险
<1-9,CASTLE>travel, adventure.

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,860
<1-9,CASTLE>去积攒一点人生经验吧
<1-9,CASTLE>Go for a little life experience.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,400
<1-10,ALEXIS>这主意棒极了
<1-10,ALEXIS>That's a great idea.

32
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,000
<1-10,ALEXIS>我可以去实习
<1-10,ALEXIS>I could get an internship.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,720
<1-10,ALEXIS>在工作中获得实践经验
<1-10,ALEXIS>Practical experience in the job market,

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,230
<1-10,ALEXIS>试试水温
<1-10,ALEXIS>you know, test the waters.

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,250
<1-11,CASTLE>呃  我其实不是那个意思...
<1-11,CASTLE>Well, not exactly what I was thinking--

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,480
<1-12,ALEXIS>谢谢
<1-12,ALEXIS>Thank you.

37
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,570
<1-13,MARTHA>呼啸吧  狂风
<1-13,MARTHA>Blow, wind!

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,010
<1-13,MARTHA>雷暴  烈焰  是我的女儿们
<1-13,MARTHA>Thunder, fire are my daughters!

39
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,250
<1-13,MARTHA>女儿们呀
<1-13,MARTHA>Daughters...

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,320
<1-14,CASTLE>就是把李尔王逼疯的原因
<1-14,CASTLE>That's why King Lear went mad.

41
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,820
<1-15,CASTLE>在  你好
<1-15,CASTLE>Yes, hello?

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,430
<2-1,CASTLE>你来电的时间刚刚好
<2-1,CASTLE>Your timing was perfect.

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,640
<2-1,CASTLE>今天  我老妈在我家客厅里给三个
<2-1,CASTLE>My mother was teaching three acting classes today,

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,670
<2-1,CASTLE>表演班上课
<2-1,CASTLE>in my living room.

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,120
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>等等  她的工作室呢
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Wait a minute. What about her studio?

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,470
<2-3,CASTLE>被水淹了  她们本来在练习
<2-3,CASTLE>Flooded. They were doing

47
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,720
<2-3,CASTLE>李尔王里的"暴风雨"一幕
<2-3,CASTLE>The Storm from "King Lear"

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,050
<2-3,CASTLE>然后  水就控制不住了...
<2-3,CASTLE>and things got... out of hand.

49
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,850
<2-3,CASTLE>提醒我去查查我的保险
<2-3,CASTLE>Remind me to check my insurance.

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,230
<2-5,BECKETT>蕾妮  什么情况
<2-5,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie, what do you got?

51
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,310
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>劳拉·坎布里奇  二十八岁
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>This is Laura Cambridge, 28.

52
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,780
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>交警发现她在那辆车的乘客坐上
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>Traffic found her in the passenger seat of the car.

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,820
<2-7,BECKETT>死亡原因
<2-7,BECKETT>Cause of death?

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,450
<2-7,BECKETT>勒死的
<2-7,BECKETT>She was strangled

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,970
<2-8,LANIE>死亡时间在昨晚八点到十点之间
<2-8,LANIE>between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 last night.

56
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,210
<2-8,LANIE>这道淤青表明她被人用手臂勒住脖子
<2-8,LANIE>This bruising here indicates a choke hold.

57
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,530
<2-8,LANIE>他大概是从后面抓住她
<2-8,LANIE>He probably grabbed her from behind

58
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,970
<2-8,LANIE>然后用力压碎了她的舌骨
<2-8,LANIE>with enough force to crush her hyoid bone.

59
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,800
<2-9,CASTLE>他  这么说有目击者了
<2-9,CASTLE>He? So there was a witness?

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,940
<2-10,LANIE>没有  但能这么干净利索一招致命
<2-10,LANIE>No, but to kill her in one swift move like that,

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,440
<2-10,LANIE>凶手的体型必定比被害人高大
<2-10,LANIE>perp had to be taller and heavier than the victim.

62
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,320
<2-10,LANIE>可是没有性侵犯的痕迹
<2-10,LANIE>No signs of sexual assault, though.

63
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,620
<2-11,CASTLE>她是在车里被勒死的吗
<2-11,CASTLE>Was she strangled in the car?

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,430
<2-12,LANIE>鉴证组没有发现任何搏斗的痕迹
<2-12,LANIE>C.S.U. didn't find any signs of any struggle.

65
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,690
<2-12,LANIE>看来她是在死后才被人丢在这里的
<2-12,LANIE>Looks like her body was dumped here postmortem.

66
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,710
<2-13,BECKETT>这是谁的车
<2-13,BECKETT>Whose car is it?

67
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,570
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>不是她的
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Not hers.

68
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,590
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她的身份证显示她不开车
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She had a non-driver ID Card.

69
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,020
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>莱恩正在查车牌  看看能否找到车主
<2-14,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Ryan's running the plates to see if we can find the owner.

70
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,500
<2-15,BECKETT>包呢
<2-15,BECKETT>And what about the purse?

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,280
<2-16,ESPOSITO>被丢在垃圾桶里  但里面还有现金
<2-16,ESPOSITO>This was tossed in the dumpster. Still has cash in it.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,390
<2-17,BECKETT>手机呢
<2-17,BECKETT>Cell phone?

73
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,500
<2-18,ESPOSITO>没发现
<2-18,ESPOSITO>Didn't find one.

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,480
<2-19,BECKETT>二十岁的姑娘怎么会没有手机
<2-19,BECKETT>What girl in her 20s doesn't have a cellphone?

75
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,770
<2-19,BECKETT>德裔瑞士移民后裔组成的传统 严密的宗教组织
<2-19,BECKETT>拒绝汽车及电力等现代设施 过著简朴的生活

76
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,770
<2-20,CASTLE>也许她是个阿米什人
<2-20,CASTLE>Maybe she's Amish.

77
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,970
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>我查了这辆轿车的车牌
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>So I, um, ran those plates off the sedan.

78
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,090
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>这辆车...
<2-21,KEVIN RYAN>And, uh...

79
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,140
<2-22,BECKETT>怎么了
<2-22,BECKETT>What?

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,440
<2-23,RYAN>是属于市政厅车辆调配中心的
<2-23,RYAN>It's from the motor pool at City Hall.

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
<2-24,CASTLE>市政厅
<2-24,CASTLE>City Hall?

82
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,650
<2-24,CASTLE>最后使用它的是什么人
<2-24,CASTLE>Who used it last?

83
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,050
<2-25,RYAN>市长罗伯特·威尔顿
<2-25,RYAN>Mayor Robert Weldon.

84
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,040
<3-1,MAYOR ROBERT WELDON>得知我们的车被牵涉在这件事里
<3-1,MAYOR ROBERT WELDON>Uh, we're all still a little stunned to hear that

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,930
<3-1,MAYOR ROBERT WELDON>大家都震惊了
<3-1,MAYOR ROBERT WELDON>one of our cars was mixed up in this.

86
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,090
<3-2,CASTLE>相信我  我们会把事情搞清楚的
<3-2,CASTLE>Trust me. We're gonna get this all sorted out.

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,710
<3-3,WELDON>那是死者吗
<3-3,WELDON>Is that the victim?

88
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,740
<3-4,BECKETT>是的  劳拉·坎布里奇
<3-4,BECKETT>Yes. Laura Cambridge.

89
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,780
<3-4,BECKETT>你认得她吗  市长大人
<3-4,BECKETT>Do you recognize her, your honor?

90
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,350
<3-5,WELDON>我的下属大概会知道的更清楚
<3-5,WELDON>My staff would know better,

91
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,270
<3-5,WELDON>但我相信她不是我们这个办公室的
<3-5,WELDON>but I don't believe she's connected with this office.

92
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,290
<3-6,BECKETT>很抱歉  我必须的问问你  先生
<3-6,BECKETT>Sir, I'm sorry to have to ask you this,

93
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,140
<3-6,BECKETT>昨晚八点到十点之间  你在哪呢
<3-6,BECKETT>but where were you last night between 8:00 and 10:00 PM?

94
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,820
<3-7,WELDON>这位就是纽约市最出色的探长之一吗  里奇
<3-7,WELDON>This is one of New York's finest, huh, Ricky?

95
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,720
<3-8,CASTLE>她是最棒的
<3-8,CASTLE>She's the best.

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,500
<3-9,WELDON>你一直都是这么跟我说的
<3-9,WELDON>Yeah, so you keep telling me.

97
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,210
<3-10,WELDON>昨晚我在一个小型的集资晚宴上
<3-10,WELDON>I was at a small fund-raiser last night

98
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,340
<3-10,WELDON>大约有五十多人
<3-10,WELDON>with about 50 other people.

99
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,900
<3-10,WELDON>我会给你一张名单
<3-10,WELDON>I'll--I'll get you their names.

100
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,650
<3-11,BECKETT>好的  非常感谢  那辆车是怎么回事
<3-11,BECKETT>Yeah, I appreciate that. And what about the car?

101
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,110
<3-12,WELDON>那是这次活动中我们办公室用的几辆车之一
<3-12,WELDON>It was one of several used by my office for the event.

102
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,850
<3-12,WELDON>很显然  我的一名下属
<3-12,WELDON>Uh, apparently, one of my staffers

103
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,920
<3-12,WELDON>在当晚已经将那辆车报失
<3-12,WELDON>reported it stolen later that night.

104
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,570
<3-12,WELDON>私下说一句
<3-12,WELDON>Off the record?

105
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,460
<3-12,WELDON>昨晚跟我一起的那些人
<3-12,WELDON>The people I was with last night

106
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,750
<3-12,WELDON>是我内部关系圈的一部分
<3-12,WELDON>were part of my inner circle.

107
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,370
<3-12,WELDON>我们正在组建一个试选委员会
<3-12,WELDON>We're forming an exploratory committee

108
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,910
<3-12,WELDON>来看看竞选州长的可能性
<3-12,WELDON>for a possible run at governor.

109
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,080
<3-12,WELDON>但我现在还不想把这件事公布出去
<3-12,WELDON>But--but I'm not anxious to make that public yet.

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,670
<3-13,BECKETT>我会尽力
<3-13,BECKETT>I'll do my best

111
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,340
<3-13,BECKETT>不把这件事声张出去的
<3-13,BECKETT>to keep the nature of your business private.

112
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,930
<3-14,WELDON>谢谢  我真希望昨晚你也在那  里克
<3-14,WELDON>Thanks. I hoped you'd be there, Rick.

113
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,340
<3-15,CASTLE>昨晚是和阿丽克西斯的巧克力火锅之夜
<3-15,CASTLE>Fondue night with Alexis,

114
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,430
<3-15,CASTLE>但我的确寄了张支票过去
<3-15,CASTLE>but I did send a check.

115
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,700
<3-16,WELDON>非常感谢
<3-16,WELDON>Thank you for that.

116
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,290
<3-16,WELDON>我知道你还有许多疑问  探长
<3-16,WELDON>I know that you have a lot more questions, detective.

117
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,730
<3-16,WELDON>我的幕僚长布莱恩·谢伊
<3-16,WELDON>My chief of staff, Brian Shay,

118
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,660
<3-16,WELDON>会回答你余下的问题
<3-16,WELDON>will answer anything else you want to know.

120
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,990
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>你还在摇摆不定
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>You're swinging in the wind on this,

121
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,120
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>但如果你给我在委员会里多弄三票
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>but you get me three more votes on the council,

122
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,060
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>我就能送你架直升飞机
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>and I'll send you a helicopter.

123
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,370
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>你就是那位探长了  对吧
<3-17,BRIAN SHAY>You're the detective, right?

124
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,710
<3-19,SHAY>-是的  -请坐
<3-19,SHAY>- Yes. - Have a seat.

125
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,410
<3-19,SHAY>乔丹  这里不需要你了
<3-19,SHAY>Jordan, we don't need you in on this.

126
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,430
<3-20,WELDON>我就让你们自己处理这事吧
<3-20,WELDON>You know, I'll--I'll leave you guys to work through this

127
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,320
<3-20,WELDON>除非  里克你愿意来看看
<3-20,WELDON>unless, Rick, you want to take a look

128
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,840
<3-20,WELDON>我们的新图书馆建设方案
<3-20,WELDON>at our new library initiative.

129
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,510
<3-20,WELDON>万一你想支援支援  可就再好不过了
<3-20,WELDON>It wouldn't hurt us to have your endorsement on that.

130
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,970
<3-21,CASTLE>支援我最爱的纽约市立图书馆吗
<3-21,CASTLE>For the New York Public Library,

131
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,370
<3-21,CASTLE>一切都不是问题
<3-21,CASTLE>my first love? Anything.

132
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,040
<3-22,SHAY>我已经帮你干了跑腿的活儿  探长
<3-22,SHAY>I've already done your leg work, detective.

133
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,460
<3-22,SHAY>报失那辆车的人是伊丽莎白·沃森
<3-22,SHAY>The car was checked out by Elizabeth Watson,

134
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,970
<3-22,SHAY>我们办公室的高级通信处长
<3-22,SHAY>senior director of communication here at the office.

135
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,930
<3-22,SHAY>昨晚午夜时分  她离开活动现场时
<3-22,SHAY>When she left last night's event around midnight,

136
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,730
<3-22,SHAY>发现车不见了
<3-22,SHAY>she discovered that it was missing.

137
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,720
<3-22,SHAY>这是她的陈述报告
<3-22,SHAY>Here's her statement.

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,370
<3-23,BECKETT>恕我冒昧  谢伊先生
<3-23,BECKETT>With all due respect, Mr. Shay,

139
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,750
<3-23,BECKETT>警方的调查通常是由警务人员来完成的
<3-23,BECKETT>police investigations are usually conducted by the police.

140
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,180
<3-24,SHAY>是的  但很不幸
<3-24,SHAY>Yeah, well, unfortunately,

141
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,050
<3-24,SHAY>"二十四小时最新咨询"比你们的动作可快多了
<3-24,SHAY>the 24-hour news cycle moves a hell of a lot faster than you do.

142
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,070
<3-24,SHAY>在这事被曝出去之前
<3-24,SHAY>And I have to get all my ducks in a row

143
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,690
<3-24,SHAY>我要确保一切都妥妥当当的
<3-24,SHAY>before this thing breaks.

144
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,940
<3-24,SHAY>这就是我的工作
<3-24,SHAY>It's my job.

145
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,160
<3-25,BECKETT>我的工作是找出杀害劳拉的凶手
<3-25,BECKETT>And my job is to find Laura's murderer,

146
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,750
<3-25,BECKETT>因此你若是不介意的话  尽管你介意
<3-25,BECKETT>so if you don't mind, and even if you do,

147
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,520
<3-25,BECKETT>我得亲自再给沃森女士
<3-25,BECKETT>I'm gonna get my own statement

148
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,150
<3-25,BECKETT>做一份关于那辆车的陈述报告
<3-25,BECKETT>from Ms. Watson about that car.

149
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,520
<3-25,BECKETT>同时  我也需要关于你的下属们
<3-25,BECKETT>And I'm also gonna need statements

150
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,990
<3-25,BECKETT>是否认识被害人的陈述报告
<3-25,BECKETT>from all of your staff as to whether they recognize our victim.

151
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,930
<3-26,SHAY>请自便吧
<3-26,SHAY>Knock yourself out.

152
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,220
<3-26,SHAY>但相信我
<3-26,SHAY>But trust me,

153
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,660
<3-26,SHAY>你这是在浪费你的时间
<3-26,SHAY>you're wasting your time.

154
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,960
<3-27,BECKETT>我的时间我爱怎么浪费怎么浪费
<3-27,BECKETT>It's my time to waste.

155
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,390
<3-27,BECKETT>现在  我得干活去了
<3-27,BECKETT>Now I got a job to do.

156
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,630
<3-28,SHAY>我也一样  我跟你说清楚吧
<3-28,SHAY>So do I. Let me be clear.

157
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,260
<3-28,SHAY>我把威尔顿市长摆在凡事的第一位
<3-28,SHAY>Mayor Weldon is my priority.

158
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,700
<3-28,SHAY>我不会允许这事大振他对手们的士气
<3-28,SHAY>And I'm not about to let this thing embolden his opponents

159
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,070
<3-28,SHAY>并摧毁我们之前的一切努力
<3-28,SHAY>and ruin everything that we've built.

160
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,120
<3-28,SHAY>他说的有道理
<3-28,SHAY>He's right, you know?

161
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,050
<4-1,CASTLE>这事传出去  市长却没准备好应对措施
<4-1,CASTLE>This thing gets out, Major's not ready with a response,

162
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,620
<4-1,CASTLE>定会成为数周的封面故事
<4-1,CASTLE>that's front-page material for weeks.

163
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,540
<4-2,BECKETT>不管怎么说  它本就是个劲爆的新闻
<4-2,BECKETT>It's front-page news either way.

164
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,610
<4-2,BECKETT>如果他的下属想要把伤害控制在最小
<4-2,BECKETT>If his staff wants to minimize damage,

165
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,600
<4-2,BECKETT>他们就该老实呆着  让我好好工作
<4-2,BECKETT>they'll step back and let me do my job.

166
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,890
<4-3,CASTLE>老实呆着
<4-3,CASTLE>Step back?

167
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,270
<4-3,CASTLE>这帮人可是玩儿政治的
<4-3,CASTLE>These are politicians.

168
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,170
<4-3,CASTLE>就算去餐厅点菜
<4-3,CASTLE>They can't order at a restaurant

169
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,380
<4-3,CASTLE>也要威逼利诱一番
<4-3,CASTLE>without two compromises and an ultimatum.

170
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,590
<4-4,VICTORIA GATES>贝克特  来我办公室
<4-4,VICTORIA GATES>Beckett, my office.

171
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,890
<5-1,GATES>你在市政厅查到什么了
<5-1,GATES>What did you find out at City Hall?

172
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,260
<5-2,BECKETT>通报车被盗的职员
<5-2,BECKETT>The staffer that reported the car stolen

173
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,130
<5-2,BECKETT>负有丢车的全责
<5-2,BECKETT>is accounted for all last night,

174
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,340
<5-2,BECKETT>市长办公室也没人认识死者
<5-2,BECKETT>and no one in the Mayor's office seems to recognize our victim.

175
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,970
<5-3,GATES>所以死者和那车之间没有联系吗
<5-3,GATES>So her ties to that vehicle could be purely coincidental?

176
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,520
<5-4,BECKETT>完全有可能
<5-4,BECKETT>That's entirely possible.

177
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,740
<5-5,GATES>卡塞尔和市长是好友  对吧
<5-5,GATES>Castle and the Mayor are friends, right?

178
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,830
<5-6,BECKETT>长官
<5-6,BECKETT>Sir?

179
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,620
<5-7,GATES>这种调查就像是用液体甘油炸弹耍杂技
<5-7,GATES>These investigations are like juggling wet dynamite.

180
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,640
<5-7,GATES>一失手  你自己也会被炸的面目全非
<5-7,GATES>One misstep, and it'll all blow up in your face.

181
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,910
<5-8,BECKETT>我自有分寸
<5-8,BECKETT>I can handle myself.

182
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,190
<5-9,GATES>那就好  探长
<5-9,GATES>Well, that's good, detective,

183
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,650
<5-9,GATES>因为关注此事的人可不止我一个人
<5-9,GATES>because I won't be the only one watching.

184
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,920
<5-10,CASTLE>怎么了
<5-10,CASTLE>What was that about?

185
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
<5-11,BECKETT>权术之争
<5-11,BECKETT>Politics...

186
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,650
<5-11,BECKETT>还有你和市长的关系
<5-11,BECKETT>and your connection to the Mayor.

187
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,840
<5-12,CASTLE>那又如何  我们知道他与此无关
<5-12,CASTLE>Oh, what does it matter? We know he's not involved.

188
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,180
<5-13,CASTLE>怎么了
<5-13,CASTLE>What?

189
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,130
<5-14,BECKETT>她说得对  你在有意偏袒他
<5-14,BECKETT>She's right. You are biased.

190
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,480
<5-14,BECKETT>我偏袒
<5-14,BECKETT>I'm biased?

191
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,860
<5-15,CASTLE>你知道盖茨上次选举投谁的票了吗
<5-15,CASTLE>Do you know who Gates voted for in the last election?

192
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,570
<5-15,CASTLE>我敢打赌不是威尔顿
<5-15,CASTLE>Because I'm betting it wasn't Weldon.

193
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,440
<5-16,BECKETT>埃斯波  车辆调配中心进展如何
<5-16,BECKETT>Espo, where are we on that motor pool?

194
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,360
<5-17,ESPOSITO>已经核实了
<5-17,ESPOSITO>Verification.

195
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,520
<5-17,ESPOSITO>汽车是5点开走的
<5-17,ESPOSITO>Vehicle was checked out at 5:00,

196
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,190
<5-17,ESPOSITO>午夜刚过就通报被盗了
<5-17,ESPOSITO>reported missing shortly after midnight.

197
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,590
<5-18,CASTLE>所以是在街上被偷的吗
<5-18,CASTLE>So it was stolen off the street.

198
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,520
<5-19,ESPOSITO>看上去是如此
<5-19,ESPOSITO>Looks like.

199
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,910
<5-20,CASTLE>那就表明  和市政厅扯上关系
<5-20,CASTLE>Which means, any connection to the City Hall

200
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,320
<5-20,CASTLE>只是碰巧而已
<5-20,CASTLE>is entirely coincidental.

201
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,410
<5-21,BECKETT>莱恩  死者的电话记录如何
<5-21,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. What do our victim's phone records show?

202
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,760
<5-21,BECKETT>有打给市政厅的电话吗
<5-21,BECKETT>Any phone calls to City Hall?

203
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,000
<5-22,RYAN>没有电话记录
<5-22,RYAN>No phone calls at all,

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,050
<5-22,RYAN>劳拉·坎布里奇根本没有手机
<5-22,RYAN>Because Laura Cambridge didn't own a cell phone.

205
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,270
<5-22,RYAN>她的信用卡也已经半年没用过了
<5-22,RYAN>And her credit cards haven't been used in six months.

206
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,270
<5-23,CASTLE>没手机没信用卡
<5-23,CASTLE>No cell phone and no credit cards?

207
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,830
<5-23,CASTLE>她可不像是本世纪的人
<5-23,CASTLE>It's like she's from another century.

208
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,640
<5-24,ESPOSITO>阿米什人这个说法看来十分靠谱啊  老兄
<5-24,ESPOSITO>Amish theory's looking pretty good, bro.

209
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,880
<5-25,RYAN>要是能那么简单就好了
<5-25,RYAN>Be nice if it were that easy.

210
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,500
<5-25,RYAN>但我觉得她这事没那么简单
<5-25,RYAN>But I think something else was going on with her.

211
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,190
<5-26,BECKETT>什么意思
<5-26,BECKETT>What do you mean?

212
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,630
<5-27,RYAN>劳拉曾是哈德逊大学的文学教授
<5-27,RYAN>Laura was a Professor of Literature at Hudson University.

213
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,750
<5-27,RYAN>直到半年前她还是学院的后起之秀
<5-27,RYAN>She was a rising star in her department until six months ago.

214
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,820
<5-28,CASTLE>半年前发生了什么吗
<5-28,CASTLE>What happened six months ago?

215
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,180
<5-29,RYAN>她辞职了  原因不明
<5-29,RYAN>She quit for no apparent reason.

216
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,140
<5-29,RYAN>据她同事说
<5-29,RYAN>According to her colleagues,

217
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,040
<5-29,RYAN>她也同他们断绝了联系
<5-29,RYAN>she also completely cut ties with them,

218
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,130
<5-29,RYAN>注销了手机和信用卡
<5-29,RYAN>canceled her cell phone, cut off her credit cards.

219
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,780
<5-30,BECKETT>为什么
<5-30,BECKETT>Why?

220
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,900
<5-31,RYAN>没人知道  感觉是她出了什么事
<5-31,RYAN>No one knows. It's like something happened to her.

221
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,370
<5-31,RYAN>之后我能找到的就是
<5-31,RYAN>After that, all I could find were paystubs

222
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,480
<5-31,RYAN>来自快餐店  洗衣店
<5-31,RYAN>for fast-food restaurants, a laundry service,

223
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,710
<5-31,RYAN>办公楼清洁公司的薪水支票了
<5-31,RYAN>and an office cleaning company.

224
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,120
<5-31,RYAN>她好像无法长久地干一份工作
<5-31,RYAN>It's like she couldn't keep a job.

225
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,890
<5-32,CASTLE>她从教授
<5-32,CASTLE>She went from professor

226
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,030
<5-32,CASTLE>跳槽到清洁工
<5-32,CASTLE>to janitor?

227
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,730
<5-32,CASTLE>这像是《心灵捕手》的反转版本
<5-32,CASTLE>That's "Good Will Hunting" but in reverse.

228
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,510
<5-33,BECKETT>也许她的家人能透露点情况
<5-33,BECKETT>Maybe her family can shed some light.

229
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,860
<5-34,ESPOSITO>我查到了她的亲属
<5-34,ESPOSITO>Well, I tracked down her next of kin.

230
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,730
<5-34,ESPOSITO>她有个姐姐  正在来警局的路上
<5-34,ESPOSITO>She has a sister. She's on her way in now.

231
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,020
<5-35,BECKETT>很好  你们仔细查探一下她的生活
<5-35,BECKETT>All right, you guys dig in to her life,

232
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,620
<5-35,BECKETT>看看出事那晚她去了哪里
<5-35,BECKETT>see if we can find out where she was the night she died.

233
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,180
<5-35,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我会搜索她的公寓
<5-35,BECKETT>Castle and I will go over to her apartment

234
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,170
<5-35,BECKETT>看能否查出她是和谁在一起
<5-35,BECKETT>to see if we can find out who she was with.

235
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,520
<6-1,HARVEY>老实说  她不怎么和人交流
<6-1,HARVEY>Well, honestly, she pretty much kept to herself.

236
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,520
<6-1,HARVEY>她不拖欠房租  这就够了
<6-1,HARVEY>She paid on time. That's what matters.

237
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,610
<6-1,HARVEY>那是我的东西  你拿了我的东西
<6-1,HARVEY>That's my stuff! You took my stuff!

238
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,120
<6-1,HARVEY>不像这两个傻瓜
<6-1,HARVEY>Unlike those two chuckleheads.

239
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,480
<6-1,HARVEY>不好意思  警官
<6-1,HARVEY>Uh, excuse me, please, officer,

240
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,220
<6-1,HARVEY>不好意思  先生
<6-1,HARVEY>and, uh, gentleman.

241

<6-2,HARVEY>Hey, pipe down, for crying out loud!

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,250
<6-3,CASTLE>"警官与先生"
<6-3,CASTLE>"Officer and a gentleman."

243
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,230
<6-3,CASTLE>这可以作为我们罪案博客的名称
<6-3,CASTLE>That could be the name of our crime blog.

244
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,260
<6-3,CASTLE>罪案博客
<6-3,CASTLE>Crime blog?

245
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,520
<6-4,BECKETT>就像你帮我写警察报告那样吗
<6-4,BECKETT>The way that you help me write police reports?

246
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,820
<6-4,BECKETT>我看最后还得靠我自己写吧
<6-4,BECKETT>Got a feeling I'll be writing that one on my own.

247
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,030
<6-5,BECKETT>看起来没有打斗的痕迹
<6-5,BECKETT>Doesn't really seem to be any signs of struggle.

248
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,290
<6-6,CASTLE>没错  也没有电脑和电视

249
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,540
<6-6,CASTLE>很奇怪对吧
<6-6,CASTLE>That's weird, right?

250

<6-7,HARVEY>一群拖欠房租的家伙
<6-7,HARVEY>Bunch of deadbeat tenants in here.

<7-6,ROBERTA>into that flophouse.

284
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,780
<7-7,RYAN>你知道原因吗
<7-7,RYAN>Do you have any idea why?

289
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,900
<7-10,ESPOSITO>她连电话都没有
<7-10,ESPOSITO>She didn't have a phone.

290
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,160
<7-11,ROBERTA>我不知道  可她情绪低落
<7-11,ROBERTA>I don't know, but she was upset.

291
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,420
<7-11,ROBERTA>她说她因为工作上的事
<7-11,ROBERTA>She said she was in trouble

292
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,540
<7-11,ROBERTA>陷入了麻烦
<7-11,ROBERTA>because of something that happened at work.

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,350
<7-13,ROBERTA>没有  她说太危险了不能告诉我
<7-13,ROBERTA>No. She said it was too dangerous for me to know.

295
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,200
<8-1,CASTLE>所以劳拉·坎布里奇为了廉租房
<8-1,CASTLE>So Laura Cambridge left a tenure-track position

296
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,380
<8-1,CASTLE>和给她带来重重麻烦的神秘夜间工作
<8-1,CASTLE>at a respected university for some flophouse

297
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,750
<8-1,CASTLE>辞去了在知名大学的终身教职
<8-1,CASTLE>and a mysterious night job that got her into so much trouble,

298
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,120
<8-1,CASTLE>最终惨遭杀害
<8-1,CASTLE>she ended up murdered.

299
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,550
<8-1,CASTLE>她到底卷入了什么事呢
<8-1,CASTLE>What the hell was she mixed up in?

300
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,130
<8-2,BECKETT>那个从她公寓出来的男人
<8-2,BECKETT>The man who left her apartment--

301
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,330
<8-2,BECKETT>如果他是凶手  他是在找她
<8-2,BECKETT>if he's our killer, he was looking for her.

302
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,060
<8-2,BECKETT>他很可能去工作的地方找她了
<8-2,BECKETT>He probably went to her work to find her.

303
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,120
<8-3,CASTLE>这就表示  不管那是哪里
<8-3,CASTLE>Which means, wherever that is,

304
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,500
<8-3,CASTLE>那大概是她生前最后出现的地方
<8-3,CASTLE>it's probably the last place she was seen alive.

305
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,480
<8-4,RYAN>我查到了 我查到她在哪上班了

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
<8-4,RYAN>我还得在全市的商业登记处仔细查找一下
<8-4,RYAN>Now I had to dig deep within the city's business registries,

309
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,200
<8-4,RYAN>不过我找到了一家D.A.G.公司

<12-11,BECKETT>找你帮什么忙
<12-11,BECKETT>What kind of help could you have given her?

443
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,550
<12-12,EDGAR>我在牢内学会了如何修电脑
<12-12,EDGAR>I learned how to fix computers in prison.

444
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,270
<12-12,EDGAR>这也是劳拉给我打电话的原因
<12-12,EDGAR>That's why Laura called me.

445
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,240
<12-12,EDGAR>她要我从她硬盘复制一些
<12-12,EDGAR>She needed me to copy some digital recordings for her

446
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,170
<12-12,EDGAR>录音文件
<12-12,EDGAR>from their hard drive,

447
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,670
<12-12,EDGAR>但她不知道怎么操作
<12-12,EDGAR>But she didn't know how to rip them.

448
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,380
<12-12,EDGAR>我告诉她我需要文件扩展名
<12-12,EDGAR>I told her I needed the file extensions.

449
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,530
<12-12,EDGAR>她说拿到后用手机给我电话
<12-12,EDGAR>She said she'd get them and then call me from her cell

450
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,240
<12-12,EDGAR>教她怎么做
<12-12,EDGAR>to work her through it--

451
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,280
<12-13,BECKETT>她没有手机  埃德加
<12-13,BECKETT>Only she didn't even own a cell, Edgar.

452
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,110
<12-14,EDGAR>她有的
<12-14,EDGAR>Yes, she did.

453
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,170
<12-14,EDGAR>这就是她的号码
<12-14,EDGAR>That's her number right there.

454
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,690
<12-15,BECKETT>她告诉你她为什么要复制那些文件吗
<12-15,BECKETT>Did she tell you why she needed those files copied?

455
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,370
<12-16,EDGAR>她说在电话里听到了
<12-16,EDGAR>She said she'd heard something on a call,

456
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,120
<12-16,EDGAR>一些不该知道的事
<12-16,EDGAR>something she wasn't supposed to hear...

457
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,050
<12-16,EDGAR>不好的事
<12-16,EDGAR>Something bad.

458
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,680
<12-16,EDGAR>她需要复制一份做证据
<12-16,EDGAR>She said she needed a copy of it for evidence.

459
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,630
<13-1,BECKETT>所以劳拉从没提过让她惊惶的
<13-1,BECKETT>So Laura never mentioned a call that

460
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,710
<13-1,BECKETT>那个电话吗
<13-1,BECKETT>upset or concerned her?

461
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,890
<13-2,MARILYN>一个字都没提过
<13-2,MARILYN>She never said a word.

462
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,640
<13-3,CASTLE>她也没有要过录音的副本吗
<13-3,CASTLE>And she never asked for copies of recordings?

463
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,160
<13-4,MARILYN>没有  副本都在我这里
<13-4,MARILYN>No, and I'm the one to ask.

464
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,820
<13-4,MARILYN>电脑室一直锁着
<13-4,MARILYN>This computer room is locked up tight,

465
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,020
<13-4,MARILYN>只有我钥匙
<13-4,MARILYN>and I'm the only one with a key.

466
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,630
<13-5,MARILYN>锁被撬开了
<13-5,MARILYN>The lock's broken.

467
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,850
<13-6,BECKETT>进来吧
<13-6,BECKETT>Okay.

468
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,220
<13-7,MARILYN>硬盘不见了
<13-7,MARILYN>The hard drive's gone.

469
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,190
<13-7,MARILYN>上两月的来电记录都在那个硬盘里
<13-7,MARILYN>All of our calls for the last two months were on that drive.

470
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,590
<13-8,BECKETT>你最近一次进来是什么时候
<13-8,BECKETT>When was the last time you were in here?

471
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,910
<13-9,MARILYN>今天早上  一切还好好的
<13-9,MARILYN>This morning. Everything was fine.

472
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,500
<13-9,MARILYN>这肯定是才发生的
<13-9,MARILYN>This must've just happened.

473
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,310
<13-10,BECKETT>今天有谁来过办公室吗
<13-10,BECKETT>Has anyone visited the office today?

474
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,650
<13-10,BECKETT>有  一个...
<13-10,BECKETT>Yes, a...

475
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,910
<13-11,MARILYN>一个煤气公司的人
<13-11,MARILYN>A man from the gas company.

476
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,160
<13-11,MARILYN>他说因为施工
<13-11,MARILYN>He said there was a leak in the building

477
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,190
<13-11,MARILYN>大楼里有煤气泄漏
<13-11,MARILYN>because of the construction.

478
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,220
<13-12,CASTLE>你能描述下他的样子吗
<13-12,CASTLE>Can you describe him?

479
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,280
<13-13,MARILYN>大概六英尺高  白人  深色头发
<13-13,MARILYN>Um, about 6 feet tall, white, dark hair.

480
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,250
<13-14,CASTLE>和劳拉遇害那晚出现在她公寓的是同一个家伙
<13-14,CASTLE>Same guy who was at Laura's apartment the night she died?

481
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,150
<13-15,BECKETT>那录音带上到底有什么
<13-15,BECKETT>What the hell was on that recording?

482
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,010
<13-16,CASTLE>不管是什么
<13-16,CASTLE>Whatever it is...

483
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,810
<13-16,CASTLE>都值得为之杀人
<13-16,CASTLE>It's worth killing for.

484
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:04,930
<13-16,CASTLE>那个知道了太多的
<13-16,CASTLE>So how is the case

485
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,750
<14-1,MARTHA>色情电话女孩的案子怎么样了
<14-1,MARTHA>of the phone sex gal who knew too much going?

486
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,260
<14-2,CASTLE>有点阴谋惊悚片的感觉
<14-2,CASTLE>It's more of a conspiracy thriller,

487
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,940
<14-2,CASTLE>像是《窃听大阴谋》或是《凶线》
<14-2,CASTLE>like, uh, "The Conversation" or "Blow Out."

488
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,550
<14-4,CASTLE>所有人都想得到那录音带和上面的秘密
<14-4,CASTLE>Everyone wants this recording and the secrets on it.

489
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,830
<14-5,MARTHA>非常神秘嘛
<14-5,MARTHA>Oh, very mysterious.

490
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,490
<14-6,CASTLE>是的  神秘的还不止这些
<14-6,CASTLE>Yeah, and that's not the only mystery.

491
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,950
<14-6,CASTLE>为什么一个像劳拉·坎布里奇的女人
<14-6,CASTLE>Why would a woman like Laura Cambridge,

492
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,950
<14-6,CASTLE>一位高学历的教授
<14-6,CASTLE>a highly educated professor,

493
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,410
<14-6,CASTLE>会突然之间放弃她的生活中的一切
<14-6,CASTLE>suddenly quit everything and just drop out of her life

494
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,360
<14-6,CASTLE>去做那些卑贱不起眼的工作
<14-6,CASTLE>for a series of menial jobs

495
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,720
<14-6,CASTLE>最后踏入了色情电话的奇妙世界
<14-6,CASTLE>culminating in the wonderful world of phone sex?

496
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,830
<14-6,CASTLE>一点都说不通
<14-6,CASTLE>None of the pieces fit.

497
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,360
<14-7,MARTHA>是谁打电话给她的
<14-7,MARTHA>Hmm. Who called her?

498
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,230
<14-7,MARTHA>我是说  即使没有电话录音
<14-7,MARTHA>I mean, you must be able to trace the call

499
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,130
<14-7,MARTHA>你们肯定也可以追踪这个电话的  不是吗
<14-7,MARTHA>even though you don't have the recording, right?

500
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,130
<14-8,CASTLE>我们已经传讯劳拉当班时
<14-8,CASTLE>Well, we have subpoenaed a list of all the incoming calls

501
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,720
<14-8,CASTLE>所有来电的名单
<14-8,CASTLE>on Laura's shifts,

502
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,620
<14-8,CASTLE>但这好比是海底捞针
<14-8,CASTLE>But that's gonna be like looking for a needle in a needle stack.

503
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,790
<14-9,CASTLE>你好
<14-9,CASTLE>Hello.

504
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,690
<14-10,MYSTERIOUS MAN>卡塞尔先生
<14-10,MYSTERIOUS MAN>Mr. Castle...

<14-10,MYSTERIOUS MAN>还记得我吗
<14-10,MYSTERIOUS MAN>do you remember me?

506
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,440
<14-11,MYSTERIOUS MAN>我们之前通过话
<14-11,MYSTERIOUS MAN>I called you before...

507
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,070
<14-11,MYSTERIOUS MAN>讨论过贝克特探长的安全问题
<14-11,MYSTERIOUS MAN>about Detective Beckett's safety.

508
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,600
<14-12,CASTLE>我记得
<14-12,CASTLE>I remember.

509
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,740
<14-13,MYSTERIOUS MAN>这一次  卡塞尔先生
<14-13,MYSTERIOUS MAN>Once again, Mr. Castle,

510
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,180
<14-13,MYSTERIOUS MAN>看来我们又要好好谈谈了
<14-13,MYSTERIOUS MAN>it seems that we need to talk.

511
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,360
<15-1,MARTHA>你确定这就是上次为了
<15-1,MARTHA>Are you sure it's the same man

512
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,630
<15-1,MARTHA>贝克特的事打电话来的人
<15-1,MARTHA>who called you about Beckett?

513
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,780
<15-2,CASTLE>肯定是他
<15-2,CASTLE>It's definitely him.

514
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,250
<15-3,MARTHA>这么说这个年轻女子的死与
<15-3,MARTHA>Then the death of this young woman

515
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,110
<15-3,MARTHA>贝克特母亲之间有着什么联系
<15-3,MARTHA>is somehow connected to Beckett's mother?

516
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,780
<15-4,CASTLE>肯定是  要不然他为什么打电话过来
<15-4,CASTLE>It has to be, otherwise why would he call?

517
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,670
<15-5,MARTHA>他说了什么
<15-5,MARTHA>What did he say?

518
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,800
<15-6,CASTLE>他说还有更强大的力量卷入其中
<15-6,CASTLE>He said that there were greater forces at play,

519
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,970
<15-6,CASTLE>其中的利害关系比我们想的更深
<15-6,CASTLE>that more was at stake than we realize.

520
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,710
<15-6,CASTLE>这一切显然不仅仅关乎色情电话了
<15-6,CASTLE>Clearly this is not just about phone sex.

521
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,460
<15-6,CASTLE>不管那天晚上劳拉·坎布里奇无意中听到了什么
<15-6,CASTLE>Whatever Laura Cambridge overheard that night,

522
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,360
<15-6,CASTLE>肯定引起了某人的注意  某个大人物
<15-6,CASTLE>It got someone's attention, someone big.

523
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,640
<15-7,MARTHA>我不懂的是  他要你对此做些什么
<15-7,MARTHA>What I don't get is, what are you supposed to do about it?

524
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,370
<15-7,MARTHA>我不知道
<15-7,MARTHA>I don't know.

525
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,340
<15-8,CASTLE>他给了我一个号码
<15-8,CASTLE>He gave me a number

526
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,060
<15-8,CASTLE>让我在需要帮助的时候联系他
<15-8,CASTLE>to contact him if I needed help.

527
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,660
<15-8,CASTLE>他说我会知道是什么时候的
<15-8,CASTLE>He said I would know when it was time.

528
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,710
<15-9,MARTHA>你打算告诉贝克特吗
<15-9,MARTHA>You plan to tell Beckett?

529
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,410
<15-10,CASTLE>告诉她什么  嘿  凯特
<15-10,CASTLE>Tell her what? "Hey, Kate.

<15-10,CASTLE>I've been taking calls from a shadowy figure

531
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,100
<15-10,CASTLE>他想让我阻止你继续调查你母亲的谋杀案
<15-10,CASTLE>who wants to keep you off your mother's murder case

532
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,790
<15-10,CASTLE>以免你也遭遇不测
<15-10,CASTLE>so they don't kill you, too"?

533
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,170
<15-10,CASTLE>恩  好的
<15-10,CASTLE>Yeah. Okay.

534
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,010
<16-1,BECKETT>稍等一下
<16-1,BECKETT>Hold on. Wait.

535
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,920
<16-1,BECKETT>你说什么
<16-1,BECKETT>What did you say?

536
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,610
<16-2,BECKETT>不  我没在吃东西
<16-2,BECKETT>No, I'm not eating.

537
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,300
<16-2,BECKETT>谢谢

<16-3,BECKETT>Hey. You're just in time.

539
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,810
<16-3,BECKETT>谢谢你
<16-3,BECKETT>Thank you.

540
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,360
<16-4,BECKETT>出什么事了吗
<16-4,BECKETT>What's wrong?

541
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,670
<16-5,CASTLE>没事
<16-5,CASTLE>Nothing.

542
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,740
<16-6,CASTLE>都查到了什么
<16-6,CASTLE>So what have we got?

543
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,200
<16-7,BECKETT>蕾妮刚打电话了
<16-7,BECKETT>Lanie just called.

544
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,130
<16-7,BECKETT>她说她在死者嘴里和食道中
<16-7,BECKETT>She said that she found fibers in Laura's mouth

545
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,260
<16-7,BECKETT>发现了一些纤维
<16-7,BECKETT>and esophagus.

546
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,180
<16-7,BECKETT>实验室确认为浅棕色羊绒
<16-7,BECKETT>The lab I.D.'ed it as light brown cashmere,

547
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,990
<16-7,BECKETT>极有可能来自凶手外衣的袖子
<16-7,BECKETT>which was most likely from our killer's coat sleeve.

548
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,150
<16-7,BECKETT>棕色羊绒
<16-7,BECKETT>Brown cashmere.

549
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,410
<16-8,CASTLE>那我们可以将嫌疑犯范围
<16-8,CASTLE>So we can narrow our suspects down

550
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,440
<16-8,CASTLE>缩小到为高品味的有钱人
<16-8,CASTLE>to rich men with impeccable taste.

551
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,700
<16-9,BECKETT>你是说你自己也有嫌疑了
<16-9,BECKETT>Are you saying, you're a suspect?

552
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,380
<16-10,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯是我的不在场证明
<16-10,CASTLE>Alexis is my alibi.

553
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,900
<16-10,CASTLE>那个煤气公司员工怎么样了
<16-10,CASTLE>What about our gas company worker?

554
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,650
<16-11,BECKETT>想不到吧  他并不在煤气公司工作
<16-11,BECKETT>Well, surprise--he doesn't work for the gas company.

555
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,140
<16-11,BECKETT>警员说在致电性感女神办公室里
<16-11,BECKETT>And uniforms said that there was no forensic evidence

556
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,460
<16-11,BECKETT>也没找到任何法鉴证据
<16-11,BECKETT>at the dial-a-goddess office.

557
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,340
<16-12,RYAN>但我们从致电性感女神拿到了
<16-12,RYAN>But what we did get from dial-a-goddess were

558
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,320
<16-12,RYAN>他们冗长的电话记录  大概两百多页
<16-12,RYAN>their copious call logs-- about 200 pages worth.

559
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,820
<16-12,RYAN>这些女士们非常忙碌
<16-12,RYAN>These ladies are busy.

560
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,050
<16-12,RYAN>我整个早上都花在这上面了
<16-12,RYAN>I've been going through them all morning,

561
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,250
<16-12,RYAN>试图把劳拉的电话从里面整理出来
<16-12,RYAN>trying to sort Laura's calls from the other girls' lines.

562
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,110
<16-13,CASTLE>里面有从市长办公室里打出的吗
<16-13,CASTLE>Are there any calls in there from the mayor's office?

563
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,130
<16-14,BECKETT>我以为你十分确信
<16-14,BECKETT>I thought you said you were confident

564
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,130
<16-14,BECKETT>他与此事无关呢
<16-14,BECKETT>that he wasn't involved?

565
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,040
<16-15,CASTLE>我只是想更彻底和公正一点
<16-15,CASTLE>I'm just trying to be thorough and impartial.

566
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,780
<16-15,CASTLE>还没发现
<16-15,CASTLE>Not yet,

567
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,140
<16-16,RYAN>但政府部门的不在少数
<16-16,RYAN>but the private sector is well-represented.

568
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,780
<16-16,RYAN>这里有警察局的  银行的
<16-16,RYAN>I got calls from the met, banks,

569
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,190
<16-16,RYAN>还有一些有名的证券公司的
<16-16,RYAN>several high-profile brokerage houses.

570
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,630
<16-16,RYAN>怪不得会经济危机了  是吧
<16-16,RYAN>No wonder the economy collapsed, huh?

571
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,920
<16-17,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<16-17,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

572
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,720
<16-18,BECKETT>失陪
<16-18,BECKETT>Excuse me.

573
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,670
<16-18,BECKETT>你查到什么了
<16-18,BECKETT>What do you got?

574
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,470
<16-19,CASTLE>如果这里出现任何
<16-19,CASTLE>If anything shows up in here

575
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,190
<16-19,CASTLE>与贝克特枪击案
<16-19,CASTLE>and it's tied to

576
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,700
<16-19,CASTLE>或乔安娜·贝克特凶杀案有关的东西
<16-19,CASTLE>either Beckett's shooting or Johanna Beckett's murder,

577
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,530
<16-19,CASTLE>你能马上通知我吗
<16-19,CASTLE>would you tell me right away?

578
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,900
<16-20,RYAN>等等  你们认为这和
<16-20,RYAN>Wait. You guys think this is connected--

579
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,750
<16-20,RYAN>不
<16-20,RYAN>No.

580
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,430
<16-21,CASTLE>不是我们
<16-21,CASTLE>Not you guys.

581
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,420
<16-21,CASTLE>贝克特不知情  而且我不想让她知道
<16-21,CASTLE>Beckett doesn't know, and I don't want her to know.

582
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,650
<16-22,RYAN>你为什么认为两者有联系
<16-22,RYAN>Why do you think it's connected?

583
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,490
<16-23,CASTLE>我只是
<16-23,CASTLE>I just...

584
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,160
<16-23,CASTLE>我只是想考虑所有的可能性
<16-23,CASTLE>I just want to cover all my bases.

585
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,320
<16-24,RYAN>-好吗  -好的
<16-24,RYAN>- Okay?  - Okay.

586
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,430
<16-25,CASTLE>-谢谢了  -伙计们
<16-25,CASTLE>- Thanks.  - You guys.

587
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,110
<16-26,BECKETT>警员在劳拉公寓周围排查的时候
<16-26,BECKETT>So uniforms canvassing around Laura's apartment

588
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,030
<16-26,BECKETT>找到了一名出租车司机认出了她
<16-26,BECKETT>found a cab that recognized her pic.

589
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,150
<16-26,BECKETT>他说两天前他送她到
<16-26,BECKETT>He said that two days ago, he dropped her off

590
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,450
<16-26,BECKETT>市里的哥谭11频道电视台
<16-26,BECKETT>at the Gotham 11 TV station downtown.

591
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,880
<16-27,CASTLE>电视台
<16-27,CASTLE>A television station.

592
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,620
<16-28,CASTLE>她为什么去电视台
<16-28,CASTLE>Why would she go to a television station?

593
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,280
<16-29,RYAN>她为什么进入色情电话行业
<16-29,RYAN>Why would she go into the phone sex business?

594
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,780
<16-29,RYAN>她为什么做所有的这些事情
<16-29,RYAN>Why would she do any of these things she did?

595
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,630
<16-30,ESPOSITO>希望我们能找到答案  但首先
<16-30,ESPOSITO>Well, hopefully I'll get some answers, but first,

596
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,880
<16-30,ESPOSITO>我追查了埃德加·纳瓦罗给我们的那个手机号
<16-30,ESPOSITO>I ran down that cell number we got from Edgar Navarro.

597
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,330
<16-30,ESPOSITO>是部预付费手机
<16-30,ESPOSITO>It's a pay-as-you-go phone.

598
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,260
<16-30,ESPOSITO>劳拉六天前才开始用
<16-30,ESPOSITO>Laura just activated it six days ago.

599
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,450
<16-30,ESPOSITO>她基本没怎么用过
<16-30,ESPOSITO>She's hardly used it.

600
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,090
<16-30,ESPOSITO>她打了个电话给埃德加
<16-30,ESPOSITO>She made one call to Edgar

601
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,130
<16-30,ESPOSITO>她在遇害那天打给了一个代理商[探员]
<16-30,ESPOSITO>and another on the day she died to an agent.

602
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,430
<16-31,CASTLE>联邦探员吗
<16-31,CASTLE>A federal agent?

603
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,550
<16-32,ESPOSITO>不  一个出版商  特雷弗·海因斯
<16-32,ESPOSITO>No, a book agent. Trevor Hanes.

604
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,710
<17-1,TREVOR HANES>实在是太不幸了
<17-1,TREVOR HANES>It's just absurdly tragic.

605
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,140
<17-1,TREVOR HANES>劳拉是一位才华横溢的作家
<17-1,TREVOR HANES>Laura was an incredibly talented writer.

606
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,630
<17-2,CASTLE>你是她的出版商
<17-2,CASTLE>You were her agent?

607
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,820
<17-3,HANES>是的  我们是六个月与她签约的
<17-3,HANES>Yeah, we signed her as a client about six months ago

608
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,000
<17-3,HANES>因为她提出了一个很精彩的点子
<17-3,HANES>on the back of an astonishing book proposal.

609
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,850
<17-4,BECKETT>这本书讲的是什么
<17-4,BECKETT>What's the book about?

610
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,220
<17-5,HANES>是关于从穷苦大众的角度
<17-5,HANES>It's a scathing indictment of societal inequity

611
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,250
<17-5,HANES>对社会的不平等进行严厉的控诉
<17-5,HANES>as seen through the lens of the working poor.

612
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,800
<17-5,HANES>呈现了当今社会
<17-5,HANES>A sort of contemporary take

613
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
<17-5,HANES>底层人们生活困境
<17-5,HANES>on how the other half lives.

614
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,100
<17-5,HANES>一位养尊处优的女性放弃一切
<17-5,HANES>A privileged young woman gives up every comfort

615
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,660
<17-5,HANES>去体验贫困人群的生活
<17-5,HANES>to experience life below the poverty line.

616
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,030
<17-6,CASTLE>所以她才会做那些工作  第一手资料
<17-6,CASTLE>That's why she took all those jobs--firsthand research.

617
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,890
<17-7,HANES>这种题材十分卖座
<17-7,HANES>The thing pitches itself really.

618
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,210
<17-8,BECKETT>我们需要看一下她的手稿
<17-8,BECKETT>So we'll need to see a copy of that manuscript.

619
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,120
<17-8,BECKETT>她的调查可能导致了她被害
<17-8,BECKETT>Her investigations might have led to her death.

620
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,700
<17-9,HANES>她没有手稿  至少我没看到过
<17-9,HANES>Well, there isn't one, at least not that I've seen anyway.

621
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,470
<17-9,HANES>而且我不认为她是因为
<17-9,HANES>Bedsides... I don't think she was killed

622
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,250
<17-9,HANES>反资本主义言论而遇害的
<17-9,HANES>because of her anticapitalist polemic.

623
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,310
<17-10,BECKETT>你是什么意思
<17-10,BECKETT>What do you mean?

624
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,100
<17-11,HANES>这周早些时候  她打电话到我办公室
<17-11,HANES>Earlier this week, she called my office,

625
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,080
<17-11,HANES>说她发现了一个更为惊人的故事
<17-11,HANES>said she stumbled upon a much more explosive story--

626
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,420
<17-11,HANES>是一桩丑闻  牵扯到一位十分显赫
<17-11,HANES>a scandal involving a very prominent,

627
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,740
<17-11,HANES>在纽约举足轻重的人物
<17-11,HANES>very powerful New Yorker.

628
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,000
<17-11,HANES>她说这会彻底地震动这座城市
<17-11,HANES>She said it would rock the city to its very foundations.

629
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,820
<17-12,CASTLE>哪个纽约的大人物
<17-12,CASTLE>W-what--what prominent New Yorker?

630
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,610
<17-12,CASTLE>她不肯说
<17-12,CASTLE>She wouldn't say.

631
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,070
<17-13,HANES>我以为她只是想跟我再签本书
<17-13,HANES>I just assumed it was a pitch for her next book.

632
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,770
<17-13,HANES>我们约好这个礼拜讨论的
<17-13,HANES>We were gonna discuss it this week.

633
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,460
<17-14,BECKETT>对不起  失陪一下
<17-14,BECKETT>Sorry. Excuse me.

634
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,370
<17-15,BECKETT>埃斯波
<17-15,BECKETT>Hey, Espo.

<17-16,ESPOSITO>There's something you need to see.

637
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,800
<18-1,ESPOSITO>这位是帕特·麦康诺  劳拉的大学同学
<18-1,ESPOSITO>This is Pat McConnell, Laura's college buddy.

638
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
<18-1,ESPOSITO>把你和我说的复述一遍
<18-1,ESPOSITO>Tell 'em what you told me.

639
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,760
<18-2,PAT>我很多年没见过劳拉了
<18-2,PAT>Well, I hadn't seen Laura in years.

640
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,670
<18-2,PAT>几天前她突然打电话给我
<18-2,PAT>So a few days ago, she calls me out of the blue,

641
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,730
<18-2,PAT>说是要看看我们拍的一些原始录像
<18-2,PAT>says she needs to see some raw footage we shot

642
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,840
<18-2,PAT>说是她的研究项目需要
<18-2,PAT>for this research project she's working on.

643
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,330
<18-2,PAT>所以我带她来了这个编辑室
<18-2,PAT>So I set her up at this edit bay.

644
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,800
<18-2,PAT>她一待就是八个小时
<18-2,PAT>She was here for over eight hours.

645
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,920
<18-2,PAT>有段时间她都睡着了
<18-2,PAT>I mean, at one point, she even fell asleep.

646
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,000
<18-2,PAT>我当时过来看过她  发现她眼睛闭着
<18-2,PAT>I came by to check on her, she had her eyes closed.

647
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,990
<18-3,BECKETT>-什么原始录像  -都是副带
<18-3,BECKETT>- Raw footage of what? - It's all b-roll

648

654

<18-7,CASTLE>去年我参加了他们的庆功会
<18-7,CASTLE>I went to their gala last year.

655
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,000
<18-8,ESPOSITO>你看屏幕边上的这个女人
<18-8,ESPOSITO>Now look at the girl on the side of the screen.

656
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,320
<18-9,BECKETT>是劳拉
<18-9,BECKETT>That's Laura.

657
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,680
<18-10,CASTLE>这不可能  他说他不认识她
<18-10,CASTLE>That's impossible. He said he didn't know her.

658
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,240
<18-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看市长的穿着
<18-11,BECKETT>Castle, look what the mayor is wearing.

659
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
<18-11,BECKETT>浅棕色外套  像羊毛材质的
<18-11,BECKETT>It's a light brown coat, and it looks like cashmere.

660
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,940
<18-11,BECKETT>和凶手的衣着一样
<18-11,BECKETT>That's just the coat that our killer was wearing.

661
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,840
<19-1,CASTLE>贝克特  我了解这个人
<19-1,CASTLE>Beckett, I know this man.

662
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,150
<19-1,CASTLE>我们认识十二年了  他不是杀人犯
<19-1,CASTLE>I've known him 12 years. He's not a killer.

663
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,290
<19-2,BECKETT>这点你不知道
<19-2,BECKETT>You don't know that.

664
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,600
<19-3,CASTLE>我敢肯定
<19-3,CASTLE>Yes, I do.

665
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,110
<19-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他对我们撒谎说他不认识死者
<19-4,BECKETT>Castle, he lied about knowing our victim.

666
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,730
<19-5,CASTLE>他当时站在她旁边
<19-5,CASTLE>He was standing next to her.

667
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,270
<19-5,CASTLE>这不代表他认识她
<19-5,CASTLE>That doesn't mean he knew her.

668
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,200
<19-5,CASTLE>你知道他一天之内要见多少人吗
<19-5,CASTLE>You know how many people he meets in a day?

669
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,980
<19-5,CASTLE>你想要他记住每个人
<19-5,CASTLE>Expecting him to remember them all--

670
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,360
<19-5,CASTLE>就像想要我记住
<19-5,CASTLE>that's like expecting me to remember

671
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,700
<19-5,CASTLE>每个来我签售会的人一样
<19-5,CASTLE>everyone who comes to my book signings.

672
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,550
<19-6,BECKETT>你偏袒他
<19-6,BECKETT>You're biased.

673
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,870
<19-7,CASTLE>你说得太对了  我就是偏袒他
<19-7,CASTLE>You're damn right, I'm biased.

674
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,590
<19-7,CASTLE>罗伯特·威尔顿是个好人
<19-7,CASTLE>Robert Weldon is a good man.

675
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,020
<19-8,BECKETT>好人也会失足犯错  他可以支配那辆车
<19-8,BECKETT>Even good men make mistakes. He had access to that car.

676
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:56,220
<19-8,BECKETT>他的助手说他离开聚会的时间是晚上九点
<19-8,BECKETT>His aide said that he left the event at 9:00 p.m.

677
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,520
<19-8,BECKETT>就在谋杀时间区之内
<19-8,BECKETT>That's right inside of our kill zone.

678
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,430
<19-9,CASTLE>好吧  那他有何动机
<19-9,CASTLE>Fine. What's his motive?

679
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,210
<19-10,BECKETT>我不知道  至少现在还不知道
<19-10,BECKETT>I don't know, at least, not yet.

680
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,380
<19-11,CASTLE>那就给他个机会
<19-11,CASTLE>Then give him a chance,

681
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,670
<19-11,CASTLE>因为一旦你对他采取行动
<19-11,CASTLE>because the minute you move on him,

682
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,930
<19-11,CASTLE>他的事业就毁于一旦了
<19-11,CASTLE>his career is over.

683
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,260
<19-12,GATES>有什么新消息
<19-12,GATES>So... what's the latest?

684
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,360
<19-13,BECKETT>我们查到几条不错的线索
<19-13,BECKETT>We've got a couple of promising leads.

685
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,050
<19-13,BECKETT>我希望能尽快找到确凿的证据
<19-13,BECKETT>I'm hoping to find something concrete soon.

686
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,670
<19-14,GATES>对死者的调查有更多发现吗
<19-14,GATES>Well, anything more on the victim?

687
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,020
<19-14,GATES>能把她和市政厅联系起来吗
<19-14,GATES>Anything connecting her back to City Hall?

688
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,430
<19-15,BECKETT>还没有
<19-15,BECKETT>No, not yet.

689
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,000
<19-16,GATES>好吧  探长
<19-16,GATES>All right, detective.

690
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,170
<19-16,GATES>有任何消息  及时通知我
<19-16,GATES>Anything pops, you let me know.

691
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,830
<19-17,BECKETT>真好  这下我成骗子了
<19-17,BECKETT>Great. Now I'm a liar.

692
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,540
<19-18,CASTLE>知道我怎么想吗
<19-18,CASTLE>You know what I think?

693
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,400
<19-18,CASTLE>我认为她希望凶手是他
<19-18,CASTLE>I think she's hoping it's him,

694
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,160
<19-18,CASTLE>因为只要他下台走人  我也就跟着滚蛋了
<19-18,CASTLE>because if he's gone, I'm gone.

695
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,920
<19-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能把这当做是针对你
<19-19,BECKETT>Castle, you can't make this one about you.

696
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,370
<19-20,CASTLE>你去哪
<19-20,CASTLE>Where are you going?

697
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,590
<19-21,BECKETT>你说的对  我们必须知道威尔顿的动机
<19-21,BECKETT>You're right. We have to figure out Weldon's motive.

698
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,030
<19-21,BECKETT>没有动机  盖茨不会让我
<19-21,BECKETT>There's no way that Gates is gonna let me

699
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,540
<19-21,BECKETT>传唤大衣做证物的
<19-21,BECKETT>subpoena that coat without it.

700
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,260
<19-22,CASTLE>真的吗  你要这么做
<19-22,CASTLE>Really, that's your takeaway?

701
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,700
<19-23,BECKETT>你打算让我怎么办  卡塞尔
<19-23,BECKETT>What do you want me to do, Castle?

702
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,690
<19-23,BECKETT>我知道他是你朋友
<19-23,BECKETT>I know that he's your friend,

703
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,570
<19-23,BECKETT>但如果他真的杀了那个姑娘  那么抱歉
<19-23,BECKETT>but I'm sorry, if he killed that girl--

704
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,280
<19-25,BECKETT>-他没有  -那就让我证实
<19-25,BECKETT>- He didn't. - Then let me prove it.

705
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,680
<19-26,BECKETT>莱恩
<19-26,BECKETT>Ryan?

706
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,750
<19-27,RYAN>好的  感谢你的帮助
<19-27,RYAN>All right. Thanks for your help.

707
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,440
<19-28,BECKETT>录像查出线索了吗
<19-28,BECKETT>Anything else on that video?

708
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,760
<19-29,RYAN>还真有
<19-29,RYAN>Actually, yeah.

709
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,010
<19-29,RYAN>我们第一次瞧见劳拉时  她戴着
<19-29,RYAN>When we first saw Laura, she was wearing a volunteer badge

710
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,390
<19-29,RYAN>移动图书馆基金会的志愿者徽章
<19-29,RYAN>for the reading train foundation.

711
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,590
<19-30,RYAN>她是市长那个慈善机构的工作人员
<19-30,RYAN>She was on staff at the mayor's charity.

712
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,700
<19-31,CASTLE>这不能代表他认识她
<19-31,CASTLE>That doesn't mean he knew her.

713
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,080
<19-32,BECKETT>莱恩  你跟我来
<19-32,BECKETT>Ryan, you're with me.

714
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,240
<19-32,BECKETT>卡塞尔  抱歉  你无法客观办案
<19-32,BECKETT>Castle, I'm sorry, but you can't be objective on this one,

715
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,960
<19-32,BECKETT>这案子我得自己查了
<19-32,BECKETT>so I'm gonna have to pursue it on my own.

716
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,550
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>我不知道威尔顿市长
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>No, uh, I don't know if Mayor Weldon

717
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,130
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>是否认识劳拉·坎布里奇
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>and Laura Cambridge were acquainted.

718
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,480
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>我不怎么了解她
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>I don't know much about her at all.

719
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,750
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>她在这儿没干多久
<20-1,CONNIE PARK>She wasn't here very long.

720
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,820
<5-26,BECKETT>你什么意思
<5-26,BECKETT>What do you mean?

721
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,110
<20-2,BECKETT>我们大约一周前雇劳拉来当志愿者
<20-2,BECKETT>Well, we hired Laura as a volunteer about a week ago.

722
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,120
<20-3,CONNIE>几天以后我们就不得不解雇了她
<20-3,CONNIE>A few days later, we had to fire her.

723
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,080
<20-4,BECKETT>为什么
<20-4,BECKETT>Why?

724
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,920
<20-5,CONNIE>我们发现她拷贝机密文件
<20-5,CONNIE>She was caught copying confidential files.

725
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,390
<20-6,RYAN>-什么文件  -财务数据
<20-6,RYAN>- What kind of files? - Accounting files.

726
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,910
<20-8,BECKETT>知道她为何对那些资料感兴趣吗
<20-8,BECKETT>Any idea why she would be interested in those files?

727
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,550
<20-9,BECKETT>-帕克女士  -这是敏感话题
<20-9,BECKETT>- Ms. Park? - It's sensitive.

728
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,090
<20-10,CONNIE>我不该谈论此事
<20-10,CONNIE>I'm not supposed to talk about it.

729
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,950
<20-11,BECKETT>帕克女士  一名女子被害了
<20-11,BECKETT>Ms. Park, a woman was murdered,

730
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,530
<20-11,BECKETT>我们在找寻原因
<20-11,BECKETT>and we are trying to figure out why.

731
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,220
<20-11,BECKETT>你可以在这里和我们交代
<20-11,BECKETT>You can talk to us here,

732
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,420
<20-11,BECKETT>也可以跟我们回局里
<20-11,BECKETT>or we can go downtown.

733
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,990
<20-12,CONNIE>我们最近发现财务账目有问题
<20-12,CONNIE>We've recently discovered some discrepancies in our accounts.

734
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
<20-12,CONNIE>-有资金遗失了  -多少资金

<20-14,CONNIE>There's an internal investigation going on.

737
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,150
<20-15,BECKETT>这个调查
<20-15,BECKETT>This investigation,

738
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,210
<20-15,BECKETT>和威尔顿市长有关系吗
<20-15,BECKETT>does it have anything to do with mayor weldon?

739
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,640
<20-15,BECKETT>谢谢
<20-15,BECKETT>Thank you.

740
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,560
<21-1,RYAN>检察长办公室确认
<21-1,RYAN>Attorney General's office confirms

741
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,800
<21-1,RYAN>威尔顿市长是调查的嫌疑人
<21-1,RYAN>that Mayor Weldon is the subject of the investigation.

742
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,830
<21-2,ESPOSITO>这不就是我们在找的动机吗
<21-2,ESPOSITO>We were looking for motive, and here it is--

743
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,190
<21-2,ESPOSITO>价值两百三十万美元
<21-2,ESPOSITO>$2.3 million worth.

744
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,440
<21-3,BECKETT>威尔顿从自己的慈善机构里私挪资金
<21-3,BECKETT>Weldon embezzled from his own charity.

745
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,080
<21-3,BECKETT>肯定是有人在与劳拉通话时
<21-3,BECKETT>Someone must have told Laura about it

746
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,100
<21-3,BECKETT>把这事告诉了她
<21-3,BECKETT>during one of her sessions,

747
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,700
<21-3,BECKETT>然后她决定深入调查
<21-3,BECKETT>and she decided to investigate.

748
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,010
<21-4,RYAN>她找到了足够证据让市长翻船
<21-4,RYAN>When she found enough evidence to expose the mayor,

749
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,180
<21-4,RYAN>所以他杀人灭口
<21-4,RYAN>he killed her to shut her up.

750
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
<21-5,ESPOSITO>你打算告诉她吗
<21-5,ESPOSITO>You gonna tell her?

751
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,120
<21-6,BECKETT>必须告诉她
<21-6,BECKETT>I have to.

752
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,860
<21-7,RYAN>这事会毁了威尔顿
<21-7,RYAN>This will destroy Weldon, you know?

753
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,840
<21-8,BECKETT>我知道
<21-8,BECKETT>Yeah, I know.

754
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,680
<21-9,ESPOSITO>等他下了台  她第一件事就是
<21-9,ESPOSITO>And when he's gone, the first thing she'll do

755
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:06,790
<21-9,ESPOSITO>让卡塞尔走人
<21-9,ESPOSITO>is get rid of Castle.

756
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,790
<21-10,BECKETT>我知道
<21-10,BECKETT>I know.

757
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,410
<22-1,GATES>你确定吗
<22-1,GATES>Are you sure about this?

758
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,270
<22-2,BECKETT>是的  长官  但一旦我
<22-2,BECKETT>Yes, sir, but the moment

759
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,730
<22-2,BECKETT>申请搜查证去获取他的大衣
<22-2,BECKETT>I file a warrant request for that coat,

760
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,170
<22-2,BECKETT>就会留下公共记录
<22-2,BECKETT>it becomes public record.

761
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,150
<22-3,GATES>那又如何
<22-3,GATES>So?

762
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,660
<22-4,BECKETT>到那时每个人都会知道
<22-4,BECKETT>So then everyone will know

763
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,600
<22-4,BECKETT>威尔顿市长是我们的嫌犯
<22-4,BECKETT>that Mayor Weldon is a person of interest.

764
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,010
<22-5,GATES>他不是吗
<22-5,GATES>Isn't he?

765
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,750
<22-6,BECKETT>他是  但是...
<22-6,BECKETT>Yes, but...

766
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
<22-6,BECKETT>如果我错了呢
<22-6,BECKETT>What if I'm wrong?

767
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,720
<22-6,BECKETT>这会毁了他的前程
<22-6,BECKETT>It could ruin his career.

768
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,700
<22-7,GATES>纽约市委我们以重任  去保护市民
<22-7,GATES>We... are tasked by the city of New York to protect its people.

769
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,540
<22-7,GATES>有时候要为这份责任付出代价
<22-7,GATES>Sometimes that task comes with a cost.

770
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,170
<22-7,GATES>我知道自己的绰号是什么  探长
<22-7,GATES>I know what they call me, detective--

771
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,580
<22-7,GATES>"铁娘子盖茨"
<22-7,GATES>"Iron Gates."

772
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,290
<22-7,GATES>我也会听到流言
<22-7,GATES>I hear the whispers.

773
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,160
<22-7,GATES>"她是从内务处来的  她一定恨透了警察"
<22-7,GATES>"She's from I.A. She must hate cops."

774
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,890
<22-7,GATES>事实是
<22-7,GATES>Well, the truth is,

775
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,770
<22-7,GATES>我爱警察
<22-7,GATES>I love cops.

776
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,270
<22-7,GATES>我老爸是名警察
<22-7,GATES>My daddy was a cop.

777
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,040
<22-7,GATES>叔叔们也都是
<22-7,GATES>My uncles were cops.

778
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,220
<22-7,GATES>但是袭击了我做巡警时的搭档的
<22-7,GATES>But the sergeant who assaulted my patrol partner

779
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,550
<22-7,GATES>那个位高权重的警长
<22-7,GATES>under the collar or authority...

780
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,120
<22-7,GATES>又有谁能将他绳之以法呢
<22-7,GATES>Who holds him accountable?

781
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,640
<22-7,GATES>也是我们
<22-7,GATES>We do.

782
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,250
<22-7,GATES>去找市长
<22-7,GATES>Go to the mayor,

783
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,990
<22-7,GATES>叫他自愿把外套交出来
<22-7,GATES>get him to voluntarily surrender his coat

784
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,720
<22-7,GATES>做纤维测试  省去搜查证
<22-7,GATES>for fiber testing without a warrant.

785
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,460
<22-7,GATES>告诉他这是避开媒体的唯一方式
<22-7,GATES>Tell him it's the only way to keep it out of the media.

786
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,210
<23-7,CASTLE>如果他拒绝
<23-7,CASTLE>But if he refuses,

787
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,890
<22-7,GATES>你去申请搜查证
<22-7,GATES>you get that warrant

788
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,290
<22-7,GATES>尽到你的职责
<22-7,GATES>and you do your job,

789
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,200
<22-7,GATES>无论代价多高
<22-7,GATES>whatever the cost.

790
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,660
<23-1,CASTLE>你要去见威尔顿吗
<23-1,CASTLE>You going to see Weldon?

791
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,010
<23-2,BECKETT>是的
<23-2,BECKETT>Yes.

792
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,900
<23-3,CASTLE>我要跟你一起去  我觉得我能帮上忙
<23-3,CASTLE>I'd like to come with you. I think I can help.

793
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,080
<23-4,BECKETT>我不认为你能
<23-4,BECKETT>I don't think you can.

794
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,240
<23-5,CASTLE>你的话我都听进去了
<23-5,CASTLE>Look, I heard what you said.

795
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,530
<23-5,CASTLE>真的
<23-5,CASTLE>I did.

796
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,480
<23-5,CASTLE>我想我会很有帮助
<23-5,CASTLE>And I think I can be a valuable asset.

797
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,970
<23-5,CASTLE>我跟他一起玩牌  知道他何时是虚张声势
<23-5,CASTLE>I play poker with the guy. I can tell when he's bluffing.

798
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,370
<23-6,BECKETT>那如果我要强行请他配合呢
<23-6,BECKETT>And what about if I have to force his hand,

799
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,520
<23-6,BECKETT>你还会帮着我吗
<23-6,BECKETT>can you be an asset then?

800
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,080
<23-7,CASTLE>我认为不是他干的
<23-7,CASTLE>Look, I don't think he did it.

801
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,220
<23-7,CASTLE>但若真是他  我想知道
<23-7,CASTLE>But if he did, I want to know.

802
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,500
<23-7,CASTLE>这样说来  我就是客观的
<23-7,CASTLE>That makes me objective.

803
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,640
<24-1,BRIAN SHAY>你不需跟他们谈话  这是我的职责
<24-1,BRIAN SHAY>Sir, you don't have to talk to them. It's--it's my job.

804
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,490
<24-2,WELDON>没关系  布莱恩  我不需要你来保护我
<24-2,WELDON>It's okay, Brian. I don't need you to protect me.

805
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,220
<24-3,SHAY>-市长  -我没做任何亏心事
<24-3,SHAY>- Sir... - I haven't done anything wrong.

806
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,230
<24-4,WELDON>就这样吧
<24-4,WELDON>Please.

807
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,300
<24-4,WELDON>谢谢
<24-4,WELDON>Thank you.

808
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,000
<24-5,BECKETT>谢谢
<24-5,BECKETT>Thank you.

809
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,640
<24-5,BECKETT>市长大人  谢谢你愿与我们谈谈
<24-5,BECKETT>Your Honor, I appreciate you speaking with us.

810
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,590
<24-6,WELDON>似乎我也没别的选择啊
<24-6,WELDON>Well, it sounded like I didn't have a choice.

811
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,300
<24-7,BECKETT>上次谈话时
<24-7,BECKETT>Well, the last time we spoke,

812
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,470
<24-7,BECKETT>你说你不认识劳拉·坎布里奇
<24-7,BECKETT>you said you that you didn't know Laura Cambridge.

813
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,190
<24-8,WELDON>是的
<24-8,WELDON>That's right.

814
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,470
<24-9,BECKETT>但照片中  你就站在劳拉旁边
<24-9,BECKETT>And yet here you are standing next to Laura--

815
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,370
<24-9,BECKETT>她是移动图书馆的志愿者
<24-9,BECKETT>a volunteer at reading train.

816
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,000
<24-10,WELDON>我之前确实没认出她
<24-10,WELDON>I-I didn't recognize her,

817
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,820
<24-10,WELDON>但你这么说  我想起来了
<24-10,WELDON>but in context, I-I remember her.

818
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,890
<24-10,WELDON>这次活动是几天前
<24-10,WELDON>This event was a few nights ago.

819
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,350
<24-10,WELDON>她想跟我谈谈  但...
<24-10,WELDON>She was trying to talk to me, but--

820
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,760
<24-11,BECKETT>她跟你说过话吗
<24-11,BECKETT>Did she talk to you?

821
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,680
<24-12,WELDON>没有  我被人拉走了
<24-12,WELDON>No, I got pulled away.

822
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,900
<24-12,WELDON>我要和捐款人聊天
<24-12,WELDON>I had donors I had to speak with.

823
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,610
<24-12,WELDON>我记得她说  她想跟我谈谈
<24-12,WELDON>I remember her saying that she wanted to talk to me,

824
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,120
<24-12,WELDON>但当时情况不允许
<24-12,WELDON>but circumstances prevented it.

825
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,130
<24-13,CASTLE>你和劳拉并未说过话
<24-13,CASTLE>So you and Laura never actually spoke?

826
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,670
<24-15,BECKETT>-没有  -在电话上也没有吗
<24-15,BECKETT>- No. - Not even on the phone?

827
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,510
<24-16,WELDON>没有  说实话  那晚过后
<24-16,WELDON>No, honestly, after that night,

828
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,450
<24-16,WELDON>我再没想起过她
<24-16,WELDON>I never gave her a second thought.

829
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,680
<24-17,BECKETT>在这张照片中
<24-17,BECKETT>You know, in this photo,

830
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,960
<24-17,BECKETT>你穿着一件浅棕色的羊绒大衣
<24-17,BECKETT>you're wearing a light brown cashmere coat.

831
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,490
<24-18,BECKETT>希望你能交给鉴证组做检测
<24-18,BECKETT>We'd like you to turn it over to C.S.U. for testing.

832
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,460
<24-19,WELDON>很抱歉  我不能交给你
<24-19,WELDON>Respectfully, I'm going to have to decline.

833
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,130
<24-20,BECKETT>-为什么  -罗伯特
<24-20,BECKETT>- Why? - Robert...

834
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,620
<24-21,CASTLE>把大衣给她  对你只有好处
<24-21,CASTLE>Give her the coat. It can only be good for you.

835
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,270
<24-22,WELDON>我恐怕没法那么做
<24-22,WELDON>I'm afraid I can't do that.

836
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,070
<24-23,BECKETT>为什么
<24-23,BECKETT>Why?

837
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,040
<24-24,WELDON>我与劳拉·坎布里奇的谋杀案
<24-24,WELDON>I had nothing to do with Laura Cambridge's murder,

838
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,710
<24-24,WELDON>慈善机构的公款挪用
<24-24,WELDON>or the theft of money from my charity,

839
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,560
<24-24,WELDON>或在过去两天里  其他针对我的任何指控
<24-24,WELDON>or anything else I've been accused of

840
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,750
<24-24,WELDON>都没有任何关系
<24-24,WELDON>in the last 48 hours.

841
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,850
<24-24,WELDON>你觉得这些事都是巧合吗
<24-24,WELDON>Do you think that any of this is a coincidence?

842
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,320
<24-26,WELDON>-罗伯特  -不  你听我说
<24-26,WELDON>- Robert... - No, me here, talking to you,

843
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,280
<24-26,WELDON>这正是他们所期望发生的情况
<24-26,WELDON>this is exactly what they wanted to have happen,

844
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,110
<24-26,WELDON>所以回答是不  我不会把大衣交给你
<24-26,WELDON>So, no, I will not give you my coat.

845
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,760
<24-26,WELDON>肯定有一个针对我的阴谋
<24-26,WELDON>Look, there's a conspiracy against me,

846
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,690
<24-26,WELDON>我不会自己跳进陷阱中
<24-26,WELDON>and I will not voluntarily feed it.

847
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,910
<24-27,CASTLE>什么阴谋
<24-27,CASTLE>What conspiracy?

848
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,650
<24-28,WELDON>我刚决定参加州长竞选
<24-28,WELDON>Don't you think it's funny that all this is happening

849
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,670
<24-28,WELDON>就发生这些事  你不觉得可疑吗
<24-28,WELDON>the moment I consider running for governor?

850
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,970
<24-28,WELDON>里克  我早已习惯与人敌对
<24-28,WELDON>Rick, I'm used to having enemies.

851
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,490
<24-28,WELDON>但这是一项有计划的行动  目的是拉我下台
<24-28,WELDON>But this is an organized effort to destroy me.

852
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,080
<24-28,WELDON>眼下  我不会相信任何人
<24-28,WELDON>So right now, I don't trust anyone.

853
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,050
<25-1,CASTLE>他不交出大衣的理由很正当
<25-1,CASTLE>Well, he has good reason to not turn over his coat.

854
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,600
<25-2,BECKETT>那是  他有罪
<25-2,BECKETT>Yes, guilt.

855
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,400
<25-3,CASTLE>这是个阴谋  就这么不可信吗
<25-3,CASTLE>A conspiracy. Is it so far-fetched?

856
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,600
<25-3,CASTLE>也许劳拉发现了  试图警告他
<25-3,CASTLE>Maybe Laura found out about it and tried to warn him.

857
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,650
<25-4,BECKETT>也可能她与威尔顿确实聊过
<25-4,BECKETT>Or maybe she and Weldon did talk.

858
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,140
<25-4,BECKETT>她以自己的发现质问他
<25-4,BECKETT>She confronted him with what she knew,

859
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,360
<25-4,BECKETT>他便把她杀了
<25-4,BECKETT>and he killed her.

860
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,520
<25-5,CASTLE>我相信阴谋论
<25-5,CASTLE>I believe the conspiracy.

861
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,560
<25-5,CASTLE>我了解威尔顿
<25-5,CASTLE>I mean, I know Weldon.

862
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,610
<25-6,BECKETT>威尔顿也了解你
<25-6,BECKETT>And Weldon knows you.

863
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,300
<25-6,BECKETT>阴谋  诡计
<25-6,BECKETT>Conspiracies, intrigue--

864
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,000
<25-6,BECKETT>这是你的精神食粮
<25-6,BECKETT>That's your bread and butter.

865
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,020
<25-6,BECKETT>这正是你会买账的故事
<25-6,BECKETT>That's exactly the kind of story that you would respond to.

866
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,210
<25-7,CASTLE>不好意思  你是说他在耍我吗
<25-7,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Are--are you suggesting he's playing me?

867
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,630
<25-8,BECKETT>我是说你至少要考虑这种可能性
<25-8,BECKETT>I am suggesting that you consider the possibility.

868
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,720
<25-8,BECKETT>我要遵从程序
<25-8,BECKETT>I have a procedure to follow.

869
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,700
<25-8,BECKETT>他不愿意主动交出大衣
<25-8,BECKETT>He didn't provide his coat willingly,

870
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,620
<25-8,BECKETT>所以我得去申请法院命令
<25-8,BECKETT>so I'm gonna have to get a court order.

871
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,570
<25-9,CASTLE>纽约警局为调查贪污和谋杀
<25-9,CASTLE>Look, once word gets out that the NYPD

872
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,300
<25-9,CASTLE>而传讯他的衣物
<25-9,CASTLE>subpoenaed his clothing in connection with...

873
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,850
<25-9,CASTLE>这消息一旦传出去
<25-9,CASTLE>embezzlement and murder,

874
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,320
<25-9,CASTLE>他的职业生涯就完了
<25-9,CASTLE>that man's career will be over.

875
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,110
<25-10,BECKETT>若他是无辜的则不会
<25-10,BECKETT>Not if he's innocent.

876
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,050
<25-11,CASTLE>你开什么玩笑  凯特  这是政治啊
<25-11,CASTLE>Are you kidding me? Kate, this is politics.

877
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,650
<25-11,CASTLE>感觉即是事实
<25-11,CASTLE>Perception is reality.

878
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,590
<25-11,CASTLE>真相并不重要
<25-11,CASTLE>The truth won't matter.

879
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,070
<25-12,BECKETT>那我要怎么做  里克
<25-12,BECKETT>What am I supposed to do, Rick?

880
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,660
<25-12,BECKETT>我不能因对他不方便
<25-12,BECKETT>I can't just stop being a cop

881
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,080
<25-12,BECKETT>就不尽作为警察的职责
<25-12,BECKETT>just because it's inconvenient.

882
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,410
<25-13,CASTLE>不是  不是  你可以等等
<25-13,CASTLE>No. No, no, no, just... you can wait.

883
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,110
<25-13,CASTLE>好吗  先找其他线索
<25-13,CASTLE>All right? For something else, for another lead.

884
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,660
<25-14,BECKETT>然后等大衣被销毁吗
<25-14,BECKETT>For the coat to disappear?

885
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,420
<25-14,BECKETT>你觉得我不知道这里面的利害关系吗
<25-14,BECKETT>You don't think I don't know what's at stake here?

886
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,880
<25-14,BECKETT>你觉得我真想这么做吗
<25-14,BECKETT>Do you think I actually want to do this?

887
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,500
<25-15,CASTLE>那就别做
<25-15,CASTLE>Then don't do it.

888
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,720
<25-16,BECKETT>我没有选择
<25-16,BECKETT>I don't have a choice.

889
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,670
<26-1,WELDON>我的办公室
<26-1,WELDON>My office is cooperating

890
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,200
<26-1,WELDON>正全力配合这两项调查
<26-1,WELDON>fully with both investigations.

891
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,420
<26-1,WELDON>站在这里  我可以充满信心的说
<26-1,WELDON>And I stand here with 100% confidence

892
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,410
<26-1,WELDON>全面而深入的调查
<26-1,WELDON>that a full and thorough investigation

893
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,030
<26-1,WELDON>会证明这些指控都是不实的
<26-1,WELDON>will reveal that I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing.

894
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,380
<26-2,MARTHA>你还相信他吗
<26-2,MARTHA>You still believe him?

895
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,900
<26-3,CASTLE>相信
<26-3,CASTLE>I do.

896
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,130
<26-4,MARTHA>你以前曾在另一个朋友身上
<26-4,MARTHA>You've been down this road before

897
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,150
<26-4,MARTHA>碰到同样的事
<26-4,MARTHA>with a friend.

898
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,470
<26-4,MARTHA>你曾相信戴米安·韦斯莱
<26-4,MARTHA>You believed Damian Westlake.

899
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,050
<26-4,MARTHA>而他正因谋杀在蹲大牢
<26-4,MARTHA>He's rotting in prison for murder.

900
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,720
<26-5,CASTLE>戴米安和我是童年玩伴
<26-5,CASTLE>Damian and I were kids together.

901
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,750
<26-5,CASTLE>相信他是感情用事
<26-5,CASTLE>Believing in him was sentiment.

902
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,630
<26-5,CASTLE>我的经验告诉我  威尔顿是无辜的
<26-5,CASTLE>My experience tells me, Weldon is innocent.

903
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,260
<26-5,CASTLE>我的经验告诉我  现在这种情况有什么事
<26-5,CASTLE>My experience tells me, there's something very wrong

904
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,410
<26-5,CASTLE>非常的不对劲
<26-5,CASTLE>with this whole situation.

905
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,380
<26-6,MARTHA>这样的话
<26-6,MARTHA>In that case,

906
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,740
<26-6,MARTHA>也许是时候给朋友打电话了
<26-6,MARTHA>maybe it's time to phone a friend.

907
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,270
<27-1,MYSTERIOUS MAN>就站那儿吧  卡塞尔先生
<27-1,MYSTERIOUS MAN>Right there, Mr. Castle.

908
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,890
<27-1,MYSTERIOUS MAN>站在那儿就行了
<27-1,MYSTERIOUS MAN>That'll be fine.

909
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,700
<27-2,CASTLE>你知道威尔顿并不是幕后黑手
<27-2,CASTLE>You know Weldon's not behind this.

910
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,110
<27-2,CASTLE>所以你伸出了援手
<27-2,CASTLE>That's why you offered your help.

911
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,470
<27-2,CASTLE>关于阴谋  他说对了  不是吗
<27-2,CASTLE>He's right about the conspiracy, isn't he?

912
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,320
<27-3,MYSTERIOUS MAN>他没说错
<27-3,MYSTERIOUS MAN>He isn't wrong.

913
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,380
<27-4,CASTLE>我该做什么
<27-4,CASTLE>So what do I do?

914
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,850
<27-4,CASTLE>怎么才能帮到他
<27-4,CASTLE>How do I help him?

915
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,690
<27-5,MYSTERIOUS MAN>仔细听听证据
<27-5,MYSTERIOUS MAN>Listen to the evidence.

916
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,990
<27-5,MYSTERIOUS MAN>就像劳拉做的那样
<27-5,MYSTERIOUS MAN>That's what Laura did.

917
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,240
<27-6,CASTLE>劳拉与市长的录像
<27-6,CASTLE>I-I watched the video

918
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,900
<27-6,CASTLE>我看了快一百遍了
<27-6,CASTLE>of Laura and the mayor a hundred times.

919
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,980
<27-6,CASTLE>什么都没有
<27-6,CASTLE>There's nothing there.

920
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,230
<27-7,MYSTERIOUS MAN>我不是这个意思  卡塞尔先生
<27-7,MYSTERIOUS MAN>That's not what I said, Mr. Castle.

921
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,240
<28-1,BECKETT>我在这个案子以前见过威尔顿几次
<28-1,BECKETT>I met Weldon a few times before this.

922
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,120
<28-1,BECKETT>我喜欢他
<28-1,BECKETT>I liked him.

923
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,110
<28-2,RYAN>点起这把烧身之火的人不是你
<28-2,RYAN>You didn't set his house on fire.

924
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,240
<28-2,RYAN>确实不是
<28-2,RYAN>No.

925
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,220
<28-3,BECKETT>但我却火上浇油
<28-3,BECKETT>I just threw gasoline on it.

927
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,650
<29-1,CASTLE>谢谢你过来
<29-1,CASTLE>Thanks for coming.

928
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,890
<29-1,CASTLE>我们上次闹得那么僵  我都不确定你会来
<29-1,CASTLE>I wasn't sure that you would, given the way we left things.

929
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,240
<29-2,BECKETT>我不会为尽职尽责而道歉  卡塞尔
<29-2,BECKETT>I can't apologize for doing my job, Castle.

930
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,990
<29-3,CASTLE>我也绝不会如此要求
<29-3,CASTLE>And I would never ask you to.

931
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,570
<29-4,BECKETT>你叫我来有什么事
<29-4,BECKETT>So why did you call me here?

932
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,910
<29-5,CASTLE>我灵光一现
<29-5,CASTLE>Because I had an epiphany.

933
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,450
<29-5,CASTLE>一直以来  我们一直在"看"证据
<29-5,CASTLE>All this time, we've been looking for evidence...

934
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,910
<29-5,CASTLE>而我们实际上应该去"听"
<29-5,CASTLE>when we should've been listening instead.

935
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,640
<29-5,CASTLE>事情开端是劳拉告诉埃德加·纳瓦罗
<29-5,CASTLE>This all started when Laura told Edgar Navarro

936
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,630
<29-5,CASTLE>她在电话里听到一些
<29-5,CASTLE>she heard something on a call,

937
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,440
<29-5,CASTLE>她不该听到的事情
<29-5,CASTLE>something she wasn't supposed to hear.

938
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:31,910
<29-5,CASTLE>我们作家把这称为"引发事件"
<29-5,CASTLE>We writers call this "the inciting incident."

939
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,290
<29-5,CASTLE>不管她在跟谁说  不管她听到什么
<29-5,CASTLE>Whoever she spoke to, whatever she heard,

940
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,600
<29-5,CASTLE>是导致她被杀的原因
<29-5,CASTLE>is what led to her murder.

941
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,740
<29-6,BECKETT>这有什么帮助呢
<29-6,BECKETT>Well, what does it matter?

942
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,140
<29-6,BECKETT>我的意思是  硬盘驱动器被偷
<29-6,BECKETT>I mean, the hard drive is stolen.

943
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,480
<29-6,BECKETT>聊天纪录没了
<29-6,BECKETT>The recording is gone.

944
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,270
<29-6,BECKETT>我们永远没法知道她在电话中听到了什么
<29-6,BECKETT>We'll never know what she heard on that call.

945
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,420
<29-7,CASTLE>对  但我们有可能得知她是从谁那听到的
<29-7,CASTLE>No, but we might know who she heard it from.

946
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,770
<29-7,CASTLE>你记得劳拉在哥谭11频道
<29-7,CASTLE>You remember... how Laura fell asleep

947
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,020
<29-7,CASTLE>观看那些副带时睡着了吗
<29-7,CASTLE>watching those b-roll tapes at Gotham 11?

948
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,220
<29-9,CASTLE>她只是闭上了眼
<29-9,CASTLE>She was closing her eyes.

949
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,420
<29-9,CASTLE>她没在看带子  她在听声音
<29-9,CASTLE>She wasn't watching the tape, she was listening to them.

950
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,650
<29-10,BECKETT>所以你是说她在辨认来电者的声音
<29-10,BECKETT>So you're saying she was trying to I.D. our caller's voice?

951
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,670
<29-11,CASTLE>我让萨拉  女神的接线员
<29-11,CASTLE>I had Sarah, our Goddess dispatcher,

952
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,680
<29-11,CASTLE>听听那些副带
<29-11,CASTLE>listen to those b-roll tapes.

953
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,590
<29-12,SARAH>是他  我肯定
<29-12,SARAH>It's him. I'm sure of it.

954
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,570
<29-12,SARAH>他是劳拉的常客之一
<29-12,SARAH>He was one of Laura's regulars.

955
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,920
<29-13,CASTLE>给她看看是谁
<29-13,CASTLE>Show her who.

956
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,610
<29-13,CASTLE>我还能在这呆多久
<29-13,CASTLE>How much more time can I spend here?

957
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,540
<29-14,BECKETT>是市长吗
<29-14,BECKETT>The mayor?

958
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,980
<29-14,BECKETT>先生  再二十分钟  之后我们得
<29-14,BECKETT>Another 20 minutes, sir, then we have to

959
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,610
<29-15,SARAH>-回办公室开会  -是他
<29-15,SARAH>- get back to your office for your meeting with... - That guy.

960
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,940
<29-16,CASTLE>乔丹·诺里斯
<29-16,CASTLE>Jordan Norris--

961
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,210
<29-16,CASTLE>市长幕僚长的副助理
<29-16,CASTLE>Deputy assistant to the mayor's chief of staff.

962
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,700
<30-1,BECKETT>诺里斯先生  你曾告诉我们
<30-1,BECKETT>Mr. Norris, you told us

963
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,800
<30-1,BECKETT>你不认识劳拉·坎布里奇
<30-1,BECKETT>that you didn't know Laura Cambridge.

964
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,330
<30-2,NORRIS>对
<30-2,NORRIS>That's right.

965
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,080
<30-3,BECKETT>但你89岁高龄的祖母
<30-3,BECKETT>And yet your 89-year-old grandmother,

966
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,690
<30-3,BECKETT>格莱塔·马肯森却认识死者
<30-3,BECKETT>Greta Markenson did.

967
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,500
<30-3,BECKETT>根据性爱电话记录
<30-3,BECKETT>According to the phone sex records,

968
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,490
<30-3,BECKETT>劳拉收到过多通你祖母的来电
<30-3,BECKETT>Laura received numerous phone calls from her.

969
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,010
<30-4,CASTLE>这让可怜的格莱塔显得很是调皮
<30-4,CASTLE>Which made poor Greta look pretty frisky?

970
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,730
<30-4,CASTLE>直到我们得知  你一直在她家看房子
<30-4,CASTLE>Until we realized, you'd been house-sitting at her apartment.

971
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,550
<30-5,NORRIS>我  我可能时不时会打那种服务电话
<30-5,NORRIS>I-I may have called that service from time to time,

972
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,910
<30-5,NORRIS>但我从来不知道对方是谁
<30-5,NORRIS>but I-I never knew who I was talking to.

973
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,870
<30-5,NORRIS>我如何得知呢
<30-5,NORRIS>I mean, how would I?

974
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,990
<30-6,BECKETT>我们待会会查的
<30-6,BECKETT>We'll get to that in a minute.

975
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,770
<30-6,BECKETT>与此同时  我们查了你的通话记录
<30-6,BECKETT>In the meantime, we checked your phone records,

976
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:56,190
<30-6,BECKETT>一个月前你往一部一次性手机发了这条短信
<30-6,BECKETT>and you sent this text to a burner cell about a month ago.

977
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,600
<30-6,BECKETT>对很多人来说
<30-6,BECKETT>Now to most people,

978
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,730
<30-6,BECKETT>那看上去就是一连串随机的号码
<30-6,BECKETT>that would look like a series of random numbers.

979
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,150
<30-6,BECKETT>我们调查发现
<30-6,BECKETT>So we looked into it.

980
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,820
<30-6,BECKETT>那是市长威尔顿和他慈善机构的
<30-6,BECKETT>Those are actually numbers to a bank account

981
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,320
<30-6,BECKETT>一个银行账户信息
<30-6,BECKETT>for mayor Weldon and his charity.

982
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,190
<30-6,BECKETT>而有人能利用此账户
<30-6,BECKETT>Numbers that someone could've used

983
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,160
<30-6,BECKETT>陷害市长挪用公款
<30-6,BECKETT>to make it look like the mayor was embezzling money.

984
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,560
<30-7,CASTLE>市长信任你
<30-7,CASTLE>The man who trusted you,

985
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,080
<30-7,CASTLE>而你却出卖他
<30-7,CASTLE>and you sold him out.

986
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,690
<30-7,CASTLE>乔丹  他们给你开了什么条件
<30-7,CASTLE>So what did they give you, Jordan?

987
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,200
<30-7,CASTLE>他们承诺给你什么
<30-7,CASTLE>What'd they promise you?

988
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,260
<30-8,NORRIS>我以为这只关乎钱财
<30-8,NORRIS>I-I thought this was just about the money.

989
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,220
<30-8,NORRIS>我  我不知道  我不知道他们试图毁掉他
<30-8,NORRIS>I-I didn't know. I didn't know they'd try to destroy him.

990
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,180
<30-9,CASTLE>当你发现你将背叛你的上司时
<30-9,CASTLE>And when you found out you'd betrayed the man you work for,

991
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,450
<30-9,CASTLE>你很备受煎熬  对吗
<30-9,CASTLE>it ate you up, didn't it?

992
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,460
<30-9,CASTLE>苦不堪言以致某晚在喝了很多杯龙舌酒后
<30-9,CASTLE>So much so that one night after too many shots of tequila,

993
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,200
<30-9,CASTLE>你打电话给劳拉  全盘托出
<30-9,CASTLE>you called Laura and you let it all spill out.

994
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,710
<30-9,CASTLE>你不想说的
<30-9,CASTLE>Oh, you didn't mean to,

995
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,550
<30-9,CASTLE>但她如此善于倾听
<30-9,CASTLE>but she was such a good listener.

996
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,610
<30-10,NORRIS>那是匿名电话  我以为是安全的
<30-10,NORRIS>It was anonymous. I-I was supposed to be safe.

997
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,590
<30-11,CASTLE>但你没有  因为她是个作家
<30-11,CASTLE>But you weren't, because she was a writer,

998
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,770
<30-11,CASTLE>你给了她绝妙的题材
<30-11,CASTLE>and you gave her the story of her life.

999
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,370
<30-11,CASTLE>她追查你  出现在你面前
<30-11,CASTLE>So she tracked you down. She confronted you.

1000
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,880
<30-11,CASTLE>她要揭发你和你的朋友
<30-11,CASTLE>She was gonna blow the whistle on you, on your friends.

1001
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,750
<30-11,CASTLE>必须得阻止她
<30-11,CASTLE>She had to be stopped.

1002
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,300
<30-12,BECKETT>乔丹  我们跟你门卫谈过了
<30-12,BECKETT>We talked to your doorman, Jordan.

1003
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,710
<30-12,BECKETT>我们知道那晚她去找过你
<30-12,BECKETT>We know that she visited you that night.

1004
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,200
<30-13,NORRIS>好吧  她是去过我家
<30-13,NORRIS>Okay. She was there.

1005
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,600
<30-13,NORRIS>但  她只呆了二十分钟就离开了
<30-13,NORRIS>But... sh-she left after 20 minutes.

1006
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,510
<30-13,NORRIS>我没杀她
<30-13,NORRIS>I... I didn't kill her.

1007
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,810
<30-13,NORRIS>你没必要
<30-13,NORRIS>You didn't have to.

1008
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,690
<30-14,BECKETT>你要做的只是打给那个一次性电话
<30-14,BECKETT>All you had to do was call that same burner phone.

1009
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,780
<30-14,BECKETT>接听者派了一名杀手
<30-14,BECKETT>And whoever answered sent a man,

1010
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,460
<30-14,BECKETT>一个无名无姓的杀手
<30-14,BECKETT>a man without a face,

1011
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,320
<30-14,BECKETT>他扼死了劳拉·坎布里奇
<30-14,BECKETT>who choked the life out of Laura Cambridge.

1012
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,120
<30-14,BECKETT>然后他闯入她家和她工作的地方
<30-14,BECKETT>And then he broke into her home and her work

1013
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,590
<30-14,BECKETT>销毁她手中所掌握的信息的所有证据
<30-14,BECKETT>and he destroyed all of the evidence of everything she knew.

1014
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,380
<30-15,CASTLE>乔丹  机主是谁
<30-15,CASTLE>Whose phone was it, Jordan?

1015
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,750
<30-16,NORRIS>你们不懂
<30-16,NORRIS>You don't understand.

1016
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,200
<30-16,NORRIS>那些人
<30-16,NORRIS>These people...

1017
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,800
<30-16,NORRIS>比你们所想的更加危险
<30-16,NORRIS>They're more dangerous than you know.

1018
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,650
<30-17,BECKETT>你将面临二十年监禁
<30-17,BECKETT>You are looking at 20 years in prison.

1019
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,170
<30-17,BECKETT>我给你指条明路
<30-17,BECKETT>I am offering you a way out.

1020
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,020
<30-18,BECKETT>你打电话给谁了
<30-18,BECKETT>Now who did you call?

1021
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,910
<30-18,BECKETT>我要知道
<30-18,BECKETT>I want a name.

1022
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,810
<30-18,BECKETT>你打给谁了
<30-18,BECKETT>Who did you call?

1023
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,550
<30-19,NORRIS>我
<30-19,NORRIS>I, uh...

1024
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,500
<30-20,BECKETT>说他的名字  乔丹
<30-20,BECKETT>A name, Jordan.

1025
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,420
<30-21,BECKETT>说吧
<30-21,BECKETT>Say it.

1026
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,910
<30-21,BECKETT>好吧
<30-21,BECKETT>Okay.

1027
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,230
<30-22,NORRIS>我打给
<30-22,NORRIS>The person that I called was--

1028
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,430
<30-23,BILL MOSS>如果你们不介意的话
<30-23,BILL MOSS>If it's all the same to you,

1029
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,510
<30-23,BILL MOSS>我希望你们不要继续盘问我的当事人
<30-23,BILL MOSS>I prefer my client not be asked any more questions.

1030
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,110
<30-24,NORRIS>你的当事人
<30-24,NORRIS>Your client?

1031
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,140
<30-25,MOSS>诺里斯先生  我是比尔·莫斯
<30-25,MOSS>Mr. Norris, I'm Bill Moss.

1032
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,200
<30-25,MOSS>从现在开始  没我在场
<30-25,MOSS>From now on, please don't speak to anybody

1033
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,900
<30-25,MOSS>别说任何话
<30-25,MOSS>outside of my presence.

1034
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,340
<30-25,MOSS>我已被聘为你的代表律师
<30-25,MOSS>I've been retained to represent you.

1035
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,560
<30-26,BECKETT>谁聘请的
<30-26,BECKETT>By who?

1036
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,520
<30-27,MOSS>我们到此为止
<30-27,MOSS>We're done here.

1037
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,510
<31-1,GATES>看来我们的市长能喘口气  伺机再战了
<31-1,GATES>It seems our mayor will live to fight another day.

1038
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,340
<31-1,GATES>正义得到声张
<31-1,GATES>Justice has prevailed.

1039
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,090
<31-2,BECKETT>可劳拉·坎布里奇死得不明不白
<31-2,BECKETT>Not for Laura Cambridge.

1040
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,470
<31-3,GATES>我们会以协助犯罪起诉诺里斯
<31-3,GATES>We charged Mr. Norris with criminal facilitation.

1041
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,330
<31-3,GATES>已经很不错了
<31-3,GATES>That's something.

1042
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,130
<31-4,BECKETT>乔丹·诺里斯只是个小兵
<31-4,BECKETT>Jordan Norris is a pawn.

1043
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,990
<31-4,BECKETT>我要的是幕后操纵者
<31-4,BECKETT>I want the people controlling him.

1044
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,450
<31-5,GATES>凯特  这是场持久战
<31-5,GATES>Oh, it's a long game, Kate.

1045
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,580
<31-5,GATES>逐一击破吧
<31-5,GATES>Play it piece by piece.

1046
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,810
<32-1,CASTLE>你为什么还要放弃所有的计划
<32-1,CASTLE>Then why would you abandon all your plans?

1047
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,100
<32-1,CASTLE>所有控罪都撤销了
<32-1,CASTLE>You've been cleared of all charges.

1048
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,610
<32-2,WELDON>就一个杀掉他笔下所有人物的人来说
<32-2,WELDON>You know, for someone who kills off all his characters,

1049
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,420
<32-2,WELDON>你有股奇特的
<32-2,WELDON>you have a strange

1050
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,160
<32-2,WELDON>固执的乐观  但是  不行啊
<32-2,WELDON>stubborn streak of optimism in you, but, no.

1051
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,630
<32-2,WELDON>两年后我不能竞选州长
<32-2,WELDON>I can't run for governor in two years,

1052
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,000
<32-2,WELDON>六年后也不能竞选总统
<32-2,WELDON>I can't run for president in six.

1053
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,340
<32-2,WELDON>我的政治梦想
<32-2,WELDON>That dream...

1054
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,000
<32-2,WELDON>破灭了
<32-2,WELDON>is done.

1055
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,090
<32-3,CASTLE>总有些我们能补救的  你是清白的
<32-3,CASTLE>There's gotta be something we can do. You're innocent.

1056
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,490
<32-4,WELDON>有点太清白了
<32-4,WELDON>A little too innocent.

1057
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,780
<32-4,WELDON>现在我明白了  背后有股势力
<32-4,WELDON>There are people out there-- I realize it now--

1058
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,100
<32-4,WELDON>他们的权力遍布纽约内外
<32-4,WELDON>People who control what goes on in this city and beyond.

1059
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,660
<32-4,WELDON>我不跟他们同流合污  所以他们把我踢出局
<32-4,WELDON>I wouldn't play ball, so they took me out the game.

1060
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,880
<32-4,WELDON>他们已经做出决定
<32-4,WELDON>It's been decided.

1061
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,720
<32-4,WELDON>我就只能走到这一步
<32-4,WELDON>This is as far as I get.

1062
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,270
<32-5,CASTLE>那你现在打算怎么做
<32-5,CASTLE>So what are you gonna do now?

1063
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,580
<32-5,CASTLE>我
<32-5,CASTLE>I...

1064
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:07,200
<32-6,WELDON>会继续在世上最棒的城市
<32-6,WELDON>am going to continue being an outstanding mayor

1065
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,090
<32-6,WELDON>做个杰出的市长
