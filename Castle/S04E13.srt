<4-3,BECKETT>格林先生  你对死者弗兰斯科了解如何
<4-3,BECKETT>Mr. Greene, how well did you know our victim--Francisco?

80
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,580
<4-4,GREEN>弗兰斯科做我们的评委快二十年了
<4-4,GREEN>Uh, Francisco's been our judge for almost two decades.

81
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,140
<4-4,GREEN>他比任何人都在乎这些狗
<4-4,GREEN>No one cared about dogs more than he did.

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,500
<4-5,BECKETT>他有可以提供情况的家人吗
<4-5,BECKETT>Did he have any family that we could talk to?

83
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,650
<4-6,GREEN>罗亚尔就是他的家人
<4-6,GREEN>Royal was his family.

84
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,950
<4-7,CASTLE>这狗真帅
<4-7,CASTLE>Oh, that's a handsome pooch.

85
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,030
<4-8,GREEN>弗兰斯科非常爱它
<4-8,GREEN>Francisco loved him very much.

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,980
<4-8,GREEN>事实上
<4-8,GREEN>The truth is,

87
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,620
<4-8,GREEN>他和狗相处得比和狗主人还好
<4-8,GREEN>he got along with dogs a lot better than their owners.

88
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,990
<4-9,CASTLE>所以他精通狗语
<4-9,CASTLE>So dog whisperer, check.

89
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,100
<4-9,CASTLE>而不擅长人语
<4-9,CASTLE>People whisperer, not so much.

90
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,720
<4-10,BECKETT>他和狗主人之间有矛盾吗
<4-10,BECKETT>Did he have any problems with any of the owners?

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,220
<4-11,GREEN>你在暗示什么
<4-11,GREEN>What are you suggesting?

92
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,620
<4-12,BECKETT>他在选出选秀第一名后的
<4-12,BECKETT>Just that he was killed about a half an hour

93
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,410
<4-12,BECKETT>半小时左右就被杀害了
<4-12,BECKETT>after he gave out best in show.

94
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,690
<4-13,GREEN>我承认  选秀狗的主人有时会很激动
<4-13,GREEN>I'll admit, show dog owners can be passionate people,

95
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,380
<4-13,GREEN>但不会激动到这种程度
<4-13,GREEN>but not to this extent.

96
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,460
<4-14,CASTLE>有人把那条皮带缠在他的脖子上了
<4-14,CASTLE>Somebody wrapped that leash around his neck.

97
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,040
<4-15,BECKETT>我们需要一份包括
<4-15,BECKETT>We'll need a list of the names

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,130
<4-15,BECKETT>所有参赛者以及可能进出
<4-15,BECKETT>of all of the contestants, along with anyone

99
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,920
<4-15,BECKETT>这个房间的人员的名单
<4-15,BECKETT>that might have had access to this room.

100
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,990
<4-16,GREEN>没问题
<4-16,GREEN>Of course.

101
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,660
<5-1,CASTLE>这不是弗兰斯科·普拉尔的狗嘛
<5-1,CASTLE>Isn't this Francisco Pilar's dog?

102
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,160
<5-2,GREEN>是的  这就是罗亚尔
<5-2,GREEN>Yes, that's Royal.

103
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,930
<5-2,GREEN>我们觉得最好还是让它离开那房间
<5-2,GREEN>We thought it best to keep him out of the room.

104
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,320
<5-3,CASTLE>它干嘛这样做
<5-3,CASTLE>Why is he doing that?

105
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,800
<5-4,GREEN>我们发现它时  他正在尸体旁边
<5-4,GREEN>He was doing the same thing by the body

106
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,050
<5-4,GREEN>做同样的动作
<5-4,GREEN>when we found him.

107
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,190
<5-4,GREEN>也许是他表示悲痛的方式吧
<5-4,GREEN>Maybe some sort of grieving process.

108
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,650
<5-4,GREEN>我去给你写名单
<5-4,GREEN>I'll get you that list of names.

109
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,740
<5-5,BECKETT>谢了
<5-5,BECKETT>Thank you.

110
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,930
<5-6,CASTLE>所以凶案发生时
<5-6,CASTLE>So the dog was at the crime scene

111
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,830
<5-6,CASTLE>这狗正在犯罪现场
<5-6,CASTLE>at the time of the murder.

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
<5-7,BECKETT>你想让我们干嘛  带它去问话吗
<5-7,BECKETT>What do you want us to do, bring him in for questioning?

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,640
<5-8,CASTLE>我只是想说  人类最好的朋友
<5-8,CASTLE>I'm just saying, would man's best friend

114
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,660
<5-8,CASTLE>会眼睁睁看着它的主人被袭击吗
<5-8,CASTLE>stand idly by while his master was attacked?

115
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,050
<5-9,BECKETT>要是它真的去干预了
<5-9,BECKETT>And if he did intervene,

116
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,210
<5-9,BECKETT>也许它还能留下点DNA或微量迹证
<5-9,BECKETT>maybe he got D.N.A. or trace evidence on him

117
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,660
<5-9,BECKETT>帮我们找到凶手
<5-9,BECKETT>that could lead to our killer.

118
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,890
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>我可能找到了一条线索
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>May have a lead of my own.

119
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,560
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>有个输掉了比赛的选手刚递交了
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>One of the losing contestants just filed this appeal

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,620
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>对弗兰斯科裁决的上诉  一个叫大卫·赫南德的人
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>of Francisco's decision-- a guy named David Hernand.

121
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,560
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>他们说他气愤到
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>They said he was so angry

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,230
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>脑门上的血管一跳一跳的
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>that the vein in his forehead was visibly throbbing.

123
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,730
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>显然  狗狗选秀就是这家伙的全部人生
<5-10,KEVIN RYAN>Apparently, dog shows are this guy's whole life.

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,210
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>我对弗兰斯科的死感到不安吗
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>Was I upset about Francisco's death?

125
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,400
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>当然
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>Sure.

126
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,280
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>但他对选秀第一名的裁决更令我生气
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>I was more upset about his choice for best in show.

127
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,090
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>那缎带明明该是我家麦克斯的
<6-1,DAVID HERNAND>That ribbon belonged to my Max.

128
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,240
<6-2,BECKETT>赫南德先生  你5点15到35分时
<6-2,BECKETT>Mr. Hernand, can you account for your whereabouts

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,320
<6-2,BECKETT>人在何处
<6-2,BECKETT>between 5:15 and 5:35?

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,670
<6-3,HERNAND>我就在我的修整处这里
<6-3,HERNAND>Yeah, I was right here at my grooming station

131
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,350
<6-3,HERNAND>填写我的上诉  我可没杀他好吗
<6-3,HERNAND>filing my appeal-- oh, I didn't kill him. Okay?

132
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,510
<6-3,HERNAND>鉴于他干的各种勾当
<6-3,HERNAND>Given everything he was into,

133
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,240
<6-3,HERNAND>我觉得他是自作自受
<6-3,HERNAND>I'd say, he brought it on himself.

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,700
<6-4,BECKETT>他干了什么勾当呢
<6-4,BECKETT>And what exactly was he into?

135
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,870
<6-5,HERNAND>有传闻说
<6-5,HERNAND>Well, rumor has it...

136
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,380
<6-5,HERNAND>他收受了贿赂
<6-5,HERNAND>he was on the take.

137
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,480
<6-6,CASTLE>你是说  有人为左右选秀而贿赂他了吗
<6-6,CASTLE>Are you saying, he was taking bribes to fix dog shows?

138
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,610
<6-7,HERNAND>狗狗选秀的赌盘  可是一笔大生意
<6-7,HERNAND>Betting on dog shows-- it's a big business.

139
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,010
<6-7,HERNAND>他被发现和一些非常可疑的人在一起
<6-7,HERNAND>And he was seen with some pretty shady characters.

140
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,840
<6-7,HERNAND>一些和拉斯维加斯有关联的人
<6-7,HERNAND>People with ties to Vegas.

141
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,470
<6-8,BECKETT>这可是很严重的指控
<6-8,BECKETT>That's a serious allegation.

142
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,350
<6-8,BECKETT>你有证据吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Do you have any proof to back it up?

143
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,970
<6-9,HERNAND>你想要证据
<6-9,HERNAND>You want proof?

144
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,920
<6-9,HERNAND>那就是弗兰斯科选出的第一名
<6-9,HERNAND>That's who Francisco selected best in show.

145
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,300
<6-10,HERNAND>看看那杂种狗的样子
<6-10,HERNAND>Just look at that mutt.

146
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,570
<6-10,HERNAND>再看看我的麦克斯
<6-10,HERNAND>Now back to my Max.

147
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,860
<6-10,HERNAND>再看看那杂种狗
<6-10,HERNAND>Now the mutt.

148
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,150
<6-10,HERNAND>这就是我的证据
<6-10,HERNAND>That's all the proof I need.

149
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,580
<7-1,BECKETT>真的吗  狗狗选秀上有大赌注吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Really? There's big money riding on dog shows?

150
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,240
<7-2,CASTLE>说起来其实挺精明的
<7-2,CASTLE>It's actually kind of ingenious.

151
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,050
<7-2,CASTLE>人人都小心翼翼审视着足球赛
<7-2,CASTLE>You know, everyone's got football, basketball,

152
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,530
<7-2,CASTLE>篮球赛和赛马
<7-2,CASTLE>horse racing under a microscope,

153
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,810
<7-2,CASTLE>试图找到违规的蛛丝马迹
<7-2,CASTLE>looking for the slightest hint of impropriety.

154
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,420
<7-2,CASTLE>谁会关注狗狗选秀呢
<7-2,CASTLE>Who's looking at dog shows?

155
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,710
<7-3,BECKETT>我会让莱恩追查这事
<7-3,BECKETT>I'm gonna have Ryan look into it

156
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,500
<7-3,BECKETT>和赫南德的不在场证明的
<7-3,BECKETT>along with Hernand's alibi.

157
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,330
<7-4,ESPOSITO>不管你们在说什么  都可以放一放了
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Whatever you're talking about, it can wait.

158
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,750
<7-4,ESPOSITO>女士  请告诉贝克特探长
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Ma'am, please tell detective Beckett

159
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,390
<7-4,ESPOSITO>你之前所说的话

160
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,050
<7-5,KELLY GUNTHER>选秀结束后我在后台
<7-5,KELLY GUNTHER>I was backstage after the show

161
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,190
<7-5,KELLY GUNTHER>看到一个女人离开弗兰斯科的化妆间
<7-5,KELLY GUNTHER>when I saw a woman leave Francisco's dressing room.

162
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,580
<7-6,BECKETT>你能描述她的样子吗
<7-6,BECKETT>Can you describe her?

163
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,680
<7-7,KELLY>不止如此
<7-7,KELLY>Even better.

164
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,610
<7-7,KELLY>我用手机拍下了一段视频
<7-7,KELLY>I took a video with my phone.

165
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,580
<7-7,KELLY>尽管她带着兜帽和墨镜
<7-7,KELLY>She was wearing a hood and sunglasses,

166
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,970
<7-7,KELLY>我还是一眼就认出了她
<7-7,KELLY>but I recognized her instantly.

167
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,640
<7-7,KELLY>是凯·卡普奇诺
<7-7,KELLY>It was Kay Cappuccio.

168
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,610
<7-8,CASTLE>那个电视真人秀明星吗
<7-8,CASTLE>The reality television star?

169
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,910
<7-9,ESPOSITO>看看拍摄时间
<7-9,ESPOSITO>Check the time stamp.

170
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,170
<7-9,ESPOSITO>正处于凶杀时间范围内
<7-9,ESPOSITO>Right in the middle of our time-of-death window.

180
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,120
<8-1,CASTLE>我不能理解的是
<8-1,CASTLE>Here's what I don't get--

181
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,430
<8-1,CASTLE>为什么凯·卡普奇诺要杀弗兰斯科·普拉尔呢
<8-1,CASTLE>Why would Kay Cappuccio want to kill Francisco Pilar?

182
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,390
<8-2,BECKETT>而我不能理解的是  这个女人
<8-2,BECKETT>Here's what I don't get-- how does this woman

187
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,100
<8-2,BECKETT>却并没有任何真正的才华能解释她的名气
<8-2,BECKETT>all with no discernable talent to account for it?

188
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,630
<8-3,CASTLE>更让人费解的是  为什么她的所有照片
<8-3,CASTLE>Even more perplexing, why in almost every photo

<10-8,KAY>I wanted an explanation as to why

231
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,270
<10-8,KAY>他为什么不愿意训练洛丽塔
<10-8,KAY>he wouldn't train Lolita.

232

<10-9,CASTLE>那他怎么说
<10-9,CASTLE>And what did he tell you?

233
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,390
<10-10,KAY>我实在不愿意谈论这个问题
<10-10,KAY>I would so much rather not go into it.

234
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,300
<10-11,BECKETT>我们掌握了一段你离开弗兰斯科化妆间的视频
<10-11,BECKETT>We've got a video of you leaving Francisco's dressing room

235
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,480
<10-11,BECKETT>时间恰好落在谋杀时间范围内
<10-11,BECKETT>right around the time of the murder.

236
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,770
<10-11,BECKETT>所以是否谈论这个问题由不得你选择
<10-11,BECKETT>So not going into it is not an option.

237
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,590
<10-12,KAY>好吧
<10-12,KAY>Fine.

238
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,860
<10-12,KAY>我们什么也没说
<10-12,KAY>We didn't talk about anything,

239
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,500
<10-12,KAY>因为那时他已经死了
<10-12,KAY>because he was already dead.

240
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,180
<10-13,BECKETT>-你发现了尸体  -是的
<10-13,BECKETT>- You found the body? - Yeah.

241
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,320
<10-15,BECKETT>但是你没有报警
<10-15,BECKETT>And you didn't call 9-1-1?

242
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,940
<10-16,KAY>没有  但我一回到车上立刻就报警了
<10-16,KAY>No, I did as soon as I got into the limo.

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
<10-17,KAY>无伤大雅  不算犯法  对吧
<10-17,KAY>No harm, no foul, right?

244
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,870
<10-18,BECKETT>但是你逃离了犯罪现场
<10-18,BECKETT>You fled a crime scene.

245
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,210
<10-18,BECKETT>好吧
<10-18,BECKETT>All right.

246
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,030
<10-19,KAY>你有没有听过这句话
<10-19,KAY>Have you heard the phrase

247
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,270
<10-19,KAY>"没有绝对的负面报道"
<10-19,KAY>"There's no such thing as bad press"?

248
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,750
<10-19,KAY>但是如果被拍到跟尸体在一起
<10-19,KAY>Having your picture taken with a dead guy

249
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,930
<10-19,KAY>就是这句话的例外
<10-19,KAY>is the exception.

250
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,480
<10-19,KAY>我需要时刻注意自己的形象
<10-19,KAY>I have to be so careful with my image.

251
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,070
<10-19,KAY>我的形象就是我的全部资本
<10-19,KAY>My image is all that I have.

252
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,730
<10-20,CASTLE>是啊  我们刚才也在讨论这个问题
<10-20,CASTLE>Yeah. No, we were just talking about that.

253
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,820
<10-20,CASTLE>卡普奇诺小姐
<10-20,CASTLE>Ms. Cappuccio,

254
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,200
<10-21,BECKETT>弗兰斯科把狗带回来给你时
<10-21,BECKETT>when Francisco brought your dog back,

255
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,150
<10-21,BECKETT>有没有什么异常的表现
<10-21,BECKETT>was he acting unusual at all?

256
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,110
<10-22,KAY>我没有看到他
<10-22,KAY>Oh, I didn't see him.

257
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,330
<10-22,KAY>他来的时候正是我上午十点的健身时间
<10-22,KAY>He showed up in the middle of my 10:00 a.m. workout.

258
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,660
<10-23,PHOEBE>当时我在  是我接收了洛丽塔
<10-23,PHOEBE>I was here, so I took Lolita.

259
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,600
<10-23,PHOEBE>你没说错  他当时的表现是有点奇怪
<10-23,PHOEBE>But you're right. The guy was acting weird.

260
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,250
<10-23,PHOEBE>他一直重复  "她究竟为谁卖命
<10-23,PHOEBE>He kept saying, "Who is she working for?

261
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,830
<10-23,PHOEBE>我知道她背后肯定有人"
<10-23,PHOEBE>I know she's working for somebody."

262
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,920
<10-23,PHOEBE>他看上去真的很疑神疑鬼
<10-23,PHOEBE>He seemed really paranoid.

263
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,680
<10-24,CASTLE>你知道他在说什么吗
<10-24,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what he was talking about?

264
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,920
<10-25,KAY>毫无头绪
<10-25,KAY>No clue.

265
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,220
<10-25,KAY>所以我才决定上门问清楚
<10-25,KAY>That's why I went to go talk with him.

266
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,700
<10-26,BECKETT>好的  我想我们问完了
<10-26,BECKETT>Okay. Well, I guess, then, we are done...

267
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,340
<10-26,BECKETT>暂时而言
<10-26,BECKETT>for now.

268
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,690
<10-26,BECKETT>但是你要保持随传随到
<10-26,BECKETT>Just, uh, stay available for questioning.

269
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,330
<10-27,KAY>天哪  我还可能消失吗
<10-27,KAY>Oh, my god. Like I'm gonna go anywhere?

270
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,890
<10-27,KAY>我每迈出一步都会有成千上万的镜头对准我
<10-27,KAY>I can't take one step without a million people taking my picture.

271
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,460
<11-1,BECKETT>为什么有人
<11-1,BECKETT>Well, it's no mystery

272
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,810
<11-1,BECKETT>不愿与凯共事已经不是个谜题
<11-1,BECKETT>why someone wouldn't want to be in business with Kay.

273
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,440
<11-1,BECKETT>但是为什么弗兰斯科会以为她在为别人做事
<11-1,BECKETT>But why did Francisco think that she was working for someone?

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
<11-2,CASTLE>尤其是她整个人生根本就是什么事都不做
<11-2,CASTLE>Especially since her whole life is about not working.

275
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,610
<11-2,CASTLE>他为什么对她这么疑神疑鬼
<11-2,CASTLE>And what made him so paranoid about her?

276
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,390
<11-3,RYAN>或许他有不可告人的秘密  看上去
<11-3,RYAN>Maybe he had something to hide. Looks like there might be

277
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,390
<11-3,RYAN>流言并不全然是假的  比赛可能真有猫腻
<11-3,RYAN>some truth to those rumors that the fix was in.

278
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,270
<11-4,ESPOSITO>没错  我查了弗兰斯科的财务情况
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I've been going through Francisco's financials.

279
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,440
<11-4,ESPOSITO>单就去年  他有几笔现金存款记录
<11-4,ESPOSITO>He made a bunch of cash deposits over the last year--

280
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,640
<11-4,ESPOSITO>每笔一万元
<11-4,ESPOSITO>10 grand a pop.

281
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,810
<11-4,ESPOSITO>我们回去查看了他近期裁判过的几场选秀
<11-4,ESPOSITO>So we went back and looked at the last few shows he judged.

282
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,420
<11-4,ESPOSITO>死者似乎对高风险参赛者情有独钟
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Our boy had a thing for long shots.

283
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,380
<11-5,RYAN>昨天桑福尔选秀的冠军在维加斯赌场上的
<11-5,RYAN>The line at Vegas on yesterday's Sunfare winner

284
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,630
<11-5,RYAN>赔率达到五十比一
<11-5,RYAN>was 50 to 1.

285
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,260
<11-5,RYAN>真是个不被看好的狗
<11-5,RYAN>A real underdog.

286
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,330
<11-6,CASTLE>还有一点说不通的是
<11-6,CASTLE>Well, what doesn't make any sense is,

287
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,340
<11-6,CASTLE>如果他确实收受贿赂  为什么要杀了他
<11-6,CASTLE>if he was taking the bribes, why would they kill him?

288
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,430
<11-7,ESPOSITO>或许他想要退出
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Maybe he wanted out

289
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,690
<11-7,ESPOSITO>或者开价提高了
<11-7,ESPOSITO>or more money.

290
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,330
<11-8,RYAN>他的行程本上写着每周会与一个理疗师
<11-8,RYAN>His calendar said he had weekly appointments

291
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,670
<11-8,RYAN>见一次面  帕蒂·贝克医生
<11-8,RYAN>with a therapist-- a dr. Patty Barker.

292
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,170
<11-8,RYAN>他死那天刚好有过一次会面
<11-8,RYAN>They had a session the day he died.

293
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,730
<11-8,RYAN>或许她能为我们解开一些迷惑
<11-8,RYAN>Maybe she can fill in some gaps.

294
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,900
<11-9,BECKETT>那把她带回来询问
<11-9,BECKETT>Okay, let's bring her in.

295
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,710
<11-11,LANIE>给你们带了一个小客人
<11-11,LANIE>Brought you guys a little visitor.

296
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,650
<11-12,CASTLE>看这是谁来了  罗亚尔来了
<11-12,CASTLE>Oh, look who it is. It's Royal.

297
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,980
<11-12,CASTLE>瞧瞧你  你真可爱呀
<11-12,CASTLE>Look at you. You're adorable.

298
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,740
<11-13,LANIE>是的  可爱极了
<11-13,LANIE>Okay, adorable.

299
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,510
<11-13,LANIE>我们从他嘴里取样  希望找到人类的DNA
<11-13,LANIE>We swabbed his mouth for human D.N.A.,

300
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,760
<11-13,LANIE>但是我不抱太大希望
<11-13,LANIE>but I don't have high hopes.

301
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,360
<11-13,LANIE>即使之前真有  他分泌那么多唾液...
<11-13,LANIE>Even if there were some, all that slobbering--

302
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,070
<11-13,LANIE>大概早就咽下去了
<11-13,LANIE>it's probably long gone.

303
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,770
<11-14,CASTLE>我们该拿罗亚尔怎么办
<11-14,CASTLE>Hey, what are we gonna do with Royal?

304
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,990
<11-14,CASTLE>我是说  弗兰斯科没有任何亲属
<11-14,CASTLE>I mean, Francisco didn't have any family.

305
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,960
<11-15,LANIE>我真不忍心打电话给动物控制部门
<11-15,LANIE>I didn't have the heart to call animal control.

306
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
<11-16,RYAN>珍妮有个朋友开了一家动物援救机构
<11-16,RYAN>Jenny's friend runs a rescue.

307
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,830
<11-17,CASTLE>或者  我们可以把他留在这儿
<11-17,CASTLE>Or... we could keep him here at the precinct.

308
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,090
<11-17,CASTLE>我是说  我们可以有个吉祥物嘛
<11-17,CASTLE>I mean, we could use a mascot.

309
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,240
<11-18,ESPOSITO>我以为你就是我们的吉祥物
<11-18,ESPOSITO>I thought that's what you were.

310
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,120
<11-18,ESPOSITO>你  你说什么
<11-18,ESPOSITO>That--what's that?

311
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,390
<11-19,CASTLE>伙计  你刚才说什么
<11-19,CASTLE>What's that, buddy?

312
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,040
<11-19,CASTLE>埃斯波西托的幽默感掉进井里爬不出来了
<11-19,CASTLE>Esposito's sense of humor fell down a well and can't get out?

313
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,950
<11-19,CASTLE>拜托
<11-19,CASTLE>Please.

314
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,210
<11-20,BECKETT>好吧  但是只能留到给他找到新家之前
<11-20,BECKETT>Okay, fine, but only until we find him a suitable home.

315
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,070
<11-21,LANIE>那你们得搞清楚他吃哪种狗粮
<11-21,LANIE>Then you better find out what kind of food he eats,

316
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,860
<11-21,LANIE>因为我喂给他的他碰都没碰一下
<11-21,LANIE>because he's not touching the stuff I put out.

317
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,960
<11-22,BECKETT>弗兰斯科家里肯定有
<11-22,BECKETT>Well, there's gotta be some food for him

318
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,930
<11-22,BECKETT>他爱吃的狗粮
<11-22,BECKETT>at Francisco's place.

319
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,710
<11-22,BECKETT>-你们谁去跑一趟吧  -去拿狗粮吗
<11-22,BECKETT>- Who wants to make a run for it? - To go get dog food?

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,640
<11-25,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -莱恩  -埃斯波西托
<11-25,CASTLE>- Castle. - Ryan. - Esposito.

321
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,650
<11-27,CASTLE>那我们就像男人一样的解决吧
<11-27,CASTLE>Well... Shall we settle this like men?

322
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,990
<12-4,BARKER>好的
<12-4,BARKER>All right.

323
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,620
<12-5,CASTLE>三局两胜
<12-5,CASTLE>Two outta three?

324
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,960
<12-6,BARKER>他做我病人已经很多年了
<12-6,BARKER>Oh, he's been my patient for years.

325
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,140
<12-1,BECKETT>只要他的行程允许我们就会见面
<12-1,BECKETT>I see him whenever his travel allows for it.

326
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,660
<12-1,BECKETT>贝克医生  他正在处理什么样的问题
<12-1,BECKETT>Dr. Barker, what kind of issues was he dealing with?

327
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,560
<12-1,BECKETT>他有没有表现出疑心病的迹象
<12-1,BECKETT>Did he ever exhibit signs of paranoia?

328
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,400
<12-2,BARKER>没有  只是偶尔的抑郁
<12-2,BARKER>No. The occasional bout of depression,

329
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,990
<12-2,BARKER>导致了他的自卑
<12-2,BARKER>which then led to low self-esteem,

330
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,790
<12-2,BARKER>又导致了暴食
<12-2,BARKER>Which led to binge eating, uh...

331
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,220
<12-3,CASTLE>饮食问题
<12-3,CASTLE>An eating problem?

332
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,510
<12-3,CASTLE>还真是看不出来
<12-3,CASTLE>You wouldn't know it to look at him.

333
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,510
<12-4,BARKER>他的饮食习惯非常可怕
<12-4,BARKER>Oh, his diet was horrible.

334
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,610
<12-4,BARKER>哦  垃圾桶里的残羹剩饭
<12-4,BARKER>Oh, scraps from the garbage,

335
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,470
<12-4,BARKER>死鸟  甚至是他自己的粪便
<12-4,BARKER>dead birds, even his own feces.

336
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,100
<12-5,CASTLE>我们这里说的不是弗兰斯科吧
<12-5,CASTLE>We're not talking about Francisco here, are we?

337
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,800
<12-6,BARKER>你以为我是弗兰斯科的心理医生吗
<12-6,BARKER>Oh, y-you thought I was Francisco's therapist?

338
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,270
<12-6,BARKER>天呐  不  不
<12-6,BARKER>H-heavens no, no.

339
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,680
<12-6,BARKER>我的病人是罗亚尔
<12-6,BARKER>My patient is Royal.

340
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,060
<12-7,BARKER>我是一个犬类治疗师
<12-7,BARKER>Well, I am a canine therapist.

341
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,370
<12-7,BARKER>如果让我治疗人的话就太疯狂了
<12-7,BARKER>Be pretty crazy for me to treat people.

342
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,320
<12-8,CASTLE>人  那就太疯狂了
<12-8,CASTLE>People? That would be crazy.

343
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,990
<12-9,BECKETT>贝克医生
<12-9,BECKETT>Uh, Dr. Bark--

344
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,530
<12-9,BECKETT>呃  贝克女士  罗亚尔最后一次来的时候
<12-9,BECKETT>Mrs. Barker, how did Francisco seem to you

345
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,180
<12-9,BECKETT>弗兰斯科看上去怎么样
<12-9,BECKETT>at Royal's last appointment?

346
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,160
<12-10,BARKER>实际上  他取消了
<12-10,BARKER>Well, actually, he canceled it.

347
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,870
<12-11,BECKETT>他有说为什么吗
<12-11,BECKETT>Did he say why?

348
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,080
<12-12,BARKER>只是说他突然有点事
<12-12,BARKER>Just that something had come up

349
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,730
<12-12,BARKER>他必须马上赶去个地方
<12-12,BARKER>and he had to be somewhere in a hurry.

350
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,250
<12-12,BARKER>好吧  这些
<12-12,BARKER>Okay, that's...

351
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,170
<12-13,BECKETT>实际上很有帮助
<12-13,BECKETT>actually helpful.

352
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,840
<12-15,BECKETT>那好  谢谢你
<12-15,BECKETT>Well... Well, um, thank you.

353
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,630
<12-15,BECKETT>如果还有其他事的话我们会联系你的
<12-15,BECKETT>We'll contact you if we need anything further.

354
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,170
<12-16,BARKER>罗亚尔现在怎么样了
<12-16,BARKER>How-- how is Royal doing?

355
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,320
<12-16,BARKER>他是不是真的在犯罪现场
<12-16,BARKER>Is it true that he was at the crime scene,

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,640
<12-16,BARKER>目睹了这场谋杀
<12-16,BARKER>that he witnessed the murder?

357
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,140
<12-17,CASTLE>是的  我们是这么认为的
<12-17,CASTLE>We think so, yes.

358
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,400
<12-18,BARKER>他也许看到了什么
<12-18,BARKER>There may be things he saw,

359
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,290
<12-18,BARKER>试图告诉我们关于凶杀的事情
<12-18,BARKER>things he's trying to communicate about the crime.

360
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,030
<12-18,BARKER>如果你能让我见他
<12-18,BARKER>If you let me see him,

361
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,460
<12-18,BARKER>我可以试着弄清楚他都知道什么
<12-18,BARKER>I can try to find out what he knows.

362
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,850
<12-19,CASTLE>要知道  弗兰斯科对她很有信心
<12-19,CASTLE>You know, Francisco had a lot of faith in her.

363
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,640
<12-19,CASTLE>也许值得花点时间
<12-19,CASTLE>Might be worth a few minutes.

364
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,450
<12-20,BECKETT>你的时间的话  没问题
<12-20,BECKETT>Of your time, sure.

365
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,580
<12-21,CASTLE>我去带他过来
<12-21,CASTLE>I'll get him.

367
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,800
<12-22,BECKETT>找到的狗粮足够罗亚尔吃上好一阵子的了
<12-22,BECKETT>Found enough dog food to keep Royal fat and happy for a while.

368
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,500
<12-23,RYAN>还找到了点别的东西
<12-23,RYAN>Found something else tasty, too.

369
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,930
<12-23,RYAN>电子窃听器扫描仪
<12-23,RYAN>Electronic bug sweeper.

370
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,500
<12-23,RYAN>看上去挺新的
<12-23,RYAN>Looks new.

371
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,090
<12-24,BECKETT>用来探测窃听设备的吗
<12-24,BECKETT>To detect eavesdropping devices?

372
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,310
<12-25,RYAN>不管他是不是疑神疑鬼
<12-25,RYAN>Paranoia or not,

373
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,700
<12-25,RYAN>弗兰斯科认为自己被人监视了
<12-25,RYAN>Francisco thought he was under surveillance.

374
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,640
<13-1,BECKETT>弗兰斯科担心他被窃听了
<13-1,BECKETT>Okay, so Francisco was worried that he was being bugged.

375
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,170
<13-1,BECKETT>还有昨天大概上午十点左右
<13-1,BECKETT>And then yesterday, somewhere around 11:00 AM,

376
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,760
<13-1,BECKETT>他突然出门  也是大约这个时段  凯的助手
<13-1,BECKETT>he runs off, right around the time that Kay's assistant

377
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,140
<13-1,BECKETT>说他变得疑神疑鬼的时候
<13-1,BECKETT>said that he started acting paranoid.

378
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,360
<13-2,ESPOSITO>几个小时之后  他就被谋杀了
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Then a few hours later, he's murdered.

379
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,370
<13-3,BECKETT>那么他到底去了哪里
<13-3,BECKETT>So then where the hell did he go?

380
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,900
<13-4,ESPOSITO>要知道  我们证物里有弗兰斯科的手机
<13-4,ESPOSITO>You know, we've got Francisco's cell phone in evidence.

381
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,050
<13-4,ESPOSITO>如果定位系统开着
<13-4,ESPOSITO>If the GPS was turned on,

382
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,990
<13-4,ESPOSITO>那么也许能告诉我们他去过哪里
<13-4,ESPOSITO>it might tell us exactly where he went.

383
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,920
<13-4,ESPOSITO>是啊  没错
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Yes, that's right.

384
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,090
<14-1,BARKER>我知道
<14-1,BARKER>I know.

385
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,060
<14-1,BARKER>我知道的
<14-1,BARKER>I know you are.

386
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,750
<14-2,BARKER>这个可怜的小家伙被吓坏了
<14-2,BARKER>Oh, the poor thing is just traumatized.

387
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,480
<14-2,BARKER>你们找到他的时候他是什么样的
<14-2,BARKER>How was he when you found him?

388
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,820
<14-3,CASTLE>他们说他在刨地
<14-3,CASTLE>Uh, they said that he was pawing at the ground.

389
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,700
<14-3,CASTLE>桑福尔的人说这是丧亲的表现
<14-3,CASTLE>Uh, the man from Sunfare said that was a sign of bereavement?

390
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,220
<14-4,BARKER>罗亚尔  罗亚尔
<14-4,BARKER>Royal, Royal,

391
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,630
<14-4,BARKER>看我在做什么
<14-4,BARKER>look at what I'm doing.

392
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,020
<14-4,BARKER>没错
<14-4,BARKER>That's right.

393
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,320
<14-5,BARKER>我就知道
<14-5,BARKER>I-I know it is.

394
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,870
<14-5,BARKER>他在试图告诉你一些东西
<14-5,BARKER>He was trying to tell you something,

395
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,720
<14-5,BARKER>很重要的东西
<14-5,BARKER>something important.

396
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,560
<14-6,CASTLE>真的吗  你这样就能看出来
<14-6,CASTLE>Really? You can tell all that from...

397
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,090
<14-7,BARKER>罗亚尔  看着我
<14-7,BARKER>Royal, look at me.

398
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,280
<14-7,BARKER>我知道  我知道你很伤心
<14-7,BARKER>I know. I know you're hurt.

399
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,890
<14-8,BARKER>你很疑惑
<14-8,BARKER>You're confused.

400
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,660
<14-8,BARKER>你在应对你的遗弃情结
<14-8,BARKER>You're dealing with abandonment issues.

401
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,960
<14-8,BARKER>还有很多问题需要解决
<14-8,BARKER>There's a lot to break through here.

402
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,930
<14-8,BARKER>这还需要点时间
<14-8,BARKER>This could take some time.

403
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,270
<14-9,CASTLE>告诉我
<14-9,CASTLE>Tell me...

404
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,470
<14-9,CASTLE>弗兰斯科有没有看过你治疗的过程
<14-9,CASTLE>did Francisco ever observe you during your sessions?

405
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,650
<14-10,BARKER>没有  他都在外面等着  怎么了
<14-10,BARKER>No. He waited outside. Why?

406
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,790
<14-11,CASTLE>没什么
<14-11,CASTLE>No reason.

407
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,050
<15-1,ESPOSITO>根据他的手机显示
<15-1,ESPOSITO>According to his phone,

408
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,330
<15-1,ESPOSITO>这里是昨天弗兰斯科在选秀开始之前
<15-1,ESPOSITO>this is the place Francisco went yesterday

409
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,940
<15-1,ESPOSITO>去的地方
<15-1,ESPOSITO>before the dog show.

410
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,830
<15-1,ESPOSITO>也许是和他的赌博联系人见面
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Maybe it was to meet his gambling contacts.

411
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,620
<15-2,BECKETT>不能在电话里解决吗
<15-2,BECKETT>Couldn't he just do this over the phone?

412
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,240
<15-3,ESPOSITO>要是他被窃听了的话就不行
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Not if he was being bugged.

413
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,570
<15-3,ESPOSITO>记得弗兰斯科口袋里还有样什么东西吗
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Remember what else Francisco had in his pocket?

415
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,070
<15-3,ESPOSITO>这是什么地方
<15-3,ESPOSITO>What is this place?

416
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,750
<16-1,ESPOSITO>看上去像是个狗舍
<16-1,ESPOSITO>It looks like some kind of a kennel.

417
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,440
<16-2,BECKETT>是的  我看到了笼子
<16-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I see the... cages.

418
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,450
<16-3,ESPOSITO>但是  怎么没有
<16-3,ESPOSITO>But where are the...

419
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,550
<16-4,ESPOSITO>看门狗
<16-4,ESPOSITO>shepherds.

420
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,310
<16-5,ESPOSITO>听好了
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Okay, listen,

421
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,370
<16-5,ESPOSITO>我的一个朋友以前养过一只这个
<16-5,ESPOSITO>a friend of mine had one of these.

422
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,350
<16-5,ESPOSITO>他们能闻出恐惧
<16-5,ESPOSITO>They smell fear.

423
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,320
<16-5,ESPOSITO>所以不要害怕
<16-5,ESPOSITO>So don't flinch.

424
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,130
<16-5,ESPOSITO>无论如何  都不要
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Whatever you do, don't...

425
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,770
<16-6,ESPOSITO>跑

<17-4,JACK PATTERSON>What the hell are you doing in my warehouse?!

<17-9,BECKETT>我们在调查他的凶杀案
<17-9,BECKETT>We're investigating his murder.

438
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,450
<17-9,BECKETT>这里到底是什么地方
<17-9,BECKETT>What the hell is this place?

439
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
<18-1,PATTERSON>弗兰斯科正在饲养一个新的狗品种
<18-1,PATTERSON>Francisco was breeding a new type of designer dog--

<18-1,PATTERSON>真是个悲剧
<18-1,PATTERSON>It's a real tragedy.

443
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,350
<18-1,PATTERSON>那家伙一辈子都用在研发新的狗品种上了
<18-1,PATTERSON>Guy spends his whole life developing a dog.

444
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,770
<18-1,PATTERSON>他本来都要把结果公之于众了
<18-1,PATTERSON>He was almost ready to unveil it, too.

445
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,360
<18-2,BECKETT>你有多了解弗兰斯科
<18-2,BECKETT>How well did you know Francisco?

446
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,900
<18-3,ESPOSITO>是的  他有没有赌博的癖好
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, did he have a gambling hobby,

447
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,910
<18-3,ESPOSITO>他有没有可能从不该惹的人手里收了贿赂
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Possibly took some bribes from the wrong people?

448
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,470
<18-4,PATTERSON>弗兰斯科没有任何癖好
<18-4,PATTERSON>Francisco didn't have hobbies.

449
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,220
<18-4,PATTERSON>他把一生的心血都献给了工作
<18-4,PATTERSON>His whole life was his work,

450
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,680
<18-4,PATTERSON>诚实的工作
<18-4,PATTERSON>and it was honest work.

451
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,480
<18-5,ESPOSITO>好吧  事情是这样的
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, the thing is,

452
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,820
<18-5,ESPOSITO>弗兰斯科往一个账号里存了好几大笔钱
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Francisco made a bunch of major cash deposits into an account.

453
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,620
<18-6,PATTERSON>让我猜猜  一次一万  是不是
<18-6,PATTERSON>Let me guess. 10 grand each, right?

454
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,550
<18-6,PATTERSON>普拉尔寻回犬的消息走漏了出去
<18-6,PATTERSON>Word was leaking out about the Pilar Retriever.

455
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,440
<18-6,PATTERSON>人们会在选秀上找到弗兰斯科
<18-6,PATTERSON>People were stopping Francisco at dog shows,

456
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,190
<18-6,PATTERSON>给他现金  就为了预订一只首窝的小狗
<18-6,PATTERSON>giving him cash just to reserve a pup from the first litter.

457
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,420
<18-7,BECKETT>你知道他昨天为什么要赶过来吗
<18-7,BECKETT>Any idea why he rushed over here yesterday?

458
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,310
<18-8,PATTERSON>事实上是的
<18-8,PATTERSON>Actually, yeah.

459
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,430
<18-8,PATTERSON>他带着一个窃听器扫描仪到这里来到处检查
<18-8,PATTERSON>He showed up with a bug detector and started sweeping the place.

460
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,320
<18-9,BECKETT>为什么有人要监视一个狗舍呢
<18-9,BECKETT>Why would anyone want to put a kennel under surveillance?

461
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,860
<18-10,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<18-10,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

462
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,600
<18-11,PATTERSON>其实他的饲养和训练方法
<18-11,PATTERSON>Well, his breeding and training methods

463
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,900
<18-11,PATTERSON>都是高级机密
<18-11,PATTERSON>were closely guarded secrets,

464
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,430
<18-11,PATTERSON>而普拉尔寻回犬让他的对手们
<18-11,PATTERSON>and the Pilar Retriever was making his competitors

465
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,630
<18-11,PATTERSON>非常紧张
<18-11,PATTERSON>very nervous.

466
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,140
<18-12,BECKETT>有什么具体的人吗
<18-12,BECKETT>Anyone specific?

467
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,350
<18-13,PATTERSON>那时听上去有点疯狂
<18-13,PATTERSON>It sounded crazy at the time,

468
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,240
<18-13,PATTERSON>但他认为一位托他训狗的客户在和
<18-13,PATTERSON>but he thought one of his dog training clients was in business

469
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,980
<18-13,PATTERSON>一个试图渗透我们生意的人做交易
<18-13,PATTERSON>with someone who was trying to infiltrate our operation.

470
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,140
<18-14,BECKETT>他跟你说是哪位客户了吗
<18-14,BECKETT>And did he tell you which client?

471
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,550
<18-14,BECKETT>凯·卡普奇诺
<18-14,BECKETT>Kay Cappuccio?

472
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,440
<19-1,CASTLE>她为什么要窃取弗兰斯科的秘方
<19-1,CASTLE>Why would she steal Francisco's secrets?

473
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,750
<19-2,BECKETT>我们不能肯定她确实这么做了
<19-2,BECKETT>Well, we don't know for sure that she did.

474
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,930
<19-2,BECKETT>实际上  我们不知道他是不是真被人窃听
<19-2,BECKETT>In fact, we don't know that he was actually bugged by anyone.

475
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,410
<19-3,RYAN>我们现在知道了
<19-3,RYAN>Well, we do now.

476
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,340
<19-3,RYAN>弗兰斯科的扫描仪是有储存器的
<19-3,RYAN>Francisco's sweeper has a memory,

477
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,500
<19-3,RYAN>它昨天早晨曾发现过监听设备
<19-3,RYAN>and it tripped to a listening device yesterday morning.

478
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,370
<19-4,CASTLE>那是他去找凯的人
<19-4,CASTLE>The same time he confronted Kay's people

479
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,880
<19-4,CASTLE>问她在为谁卖命的时间段
<19-4,CASTLE>and asked who she was working for.

480
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,090
<19-4,CASTLE>这不会只是巧合
<19-4,CASTLE>This can't be a coincidence.

481
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,850
<19-4,CASTLE>这一切都发生在他被杀当日
<19-4,CASTLE>It all happened on the same day he was killed.

482
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,780
<19-5,BECKETT>知道吗  我觉得凯·卡普奇诺知道的
<19-5,BECKETT>You know, I got a feeling that Kay Cappuccio

483
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,530
<19-5,BECKETT>比她说出来的要多
<19-5,BECKETT>knows a lot more than she's letting on.

484
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,250
<19-5,BECKETT>我们还得找她谈谈
<19-5,BECKETT>We're gonna have to talk to her again.

485
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,620
<19-5,BECKETT>这一次...
<19-5,BECKETT>And this time...

486
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,600
<19-5,BECKETT>她得来我们这儿
<19-5,BECKETT>She's coming to us.

487
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,480
<20-1,BECKETT>卡普奇诺小姐  这边走
<20-1,BECKETT>Right this way, Ms. Cappuccio.

488
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,600
<20-2,BECKETT>你们留步
<20-2,BECKETT>Just her.

489
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,310
<20-2,BECKETT>我其实不看真人秀节目  卡普奇诺小姐
<20-2,BECKETT>I don't really watch reality television, Ms. Cappuccio.

490
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,810
<20-2,BECKETT>你想知道那是为什么吗
<20-2,BECKETT>Would you like to know why?

491
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,110
<21-1,BECKETT>想亲亲吗
<21-1,BECKETT>You want kisses?

492
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,460
<21-2,KAY>亲亲
<21-2,KAY>Kisses.

493
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,550
<21-3,BECKETT>因为我通常发现节目不全是真的
<21-3,BECKETT>Because I usually find that it's not all that real.

494
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,510
<21-3,BECKETT>而我不喜欢把故事当做
<21-3,BECKETT>And I don't like things or people

495
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,670
<21-3,BECKETT>真事呈现的人或节目
<21-3,BECKETT>who present fiction as truth.

496
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,430
<21-3,BECKETT>实际上  我觉得那就是浪费时间
<21-3,BECKETT>In fact, I find it to be a waste of time.

497
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,290
<21-4,KAY>好吧  你叫我来就是为了这个吗
<21-4,KAY>OKay, is this why you brought me down here,

498
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,580
<21-4,KAY>侮辱我的节目
<21-4,KAY>to insult my show?

499
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,670
<21-5,BECKETT>不是为了你的节目
<21-5,BECKETT>This isn't about your show.

500
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,970
<21-5,BECKETT>我想知道你跟弗兰斯科到底发生了什么事
<21-5,BECKETT>I want to know what really happened with Francisco.

501
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,430
<21-5,BECKETT>这次讲真话
<21-5,BECKETT>This time, the truth.

502
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,890
<21-6,KAY>我跟你说的就是真话
<21-6,KAY>I told you the truth.

503
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,640
<21-7,BECKETT>你的助理说
<21-7,BECKETT>Well, according to your assistant,

504
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,330
<21-7,BECKETT>弗兰斯科问你你在为谁卖命
<21-7,BECKETT>Francisco asked you who you were working for.

505
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,160
<21-7,BECKETT>这话什么意思
<21-7,BECKETT>What does that mean?

506
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,620
<21-8,KAY>我说了  我不知道
<21-8,KAY>I told you, I have no idea.

507
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,850
<21-8,KAY>真的吗
<21-8,KAY>Really?

508
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,210
<21-9,CASTLE>完全不知道他正在建立一家育狗机构
<21-9,CASTLE>No idea that he was starting a breeding venture

509
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,770
<21-9,CASTLE>而他的竞争对手急切地想了解此事
<21-9,CASTLE>that his competitors were just dying to know about?

510
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,510
<21-9,CASTLE>告诉我  "商业间谍"这个词
<21-9,CASTLE>Tell me, does the phrase "corporate espionage"

511
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,480
<21-9,CASTLE>你了解吗
<21-9,CASTLE>mean anything to you?

512
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,660
<21-10,KAY>不
<21-10,KAY>No.

513
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,220
<21-11,KAY>说真的  我不知道那是什么意思
<21-11,KAY>No, seriously. I have no idea what it means.

514
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,270
<21-12,RYAN>能跟你们谈一下吗
<21-12,RYAN>Could I, uh, see you guys for a second?

515
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,590
<22-1,RYAN>扫描仪对她有反应
<22-1,RYAN>She set off the sweeper.

516
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,420
<22-2,BECKETT>什么
<22-2,BECKETT>What?

517
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,100
<22-3,RYAN>刚刚窃听器扫描仪就放在我桌上
<22-3,RYAN>The bug sweeper was on my desk.

518
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,130
<22-3,RYAN>她走过的时候  扫描仪响了
<22-3,RYAN>When she walked by, it went off.

519
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,700
<22-4,CASTLE>你认为她身上有窃听器吗
<22-4,CASTLE>You think she's wearing a wire?

520
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,630
<22-5,ESPOSITO>哥们  你看看她穿的衣服
<22-5,ESPOSITO>Dude, look at that outfit.

521
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,900
<22-5,ESPOSITO>她要往哪放窃听器啊
<22-5,ESPOSITO>Where is she gonna put a wire?

522
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,660
<22-6,CASTLE>如果我发挥想象力  我会猜...
<22-6,CASTLE>Well, if I had to be creative, I'd guess--

523
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,940
<22-6,CASTLE>我只是夸张而已
<22-6,CASTLE>That's rhetorical.

524
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,650
<22-7,RYAN>我们去技术室
<22-7,RYAN>We went into the tech room

525
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,960
<22-7,RYAN>分离窃听器发送信号的频率
<22-7,RYAN>to isolate the frequency that the bug was transmitting on,

526
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,410
<22-7,RYAN>我们发现了...
<22-7,RYAN>and we found, uh, well...

527
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,440
<22-8,ESPOSITO>给他们看看
<22-8,ESPOSITO>Show 'em.

528
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,560
<22-8,ESPOSITO>好吧
<22-8,ESPOSITO>All right.

529
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,160
<22-9,KAY>好宝宝
<22-9,KAY>Oh, sweet baby.

530
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,430
<22-9,KAY>妈妈马上就送你回家
<22-9,KAY>Mommy's gonna get you home so soon.

531
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,180
<22-11,ESPOSITO>胸部
<22-11,ESPOSITO>Boobs?

532
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,760
<22-11,ESPOSITO>可不是一般的胸  是她的胸
<22-11,ESPOSITO>Not just any boobs, her boobs.

533
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,350
<22-12,CASTLE>放在狗项圈上了
<22-12,CASTLE>It's on the collar.

534
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,890
<22-12,CASTLE>狗的项圈的其中一块宝石里面有摄像头
<22-12,CASTLE>There's a camera in one of the jewels in the dog's collar.

535
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,750
<22-12,CASTLE>你说她无论去哪都带着她的狗
<22-12,CASTLE>You said she takes that dog with her wherever she goes?

536
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,740
<22-14,BECKETT>就是说弗兰斯科
<22-14,BECKETT>Which means that Francisco

537
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,670
<22-14,BECKETT>可能不是受到监控的对象
<22-14,BECKETT>probably wasn't the intended target of the surveillance.

538
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,220
<22-15,CASTLE>凯·卡普奇诺才是
<22-15,CASTLE>Kay Cappuccio is.

539
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,310
<23-1,KAY>真不敢相信有人一直在监视我
<23-1,KAY>I cannot believe that someone has been watching me.

540
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,260
<23-2,CASTLE>卡普奇诺小姐  你说你的狗
<23-2,CASTLE>Ms. Cappuccio, when you say that your dog

541
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,340
<23-2,CASTLE>你去哪都会带上
<23-2,CASTLE>goes with you everywhere--

542
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,350
<23-2,CASTLE>我的天啊
<23-2,CASTLE>Oh, my god.

543
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,310
<23-3,KAY>他可能看到了我出浴
<23-3,KAY>He could've seen me in the shower.

544
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,730
<23-3,KAY>他可能看到了我和雷吉在床上
<23-3,KAY>He could have seen me and Reggie in bed together.

545
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,310
<23-3,KAY>他可能看到了我没化妆的样子
<23-3,KAY>He could've seen me without my makeup.

546
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,910
<23-4,KAY>我觉得好受侵犯
<23-4,KAY>I feel so violated.

547
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,620
<23-5,BECKETT>听我说  狗仔队虽然咄咄逼人
<23-5,BECKETT>Look, the paparazzi are aggressive,

548
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,290
<23-5,BECKETT>但是在狗项圈上装监视器
<23-5,BECKETT>but wiring a dog collar,

549
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,090
<23-5,BECKETT>这可要费不少功夫啊
<23-5,BECKETT>that's a lot of effort to go through

550
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,610
<23-5,BECKETT>就为拿到明星录影带吗
<23-5,BECKETT>just to get some celebrity video.

551
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,620
<23-6,KAY>可是  这可不是一般的明星录影带啊
<23-6,KAY>Oh, well, I mean, it's not just any celebrity video.

552
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,700
<23-6,KAY>美国名人消息网  悬赏好像有一百万
<23-6,KAY>I mean, T.M.Z.'s offered, like, a million bucks

553
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,170
<23-6,KAY>要买我的首张裸照
<23-6,KAY>for the first naked picture of me.

554
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,300
<23-7,ESPOSITO>要我说  这数目还太低呢
<23-7,ESPOSITO>You ask me, that number's on the low side.

555
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,490
<23-8,KAY>你嘴真是太甜了
<23-8,KAY>You are too sweet.

556
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,640
<23-9,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<23-9,ESPOSITO>Thank you.

557
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,620
<23-10,RYAN>一百万可是很强大的动机
<23-10,RYAN>A million dollars is a pretty powerful incentive.

558
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,830
<23-11,KAY>是啊
<23-11,KAY>Yeah.

559
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,390
<23-12,BECKETT>你什么时候买的那个项圈
<23-12,BECKETT>When did you get that collar?

560
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,070
<23-13,KAY>几周前
<23-13,KAY>Um, a few weeks ago.

561
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,090
<23-14,CASTLE>摄像头只能是那之后安装上的
<23-14,CASTLE>The camera would've had to be installed since then,

562
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,070
<23-14,CASTLE>就是说安装的人能接触到你的狗
<23-14,CASTLE>which would mean they would need access to your dog.

563
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,680
<23-15,KAY>洛丽塔几乎与我寸步不离
<23-15,KAY>Lolita is barely ever out of my sight.

564
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,930
<23-15,KAY>除了她出去散步
<23-15,KAY>Only when she goes on her walk

565
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,200
<23-15,KAY>或者去做动物美容时
<23-15,KAY>or to the groomer's.

566
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,910
<23-16,BECKETT>好吧  我们需要所有那些人的名字
<23-16,BECKETT>Okay, we're gonna need the names of all of those people

567
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,000
<23-16,BECKETT>还有你家里的雇员名单
<23-16,BECKETT>along with your house staff.

568
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,310
<23-16,BECKETT>我们需要对他们所有人做背景调查
<23-16,BECKETT>We're gonna want to run background checks on all of them.

569
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,620
<23-18,CASTLE>在此期间  我们该让摄像头继续工作
<23-18,CASTLE>In the meantime, we should keep the collar-cam active.

570
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,420
<23-18,CASTLE>我们可不想让幕后黑手知道我们查到他们身上了
<23-18,CASTLE>We don't want whoever's behind this to know we're on to them.

571
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,500
<23-19,BECKETT>没错  所以你该做什么还做什么
<23-19,BECKETT>Right, which means, just go about your regular routine.

572
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,240
<23-20,CASTLE>就尽量把你的隐私
<23-20,CASTLE>Just try to keep your private moments...

573
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,440
<23-20,CASTLE>保护好
<23-20,CASTLE>more private.

574
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,390
<24-1,BECKETT>如果凯才是真正的监控对象
<24-1,BECKETT>Look, if Kay was the actual target of the surveillance,

575
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,380
<24-1,BECKETT>这一切又跟弗兰斯科的被杀有什么关系呢
<24-1,BECKETT>What does any of this have to do with Francisco's murder?

576
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,990
<24-1,BECKETT>如果...
<24-1,BECKETT>What if...

577
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,070
<24-2,CASTLE>弗兰斯科发现了项圈被动过手脚
<24-2,CASTLE>Francisco discovers the collar is rigged,

578
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,910
<24-2,CASTLE>他把狗还给了凯  但他当时
<24-2,CASTLE>He returns the dog to Kay, but doesn't get a chance

579
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,790
<24-2,CASTLE>没来得及与她对质
<24-2,CASTLE>to confront her about it at the time,

580
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,860
<24-2,CASTLE>但是那个在监控这着画面的人
<24-2,CASTLE>but whoever's monitoring the feed

581
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,210
<24-2,CASTLE>本想看到她一丝不挂的样子
<24-2,CASTLE>hoping to see her naked

582
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,580
<24-2,CASTLE>却听到凯说选秀结束后她要去跟
<24-2,CASTLE>hears Kay say that she intends to talk to Francisco

583
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,390
<24-2,CASTLE>弗兰斯科谈谈
<24-2,CASTLE>after the show?

584
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,440
<24-3,BECKETT>所以他们为了封口而杀人吗
<24-3,BECKETT>So then they killed him to keep him quiet?

585
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,270
<24-4,ESPOSITO>我们是在说狗仔队
<24-4,ESPOSITO>Well, this is paparazzi we're talking about.

586
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,710
<24-4,ESPOSITO>我觉得那些人渣为了一笔大钱而动杀机不无可能
<24-4,ESPOSITO>I could see one of those scum killing for a fat paycheck.

587
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,010
<24-5,BECKETT>那么我们如果能找出给项圈装监视器的人
<24-5,BECKETT>So if we find whoever bugged that collar,

588
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,990
<24-5,BECKETT>或许就能找到凶手
<24-5,BECKETT>then we might be able to find our killer.

589
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,460
<24-6,CASTLE>我们可以翻看一下凯最近的照片
<24-6,CASTLE>Well, we could go through recent photos of Kay,

590
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,480
<24-6,CASTLE>就是刊登在小报  八卦网站上的照片
<24-6,CASTLE>you know, from tabloids, gossip web sites,

591
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,270
<24-6,CASTLE>看看她能不能认出哪张
<24-6,CASTLE>and see if she can identify any of them

592
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,620
<24-6,CASTLE>是项圈摄像头拍下来的
<24-6,CASTLE>as being from the collar-cam.

593
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,840
<24-7,BECKETT>那样或许能顺藤摸瓜
<24-7,BECKETT>And then there might be a trail

594
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,160
<24-7,BECKETT>找到安摄像头的人
<24-7,BECKETT>that leads back to the guilty party.

595
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
<24-7,BECKETT>那么我们得找个人
<24-7,BECKETT>So we're gonna have to find somebody

596
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,150
<24-7,BECKETT>-去把照片翻出来  -我去吧
<24-7,BECKETT>- to pull all those photos- - I'll do it.

597
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,430
<24-9,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  你是情窦初开了吗
<24-9,CASTLE>Got a little case of, uh, puppy love there, Esposito?

598
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,570
<24-10,BECKETT>你知道她有个很正式的男友吧
<24-10,BECKETT>You do realize that she's got a serious boyfriend, right?

599
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,710
<24-11,ESPOSITO>谁  雷吉吗
<24-11,ESPOSITO>Who... Reggie?

600
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,620
<24-11,ESPOSITO>他就是健身操录影带里的替补舞者
<24-11,ESPOSITO>He was a back-up dancer in a fitness video.

601
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,160
<24-11,ESPOSITO>我是说  我都不知道
<24-11,ESPOSITO>I mean, I don't even know

602
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,180
<24-11,ESPOSITO>她跟那种蠢蛋在一起干嘛
<24-11,ESPOSITO>what she's doing with that knucklehead.

603
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,960
<24-11,ESPOSITO>算了
<24-11,ESPOSITO>No.

604
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,560
<24-12,CASTLE>看来埃斯波西托
<24-12,CASTLE>Aw. Looks like Esposito...

605
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,230
<24-12,CASTLE>不是分局里唯一受挫的
<24-12,CASTLE>isn't the only frustrated dog in the precinct.

606
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,280
<24-12,CASTLE>谁把他锁在里面了
<24-12,CASTLE>Who closed him up in there?

607
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,550
<24-13,BECKETT>他得睡一觉
<24-13,BECKETT>Oh, he needed to take a nap,

608
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,500
<24-13,BECKETT>但他不能在这儿过夜
<24-13,BECKETT>but he can't stay there overnight.

609
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,380
<24-14,CASTLE>我可能带他回我家
<24-14,CASTLE>I could take him home with me.

610
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,130
<24-14,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯这周末不在  我正好缺个伴儿
<24-14,CASTLE>Alexis is gone for the weekend, and I could use the company.

611
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,580
<24-15,BECKETT>要不  我也可以带他回家啊
<24-15,BECKETT>Or... I could take him home.

612
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,770
<24-15,BECKETT>我在考虑养狗的事
<24-15,BECKETT>I mean, I've been thinking about getting a dog.

613
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,850
<24-15,BECKETT>这或许正是试一下的好机会
<24-15,BECKETT>This might be a great chance at a trial run.

614
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,360
<24-16,CASTLE>好吧  那我想你可以带他回家
<24-16,CASTLE>Yeah. All right. Then I guess you can take him.

615
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,430
<24-17,BECKETT>我是说...
<24-17,BECKETT>I mean, I--

616
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,160
<24-17,BECKETT>我是说我不想让你感觉孤苦伶仃的
<24-17,BECKETT>I mean, I don't--I don't want you to feel lonely.

617
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,510
<24-18,CASTLE>可以掷硬币
<24-18,CASTLE>I could flip for it.

618
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,810
<24-19,BECKETT>不玩石头剪子布吗
<24-19,BECKETT>No Roshambo?

619
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,120
<24-20,CASTLE>那样对你不公平啊
<24-20,CASTLE>Well, I mean, that would put you at an unfair disadvantage.

620
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,080
<41-21,CASTLE>我这么厉害
<41-21,CASTLE>I'm pretty good--

621
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,820
<41-22,BECKETT>-来吧  卡塞尔  来吧  -好吧
<41-22,BECKETT>- Oh, come on, Castle. Let's go. - All right.

622
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,390
<24-23,CASTLE>你要知道  玩这个是有策略的
<24-23,CASTLE>Just so you know, there's strategies in this game that, uh...

623
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,440
<24-24,BECKETT>-三局两胜  -好
<24-24,BECKETT>- Two out of three? - Mm-hmm.

624
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,120
<24-25,CASTLE>五局三胜
<24-25,CASTLE>Three out of five?

625
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,240
<24-26,BECKETT>行
<24-26,BECKETT>Sure.

626
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,630
<24-27,BECKETT>这事我们还有另一种解决方案
<24-27,BECKETT>You know, there is another way that we can go about this.

627
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,530
<25-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你该在一个小时前送它来的
<25-1,BECKETT>Castle, you were supposed to be here over an hour ago.

628
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,640
<25-1,BECKETT>我们这是"共享"监护
<25-1,BECKETT>It's called "shared" custody,

629
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,610
<25-1,BECKETT>不是"想出现就出现"监护
<25-1,BECKETT>not "show up when you want" custody.

630
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,630
<25-2,CASTLE>话是没错  我原本以为东西带全了
<25-2,CASTLE>Yeah, I thought I had everything together,

631
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,280
<25-2,CASTLE>但是最后一刻我才发现找不到呱呱叫先生了
<25-2,CASTLE>but at the last minute, I could not find Mr. Squeaky.

632
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,440
<25-3,CASTLE>别担心要喂它什么
<25-3,CASTLE>So don't worry about feeding him.

633
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,290
<25-3,CASTLE>我喂了它一块没吃完的牛腓利
<25-3,CASTLE>I had a rib eye I couldn't finish.

634
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,560
<25-4,BECKETT>你给它吃牛排
<25-4,BECKETT>You fed him a steak?

635
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,060
<25-5,CASTLE>是啊  别担心  我们饭后运动了
<25-5,CASTLE>Yeah. Don't worry. We worked it off.

636
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,640
<25-5,CASTLE>它在客厅玩了扔玩具
<25-5,CASTLE>He played, uh, fetch in the hall,

637
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,140
<25-5,CASTLE>然后我们还一起看了《比佛利拜金狗》
<25-5,CASTLE>and then we watched some "Beverly Hills Chihuahua."

638
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,640
<25-5,CASTLE>天啊  这家伙
<25-5,CASTLE>Boy, this guy--

639
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,410
<25-5,CASTLE>这家伙超爱抱抱
<25-5,CASTLE>This guy is a snuggler.

640
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,940
<25-6,BECKETT>我敢说你让它坐在沙发上了  是吗
<25-6,BECKETT>And I bet you let him sit on your couch, didn't you?

641
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,120
<25-7,CASTLE>不要紧  你做了有趣搞怪的一方
<25-7,CASTLE>No, it's okay. You can be the fun one.

642
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,350
<25-8,BECKETT>我就做严厉刻板的一方
<25-8,BECKETT>I'll just be the bad guy,

643
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,030
<25-8,BECKETT>因为你绝对不可以把我的沙发
<25-8,BECKETT>because there is no way that you are shedding

644
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,250
<25-8,BECKETT>弄得都是毛
<25-8,BECKETT>all over my couch.

645
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,200
<25-9,CASTLE>没关系  他待在那里也很舒服
<25-9,CASTLE>Oh, no. He's perfectly happy right there.

646
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,280
<25-9,CASTLE>还有它最喜欢你轻揉它双眼之间
<25-9,CASTLE>Oh, and he loves it when you rub him right between the eyes.

647
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,340
<25-9,CASTLE>用大拇指轻轻绕圈  像这样
<25-9,CASTLE>Just little circles with your thumb, just like this.

648
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,810
<25-9,CASTLE>不要太用力  只要
<25-9,CASTLE>Not too hard, just...

649
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,940
<25-11,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -就这样  你懂的
<25-11,CASTLE>- Castle-- - Yeah, there's... you get it.

<25-12,CASTLE>Yeah. Um, all right.

<25-12,CASTLE>You guys have fun.

652

<25-12,CASTLE>别太想我哦
<25-12,CASTLE>Don't miss me too much.

653
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,310
<25-12,CASTLE>我跟它说  不是你
<25-12,CASTLE>The dog, not you.

654
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,040
<25-12,CASTLE>好吧  上来
<25-12,CASTLE>Okay, come on.

<25-13,BECKETT>来吧  来吧
<25-13,BECKETT>Come on. Right here.

657
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,610
<25-14,BECKETT>好啦  你太可爱了
<25-14,BECKETT>Come on. You're so cute.

658
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,200
<25-14,BECKETT>我从没想过我会这么说
<25-14,BECKETT>I never thought I would say this,

659
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,170
<26-1,KAY>但是我现在真是看够我自己了
<26-1,KAY>but I am so sick of looking at myself right now.

660
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,660
<26-1,KAY>我都没法想象你的感受
<26-1,KAY>I can't even imagine how you must feel.

661
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,280
<26-2,ESPOSITO>别担心我
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Don't worry about me.

662
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,680
<26-3,ESPOSITO>那么
<26-3,ESPOSITO>What about...

663
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,670
<26-3,ESPOSITO>那张呢
<26-3,ESPOSITO>that one?

664
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,450
<26-4,KAY>那是我周四穿的
<26-4,KAY>Um, that is what I wore on Thursday.

665
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,890
<26-4,KAY>也就是说洛丽塔在清洗店  所以  不是
<26-4,KAY>So that means Lolita was off at the Groomer's, so, no.

666
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,780
<26-4,KAY>这张照片不可能是从项圈的摄像机拍的
<26-4,KAY>The collar couldn't have taken this picture.

667
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,260
<26-5,ESPOSITO>我真不敢相信你只从
<26-5,ESPOSITO>I can't believe you can identify

668
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,420
<26-5,ESPOSITO>穿着的衣服就能分辨那是哪一天
<26-5,ESPOSITO>what day of the year it is just from what you're wearing.

669
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,200
<26-6,KAY>而大家偏偏说我没有才华
<26-6,KAY>And people say I'm talentless.

670
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,240
<26-7,ESPOSITO>别理会那些心存愤恨的人
<26-7,ESPOSITO>Don't listen to those haters.

671
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,920
<26-7,ESPOSITO>他们有多少人能说他们有自己的化妆品品牌
<26-7,ESPOSITO>How many of them can say they got their own cosmetics line, huh?

672
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,900
<26-8,ESPOSITO>这张呢
<26-8,ESPOSITO>How about this one?

673
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,790
<26-9,KAY>哦不  上帝啊  我记得那天
<26-9,KAY>No. God. I remember that day.

674
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,010
<26-9,KAY>有个怪吓人的摄影师
<26-9,KAY>There was this creep photographer

675
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,120
<26-9,KAY>藏在两辆车中间
<26-9,KAY>hidden down between two cars.

676
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,760
<26-10,KAY>这真让人抑郁
<26-10,KAY>This is depressing.

677
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,090
<26-11,ESPOSITO>别担心  我们会抓住这家伙的
<26-11,ESPOSITO>Don't worry. We'll catch the guy.

678
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,120
<26-12,KAY>不是  我是说我的生活  就是
<26-12,KAY>No, I mean, my life. It's...

679
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,840
<26-12,KAY>购物
<26-12,KAY>shopping

680
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,400
<26-12,KAY>开派对  再购物
<26-12,KAY>and partying and more shopping.

681
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,810
<26-12,KAY>人们争着拍我做着这些蠢事
<26-12,KAY>And it is bad enough that people fight to take pictures of me

682
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,260
<26-12,KAY>就已经够糟糕了  但是
<26-12,KAY>doing all this dumb stuff, but...

683
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,470
<26-12,KAY>你真的觉得弗兰斯科
<26-12,KAY>Do you really think that Francisco

684
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
<26-12,KAY>是因为这个才被谋杀的吗
<26-12,KAY>was murdered because of it?

685
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,840
<26-13,ESPOSITO>就算是
<26-13,ESPOSITO>Well, if he was,

686
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,370
<26-13,ESPOSITO>也不是你的错
<26-13,ESPOSITO>it doesn't make it your fault.

687
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,470
<26-14,KAY>他有家人吗
<26-14,KAY>Did he have a family?

688
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,850
<26-14,KAY>没有
<26-14,KAY>No.

689
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,510
<26-15,ESPOSITO>他和狗相依为命
<26-15,ESPOSITO>It was just him and his dog.

690
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,330
<26-16,KAY>那样  我想我们没什么区别
<26-16,KAY>Oh, well, I guess we weren't so different then.

691
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,130
<26-16,KAY>你说什么呢
<26-16,KAY>What are you talking about?

692
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,270
<26-17,ESPOSITO>你  你有雷吉
<26-17,ESPOSITO>You, uh, well, you have... Reggie,

693
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,270
<26-17,ESPOSITO>菲比  还有很多朋友
<26-17,ESPOSITO>Phoebe, all your friends.

694
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,500
<26-17,ESPOSITO>看看这些照片
<26-17,ESPOSITO>Look at all these pictures.

695
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,900
<26-17,ESPOSITO>你从未落单
<26-17,ESPOSITO>You're never alone.

696
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,300
<26-18,KAY>照片真的很能骗人
<26-18,KAY>Pictures can be really deceiving.

697
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,080
<26-19,KAY>等等
<26-19,KAY>Wait.

698
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,730
<26-20,ESPOSITO>-这张  -这张
<26-20,ESPOSITO>- This one. - This one?

699
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,900
<26-20,ESPOSITO>这是从高角度拍的
<26-20,ESPOSITO>It's from a high angle.

700
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,520
<26-21,KAY>不不  这是上周拍的
<26-21,KAY>No, no, this is from last week.

701
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,900
<26-21,KAY>这天洛丽塔没栓皮带
<26-21,KAY>This is the day that Lolita got off her leash,

702
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,970
<26-21,KAY>她爬上了这座山
<26-21,KAY>and she climbed up this hill,

703
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,030
<26-21,KAY>她可能刚好在这个高点
<26-21,KAY>and this would've been her exact vantage point.

704
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,600
<26-22,ESPOSITO>现在我只要打给《明星特报》
<26-22,ESPOSITO>Now all I gotta do is call "Celebrity Report,"

705
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,130
<26-22,ESPOSITO>通过他们应该可以助我找到...
<26-22,ESPOSITO>and they oughta lead me right to...

706
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,060
<27-1,ESPOSITO>马库斯·怀特
<27-1,ESPOSITO>Marcus Hiatt.

707
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
<27-1,ESPOSITO>所有被确认是从项圈摄像机拍摄的照片
<27-1,ESPOSITO>All the pictures IDed from the collar-cam

708
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,260
<27-1,ESPOSITO>都能反查到他身上
<27-1,ESPOSITO>can be traced back to him.

709
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,510
<27-2,CASTLE>他和其他狗仔队一起守在凯家门外
<27-2,CASTLE>He was outside Kay's place with the rest of the paparazzi.

710
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,200
<27-3,ESPOSITO>他可是个变态跟踪狗仔
<27-3,ESPOSITO>The guy's a full-on stalkerazzi.

711
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,210
<27-3,ESPOSITO>骚扰  非法入侵  甚至是破门而入
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Harassment, trespassing, even B&E--

712
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,650
<27-3,ESPOSITO>看起来这家伙为了获得高价照片
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Seems like there's nothing this guy won't do

713
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,990
<27-3,ESPOSITO>会不惜一切代价
<27-3,ESPOSITO>to get that big-money shot.

714
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,470
<27-3,ESPOSITO>而且我们知道他有犯案的机会
<27-3,ESPOSITO>And we know he had opportunity for the murder

715
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,840
<27-3,ESPOSITO>因为他也被派去拍摄狗狗选秀
<27-3,ESPOSITO>because he was issued credentials to that Dog Show.

716
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,010
<27-4,BECKETT>不用猜也知道他现在在哪
<27-4,BECKETT>Wonder where he might be now.

717
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,720
<28-1,CASTLE>谁是你的有线供应商
<28-1,CASTLE>Who is your cable service provider?

718
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,870
<28-1,CASTLE>因为我收不到这个频道
<28-1,CASTLE>Because I do not get this channel.

719
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,290
<28-1,CASTLE>出来
<28-1,CASTLE>Come here.

720
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,130
<29-1,BECKETT>认出你的作品了吗  马库斯
<29-1,BECKETT>You recognize your work, Marcus?

721
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,990
<29-2,ESPOSITO>凯·卡普奇诺认出了  买你照片那个人也认出了
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Kay Cappuccio did, and so did that Scandal Rag you sold it to.

722
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,520
<29-3,BECKET>你怎么接近那条狗的
<29-3,BECKET>How'd you get access to the dog?

723
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,730
<29-3,BECKET>你收买别人了吗
<29-3,BECKET>Did you pay someone off?

724
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,690
<29-4,MARCUS>你们推测的太不靠谱了
<29-4,MARCUS>You guys are way off base here, all right?

725
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,790
<29-4,MARCUS>听着  和你们想的不一样
<29-4,MARCUS>Look, it's not what you think.

726
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,440
<29-5,ESPOSITO>不是吗  因为我认为你知道
<29-5,ESPOSITO>No? 'Cause I think you knew

727
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,770
<29-5,ESPOSITO>如果弗兰斯科告诉凯项圈的事情
<29-5,ESPOSITO>that if Francisco told Kay about the collar,

728
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,170
<29-5,ESPOSITO>她会直接去找联邦调查局
<29-5,ESPOSITO>she'd go straight to the FBI.

729
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,190
<29-5,ESPOSITO>你的一切就玩完了
<29-5,ESPOSITO>And you saw your whole world crashing down around you.

730
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,300
<29-6,MARCUS>我没杀弗兰斯科那家伙
<29-6,MARCUS>I did not kill that Francisco guy.

731
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,600
<29-6,MARCUS>狗项圈上的摄像机也不是我装的
<29-6,MARCUS>And I didn't even wire that dog collar either.

732
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,610
<30-1,BECKETT>马库斯  我们刚刚抓到你...
<30-1,BECKETT>Marcus, we just caught you...

733
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,660
<30-2,CASTLE>谁是好孩子啊
<30-2,CASTLE>Who's a good boy, huh?

734
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,560
<30-2,CASTLE>谁是好孩子啊  马库斯是好孩子吗
<30-2,CASTLE>Who's a good boy? Is Marcus a good boy?

735
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,090
<30-2,CASTLE>不  他不是好孩子
<30-2,CASTLE>No, he's not a good boy.

736
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,000
<30-2,CASTLE>他是坏孩子
<30-2,CASTLE>He's a bad boy.

737
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,170
<30-3,MARCUS>黑进她的手机
<30-3,MARCUS>...hacked into her cell phone,

738
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,290
<30-3,MARCUS>也许  找些裸照什么的
<30-3,MARCUS>maybe, uh, find some nude pictures of her or something.

739
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,870
<30-3,MARCUS>但是不知怎么回事  我搜到了那视频信号
<30-3,MARCUS>But then outta nowhere, I pick up that video feed--

740
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,050
<31-1,MARCUS>凯·卡普奇诺脱下浴袍
<31-1,MARCUS>Kay Cappuccio dropping her bathrobe

741
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,810
<31-1,MARCUS>开始淋浴
<31-1,MARCUS>and jumping in to the shower.

742
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,200
<31-1,MARCUS>我知道他们说她没才华
<31-1,MARCUS>Look, I know they say she's got no talent,

743
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,430
<31-1,MARCUS>但是我得说  兄弟
<31-1,MARCUS>but let me tell you something, brother,

744
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,490
<31-1,MARCUS>那妞的"才华"比
<31-1,MARCUS>that girl's got more talent than a--

745
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,160
<31-2,ESPOSITO>你  说话注意点
<31-2,ESPOSITO>Hey! Watch your mouth.

746
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,330
<31-3,BECKETT>你真的以为我们会相信
<31-3,BECKETT>Do you actually expect us to believe

747
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,620
<31-3,BECKETT>你是无意间搜到那信号吗
<31-3,BECKETT>that you accidentally came across that feed?

748
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,190
<31-4,MARCUS>我都不知道信号从哪发出来
<31-4,MARCUS>Look, I didn't know where it was coming from,

749
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,670
<31-4,MARCUS>说真的  我不在乎
<31-4,MARCUS>and really, I didn't care.

750
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,480
<31-4,MARCUS>我是捡了下金蛋的鸡
<31-4,MARCUS>I was sitting on a gold mine,

751
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,860
<31-4,MARCUS>只是一开始我没有录制的设备
<31-4,MARCUS>only I didn't have the equipment to record it at first.

752
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,520
<31-4,MARCUS>所以我急忙弄好了一个
<31-4,MARCUS>So I scrambled to get it set up,

753
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,350
<31-4,MARCUS>但是那天晚些时候  他们把那狗
<31-4,MARCUS>but later that day, they shipped the dog off

754
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,770
<31-4,MARCUS>送给了那个该死的训练师
<31-4,MARCUS>to that damn trainer.

755
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,980
<31-5,BECKETT>这故事不错  马库斯
<31-5,BECKETT>Well, that's a great story, Marcus.

756
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,570
<31-5,BECKETT>听着
<31-5,BECKETT>Look...

757
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,520
<31-6,MARCUS>如果你们想找出谁杀了他
<31-6,MARCUS>If you want to find who killed him,

758
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,450
<31-6,MARCUS>那就查清他和谁在做生意
<31-6,MARCUS>find who he's doing business with.

759
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,090
<31-6,MARCUS>我指的不是他那训练狗的生意
<31-6,MARCUS>And I'm not talking about his dog training business either.

760
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,760
<31-7,BECKETT>那你指的是什么
<31-7,BECKETT>Then what are you talking about?

761
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,450
<31-8,MARCUS>我开回去去检查信号
<31-8,MARCUS>I drove back there to check on the signal, all right?

762
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,290
<31-8,MARCUS>想着也许我能搞清
<31-8,MARCUS>Thought maybe I could find out

763
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,950
<31-8,MARCUS>狗什么时候会送回到凯那里
<31-8,MARCUS>when the dog was going back to Kay.

764
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,320
<31-8,MARCUS>知道我听到弗兰斯科在谈论什么吗
<31-8,MARCUS>The things I heard that Francisco guy talking about?

765
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,870
<31-8,MARCUS>他可是搞了些不正经的东西
<31-8,MARCUS>Yeah, he was into some sketchy stuff.

766
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,020
<31-9,ESPOSITO>真的吗  兄弟
<31-9,ESPOSITO>Really, bro?

767
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,790
<31-9,ESPOSITO>你好意思坐在这说别人不正经
<31-9,ESPOSITO>You're gonna sit here and call someone else sketchy?

768
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,300
<31-10,MARCUS>听我说完好吗
<31-10,MARCUS>Listen to what I'm saying, all right?

769
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,660
<31-10,MARCUS>他说有阿根廷来的货物
<31-10,MARCUS>The guy was talking about shipments from Argentina,

770
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,370
<31-10,MARCUS>蒙混过关
<31-10,MARCUS>getting past customs,

771
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,840
<31-10,MARCUS>黑市价
<31-10,MARCUS>street values.

772
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,190
<32-1,CASTLE>是毒品吗
<32-1,CASTLE>Drugs?

773
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,150
<32-2,RYAN>是啊  符合他的旅行路线
<32-2,RYAN>Yeah, it seems to fit his travel.

774
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,640
<32-2,RYAN>除国际旅行外
<32-2,RYAN>In addition to his international trips,

775
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,200
<32-2,RYAN>大多都是去波士顿  新奥尔良  西雅图
<32-2,RYAN>made a lot of flights to Boston, New Orleans, Seattle,

776
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,840
<32-2,RYAN>长滩  迈阿密
<32-2,RYAN>Long Beach, Miami.

777
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,480
<32-3,CASTLE>-全是港口城市  -对
<32-3,CASTLE>- All port cities. - Exactly.

778
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,690
<32-4,RYAN>飞往世界各地给狗秀当评委
<32-4,RYAN>The international travel to judge dog shows--

779
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,000
<32-5,BECKETT>真是完美的掩护
<32-5,BECKETT>that's a perfect cover.

780
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,150
<32-6,CASTLE>这么说狗训练师是个毒品快递员
<32-6,CASTLE>So our dog trainer is a drug courier.

781
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,210
<32-6,CASTLE>难怪他疑神疑鬼担心被监听
<32-6,CASTLE>No wonder he was so paranoid about being bugged.

782
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,550
<32-7,BECKETT>那我们那天看到的仓库是...
<32-7,BECKETT>Then that warehouse that we saw...

783
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,480
<32-8,ESPOSITO>配种基地个屁
<32-8,ESPOSITO>Breeding facility, my ass.

784
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,280
<33-1,BECKETT>普拉尔寻回犬
<33-1,BECKETT>The Pilar retriever?

785
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,830
<33-2,PATTERSON>编的不错  不是吗
<33-2,PATTERSON>Pretty good story, right?

786
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,660
<33-2,PATTERSON>我总得想办法把你们赶出去
<33-2,PATTERSON>Hey, I had to get you outta there somehow.

787
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,670
<33-3,BECKETT>帕特森先生  恐怕你还不明白
<33-3,BECKETT>Mr. Patterson, I don't think you understand

788
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,680
<33-3,BECKETT>事情的严重性
<33-3,BECKETT>how serious this is.

789
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,910
<33-3,BECKETT>我们正在申请搜查令
<33-3,BECKETT>We're in the process of obtaining a warrant.

790
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,600
<33-3,BECKETT>会把仓库搜个底朝天
<33-3,BECKETT>We're gonna search that warehouse from top to bottom.

791
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,680
<33-4,CASTLE>我们很清楚
<33-4,CASTLE>And we got a pretty good idea

792
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,300
<33-4,CASTLE>能在那找到什么
<33-4,CASTLE>of what we're gonna find in there.

793
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,670
<33-5,PATTERSON>我来告诉你们能找到什么
<33-5,PATTERSON>Well, I'll tell you exactly what you'll find--

794
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,330
<33-5,PATTERSON>为躲过海关而特制的
<33-5,PATTERSON>Suitcases with false bottoms

795
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,130
<33-5,PATTERSON>活底手提箱
<33-5,PATTERSON>for smuggling drugs through customs,

796
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,390
<33-5,PATTERSON>两千克的纯阿根廷海洛因
<33-5,PATTERSON>about 2 kilos of pure Argentinean heroin.

797
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,040
<33-5,PATTERSON>前所未见的最优秀的缉毒犬
<33-5,PATTERSON>And the best drug-sniffing dogs we've ever had.

798
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,660
<33-6,PATTERSON>我不叫卡克·帕特森
<33-6,PATTERSON>My name's not Kack Patterson.

799
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,160
<33-6,PATTERSON>我是肯尼·维泽尔  美国海关探员
<33-6,PATTERSON>Kenny Weizer. U.S. Customs agent.

800
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,540
<33-6,PATTERSON>你们这有咖啡吗
<33-6,PATTERSON>You got any coffee?

801
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,960
<34-1,BECKETT>这么说弗兰斯科是在训练缉毒犬
<34-1,BECKETT>So Francisco was training drug-sniffing dogs?

802
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,320
<34-2,WISER>他手段太高明了
<34-2,WISER>His methods were amazing.

803
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,200
<34-2,WISER>不管我们认为货运到哪
<34-2,WISER>Personally handled deployment

804
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,930
<34-2,WISER>他都亲自部署调度
<34-2,WISER>wherever we thought the shipment was coming in.

805
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,160
<34-3,CASTLE>这就解释了去港口城市的旅行
<34-3,CASTLE>Which explains all that travel to those port cities,

806
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,630
<34-3,CASTLE>那些收入  遮遮掩掩
<34-3,CASTLE>and the payments, and the secrecy.

807
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,190
<34-4,WISER>很抱歉在仓库时没跟你们坦白
<34-4,WISER>Yeah, sorry about giving you the runaround at the warehouse,

808
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,340
<34-4,WISER>但当你跟贩毒集团打交道时
<34-4,WISER>but when you're dealing with the cartels,

809
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,360
<34-4,WISER>你不得不加倍小心
<34-4,WISER>you can't be too careful.

810
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,590
<34-5,BECKETT>所以你供出凯·卡普奇诺
<34-5,BECKETT>Oh, so that's why you gave us Kay Cappuccio's name,

811
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,610
<34-5,BECKETT>你以为是她监听弗兰斯科
<34-5,BECKETT>because you thought she bugged Francisco.

812
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,600
<34-6,WISER>不挑明我们对瓦奎斯业务的意图
<34-6,WISER>Yeah, we couldn't really launch an investigation

813
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,530
<34-6,WISER>我们是无法展开调查的
<34-6,WISER>without tipping our hand to the Vasquez operation.

814
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,730
<34-6,WISER>所以我想  我告诉你们我所掌握的
<34-6,WISER>So I figured, I'd tell you what I know,

815
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,760
<34-6,WISER>看你们能查到些什么
<34-6,WISER>see where you could get.

816
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,620
<34-7,BECKETT>瓦奎斯  是阿根廷的贩毒集团对吗
<34-7,BECKETT>Vasquez--that's out of Argentina, right?

817
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,190
<34-8,WISER>一个庞大的走私海洛因的家族
<34-8,WISER>That's a huge heroin smuggling family.

818
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,560
<34-9,BECKETT>维泽尔探员
<34-9,BECKETT>Agent Weizer,

819
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,680
<34-10,CASTLE>弗兰斯科的狗嗅到毒品时
<34-10,CASTLE>what are Francisco's dogs trained to do

820
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,100
<34-10,CASTLE>会有什么反应
<34-10,CASTLE>when they smell drugs?

821
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,960
<34-11,WISER>它们会猛抓地板  怎么了
<34-11,WISER>They paw at the ground. Why?

822
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,430
<34-13,CASTLE>罗亚尔就是这种反应
<34-13,CASTLE>Because that's what Royal was doing.

823
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,890
<34-13,CASTLE>所以我想狗治疗师是对的
<34-13,CASTLE>So I guess that dog therapist was right.

824
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,210
<34-13,CASTLE>它想告诉我们一些事
<34-13,CASTLE>He was trying to tell us something.

825
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,700
<34-13,CASTLE>它在凶手身上嗅到了毒品的味道
<34-13,CASTLE>He smelled drugs on our killer.

826
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,890
<34-14,WISER>那说得通   瓦奎斯贩毒集团
<34-14,WISER>Well, that makes sense. The Vasquez cartel had

827
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,920
<34-14,WISER>从弗兰斯科的死中获益匪浅
<34-14,WISER>a hell of a lot to gain from Francisco's death.

828
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,390
<34-14,WISER>他训练出的缉毒犬  导致货物被查
<34-14,WISER>His program was costing them a fortune

829
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,690
<34-14,WISER>损失了很多钱
<34-14,WISER>in intercepted shipments.

830
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,370
<34-15,BECKETT>这就是他们监视监听弗兰斯科的原因
<34-15,BECKETT>Which is why they wanted eyes and ears on Francisco.

831
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,720
<34-15,BECKETT>他们想知道海关稽查是怎么进行的
<34-15,BECKETT>They wanted to figure out how the customs' operation worked.

832
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,850
<34-16,CASTLE>但当弗兰斯科意识到他被监听后
<34-16,CASTLE>But once Francisco realized he was under surveillance,

833
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,050
<34-16,CASTLE>他们知道自己暴露了
<34-16,CASTLE>they knew he was on to them.

834
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,040
<34-17,WISER>所以他们找人干掉他
<34-17,WISER>So they got someone to finish him off.

835
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,540
<34-17,WISER>可能就是在凯·卡普奇诺的狗颈圈上
<34-17,WISER>Probably the same person

836
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,800
<34-17,WISER>装监视器的那个人
<34-17,WISER>who wired Kay Cappuccio's dog collar.

837
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,380
<35-1,CASTLE>要想在狗颈圈上装监视器
<35-1,CASTLE>Whoever wired up that dog collar

838
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,130
<35-1,CASTLE>必须具备三个条件
<35-1,CASTLE>had to have three things.

839
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,550
<35-1,CASTLE>首先  能够接触到狗
<35-1,CASTLE>One--access to the dog.

840
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,030
<35-1,CASTLE>其次  知晓弗兰斯科会训练那只狗
<35-1,CASTLE>Two--knowledge that Francisco would be training that dog.

841
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,100
<35-1,CASTLE>第三  与瓦奎斯贩毒集团有某种关联
<35-1,CASTLE>Three--some connection to the Vasquez cartel.

842
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,560
<35-1,CASTLE>凶手就藏在
<35-1,CASTLE>The intersection of these three circles

843
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,060
<35-1,CASTLE>三个圈圈重合之处
<35-1,CASTLE>holds the identity of our killer.

844
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,060
<35-2,CASTLE>它又抓地板了
<35-2,CASTLE>He's doing that thing again.

845
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,180
<35-3,BECKETT>是啊  可我身上没海洛因啊  卡塞尔
<35-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but I don't have any heroin on me, Castle.

846
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,030
<35-4,CASTLE>但它为何会那样呢  除非
<35-4,CASTLE>Well, why would he react like that unless...

847
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,940
<35-4,CASTLE>贝克特  你搽香水了吗
<35-4,CASTLE>Beckett, are you wearing perfume?

848
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,760
<35-4,CASTLE>为了给以后做参考  我偏爱"喧嚣"
<35-4,CASTLE>And just for future reference, I am partial to Fracas.

849
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,030
<35-5,BECKETT>别臭美了
<35-5,BECKETT>Listen, don't flatter yourself, okay?

850
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,690
<35-5,BECKETT>我只是喷了点
<35-5,BECKETT>I just spritzed some of this stuff

851
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,740
<35-5,BECKETT>凯送的礼物篮里的香水
<35-5,BECKETT>that Kay sent over in the gift basket.

852
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,340
<35-6,CASTLE>它为什么会对香水有反应
<35-6,CASTLE>Why would he react to that?

853
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,360
<35-7,BECKETT>因为主要成分是婴栗花的提炼物
<35-7,BECKETT>Because the main ingredient is essence of poppy flower.

854
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,400
<35-8,ESPOSITO>海洛因是由吗啡提炼的
<35-8,ESPOSITO>And heroin is made from morphine,

855
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,360
<35-8,ESPOSITO>而吗啡又取自婴栗
<35-8,ESPOSITO>which comes from the opium poppy.

856
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,620
<35-9,ESPOSITO>假设在凶案现场
<35-9,ESPOSITO>Guys, what if, at the crime scene,

857
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,840
<35-9,ESPOSITO>令它有反应的不是毒品
<35-9,ESPOSITO>he was pawing not at drugs,

858
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,690
<35-9,ESPOSITO>而是香水的香味
<35-9,ESPOSITO>but at the scent of that perfume.

859
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,580
<35-10,BECKETT>有可能  但这款香水还未上市
<35-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but this perfume hasn't even come out yet.

860
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,300
<35-10,BECKETT>谁会搽这款香水呢
<35-10,BECKETT>I mean, who would be wearing it?

861
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,920
<35-11,CASTLE>就一个人
<35-11,CASTLE>Only one person.

862
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
<35-13,CASTLE>-不会是凯  -可她的确在凶案现场出现过
<35-13,CASTLE>- Not kay. - Well, she was at the crime scene.

863
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,560
<35-14,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  我们现在谈的可不是狗仔  名人
<35-14,ESPOSITO>Castle, we're not talking about paparazzi and celebrities.

864
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,000
<35-14,ESPOSITO>我们说的是一个贩毒集团
<35-14,ESPOSITO>We're dealing with a drug cartel.

865
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,660
<35-15,CASTLE>好  那我们回忆下要找的疑犯特征
<35-15,CASTLE>Okay, well, let's remember what we're looking for.

866
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,040
<35-15,CASTLE>首先  能够接触到狗  打勾
<35-15,CASTLE>One--access to the dog. Check.

867
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,330
<35-15,CASTLE>其次  知晓弗兰斯科会训练那只狗  打勾
<35-15,CASTLE>Two--knowledge that Francisco was training the dog. Check.

868
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,060
<35-15,CASTLE>就是不确定跟贩毒集团是否有联系
<35-15,CASTLE>Only thing we're missing is a connection to the cartel.

869
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,580
<35-16,RYAN>我想我找到两者间的联系了
<35-16,RYAN>Uh, guys, I think I might have our link.

870
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,240
<35-16,RYAN>凯·卡普奇诺六个月前在阿根廷拍了广告
<35-16,RYAN>Kay Cappuccio shot a commercial in Argentina six months ago.

871
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,750
<35-16,RYAN>那又如何
<35-16,RYAN>So?

872
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,210
<35-17,ESPOSITO>阿根廷那么大
<35-17,ESPOSITO>Argentina's a big country.

873
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,280
<35-17,ESPOSITO>这不能说明她和瓦奎斯家族有联系
<35-17,ESPOSITO>It doesn't mean that she's connected to the Vasquez family.

874
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,110
<35-18,RYAN>但是我下面说的能
<35-18,RYAN>But this does.

875
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,710
<35-18,RYAN>她住在朱尼尔·瓦奎斯家里
<35-18,RYAN>She stayed at the compound of Junior Vasquez,

876

<35-18,RYAN>贩毒集团的首席副官
<35-18,RYAN>first lieutenant of the cartel.

877
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,390
<35-19,BECKETT>她就是凶手
<35-19,BECKETT>She's the one.

879
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,130
<35-19,BECKETT>我只想和我所有的粉丝们问声好
<35-19,BECKETT>I just wanna say hi to all my fans out there.

880

<35-19,BECKETT>打个招呼  洛丽塔
<35-19,BECKETT>Say hi, Lolita.

881
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,930

<36-2,CASTLE>Kay Cappuccio's guilty pleasure--

884
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,580
<36-2,CASTLE>确保他的罪名是渴望得到你
<36-2,CASTLE>make sure he's guilty of wanting you.

885
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,830
<36-2,CASTLE>罪恶的欢愉
<36-2,CASTLE>Guilty pleasure

886
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,170
<36-2,CASTLE>还是只有罪恶
<36-2,CASTLE>or just guilty?

887
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,240
<36-3,KAY>这段录像和案子有什么关系
<36-3,KAY>What does this video have to do with anything?

888
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,130
<36-4,BECKETT>录像拍摄完十五分钟  你去后台
<36-4,BECKETT>This was about 15 minutes before you went backstage

<36-5,KAY>So?

891
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,610
<36-6,BECKETT>我们有理由怀疑
<36-6,BECKETT>So we have reason to suspect

892
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,030
<36-6,BECKETT>凶手搽了你的香水
<36-6,BECKETT>that our killer was wearing your perfume.

893
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,230
<36-7,KAY>那不可能  它还没上市
<36-7,KAY>Well, that's impossible. It wasn't even out yet.

894
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,690
<36-7,KAY>唯一搽那香水的人是我
<36-7,KAY>I'm the only person that had it.

895
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,830
<37-1,RYAN>她有意识到自己变相认罪了吗
<37-1,RYAN>Does she realize she just incriminated herself?

896
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,140
<37-2,ESPOSITO>我说过她人很好  没说她聪明
<37-2,ESPOSITO>I said she was nice. I didn't say anything about smart.

<39-1,BECKETT>What's your relationship with Junior Vasquez?

911
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,310
<39-2,KAY>朱尼尔  他真是个甜心
<39-2,KAY>Junior? He is such a sweetheart.

<39-3,BECKETT>你知道瓦奎斯家族是
<39-3,BECKETT>Do you realize that the Vasquez family

<39-4,KAY>失陪

00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,690
<39-6,KAY>海洛因  谋杀
<39-6,KAY>Heroin, murder--

922
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,170
<39-6,KAY>真希望我从来都没听说过弗兰斯科
<39-6,KAY>I just wish I had never even heard of Francisco.

923
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,890
<39-7,CASTLE>凯  你...
<39-7,CASTLE>Kay, how...

924
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,570
<39-7,CASTLE>你是怎么知道他这个人的
<39-7,CASTLE>How did you hear about him?

925
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,450
<39-7,CASTLE>通过雷吉
<39-7,CASTLE>Reggie.

926
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,220
<39-8,KAY>他在杂志之类的东西里看到他
<39-8,KAY>He read about him in, like, a magazine or something.

927
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,400
<39-8,KAY>他说他是最棒的  他坚持让我雇佣他
<39-8,KAY>He said he was the best, so he insisted I use him.

928
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,300
<39-9,CASTLE>那让洛丽塔
<39-9,CASTLE>So it was Reggie's idea

929
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,610
<39-9,CASTLE>去弗兰斯科那训练也是雷吉的主意吗
<39-9,CASTLE>that Lolita go to Francisco for training?

930
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,410
<39-10,KAY>是啊
<39-10,KAY>Yeah.

931
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,780
<39-11,KAY>确保他的罪名是渴望得到你
<39-11,KAY>Make sure he's guilty of wanting you.

932
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,130
<39-11,KAY>嗨  宝贝
<39-11,KAY>Hi, baby.

933
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,480
<40-1,BECKETT>你确定吗
<40-1,BECKETT>Are you sure about this?

934
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,370
<40-2,ESPOSITO>确定
<40-2,ESPOSITO>Positive.

935
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,560
<40-2,ESPOSITO>海关的确是把凯和瓦奎斯联系起来了
<40-2,ESPOSITO>Customs connected Kay to the Vasquez family all right,

936
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,650
<40-2,ESPOSITO>是通过雷吉
<40-2,ESPOSITO>through Reggie.

937
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,010
<40-2,ESPOSITO>原来他跟瓦奎斯的孩子上同一所学校
<40-2,ESPOSITO>Turns out he went to school with one of the Vasquez kids.

938
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,120
<40-2,ESPOSITO>他才是关联  不是凯
<40-2,ESPOSITO>He's the connection, not Kay.

939
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,720
<40-2,ESPOSITO>小心
<40-2,ESPOSITO>Look out!

940
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,470
<40-2,ESPOSITO>搞定他  罗亚尔
<40-2,ESPOSITO>Get him, Royal.

941
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,930
<41-1,BECKETT>他对全部罪行供认不讳
<41-1,BECKETT>So he confessed to the whole thing.

942
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,320
<41-1,BECKETT>瓦奎斯贩毒集团怀疑弗兰斯科
<41-1,BECKETT>The Vasquez cartel suspected that Francisco

943
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,590
<41-1,BECKETT>为海关训练狗狗
<41-1,BECKETT>was training dogs for customs.

944
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,100
<41-1,BECKETT>而当凯需要训练洛丽塔的时候
<41-1,BECKETT>And then when Kay needed Lolita trained,

945
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,900
<41-1,BECKETT>雷吉将她引向弗兰斯科
<41-1,BECKETT>Reggie steered her towards Francisco

946
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,260
<41-1,BECKETT>然后在狗项圈上安了摄像头
<41-1,BECKETT>and then wired the dog collar.

947
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,300
<41-2,CASTLE>但这事被弗兰斯科发现  雷吉就慌了
<41-2,CASTLE>But Francisco caught on, and Reggie panicked.

948
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,020
<41-2,CASTLE>他觉得自己必须保护贩毒集团
<41-2,CASTLE>He felt he had to protect the cartel.

949
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,760
<41-3,BECKETT>雷吉想要在贩毒集团面前好好表现
<41-3,BECKETT>Yeah, and Reggie wanted to get in good with the cartel.

950
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,650
<41-3,BECKETT>他知道他在凯这吃软饭的日子
<41-3,BECKETT>He knew that his days of mooching off of kay

951
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,420
<41-3,BECKETT>要到头了  尽管媒体在报道
<41-3,BECKETT>were almost over, in spite of all the reports

952
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,600
<41-3,BECKETT>她俩要结婚
<41-3,BECKETT>that the two of them were getting married.

953
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,360
<41-4,CASTLE>等等  你是说...小报报道错了
<41-4,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa. You mean... the tabloids were wrong?

954
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,230
<41-5,BECKETT>是的
<41-5,BECKETT>Yeah, and, um,

955
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,690
<41-5,BECKETT>还有一件事我也想错了
<41-5,BECKETT>you know, I was wrong about something, too.

956
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,140
<41-5,BECKETT>分局有个吉祥物挺有用的
<41-5,BECKETT>Turns out having a mascot in the precinct can be pretty useful.

957
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,980
<41-6,CASTLE>我在想  或许今晚你带它回家
<41-6,CASTLE>So I was thinking for tonight, maybe you take him home,

958
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,990
<41-6,CASTLE>我大概在晚上九点半来接它
<41-6,CASTLE>and then I'll swing by, pick him up, maybe 9:30?

959
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,960
<41-7,BECKETT>我不确定  卡塞尔
<41-7,BECKETT>Oh, I don't know, Castle.

960
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,910
<41-7,BECKETT>我认为这种轮流制
<41-7,BECKETT>I don't know if this whole splitting time thing

961
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,490
<41-7,BECKETT>不是长久之计
<41-7,BECKETT>is good long-term solution.

962
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,170
<41-8,CASTLE>那怎么办  隔天晚上  工作日周末吗
<41-8,CASTLE>Well, what then, alternating nights, uh, weekends/weekdays?

963
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,110
<41-9,BECKETT>我想那样会把它搞糊涂的
<41-9,BECKETT>I-I think it'll just confuse the poor guy.

964
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,010
<41-10,CASTLE>是啊  它已经做了足够的心理治疗了
<41-10,CASTLE>God knows, he's had enough therapy.

965
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,500
<41-11,BECKETT>我认为它应该在一个住处安家
<41-11,BECKETT>I think he deserves one home.

966
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,670
<41-12,CASTLE>我明白怎么回事了
<41-12,CASTLE>Oh, I see where this is going.

967
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,020
<41-13,BECKETT>不  不是石子剪刀布
<41-13,BECKETT>Uh, no. No, no roshambo.

968
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,160
<41-14,CASTLE>有更好的主意吗
<41-14,CASTLE>You got a better idea?

969
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,310
<41-15,BECKETT>我认为应该由罗亚尔来决定
<41-15,BECKETT>I think we should let Royal decide.

970
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,830
<41-15,BECKETT>我们分别站在房间的两头
<41-15,BECKETT>We go to opposite ends of the room,

971
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,020
<41-15,BECKETT>它走向谁  就住谁家
<41-15,BECKETT>and wherever he goes, that's home.

972
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,300
<41-16,CASTLE>好嘞
<41-16,CASTLE>Let's do it.

<41-17,CASTLE>坐好
<41-17,CASTLE>Stay there.

976
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:21,750
<41-18,CASTLE>好了
<41-18,CASTLE>All right.

<41-19,BECKETT>Ready?

978
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,730
<41-19,BECKETT>准备好了

<41-23,BECKETT>- It's a big decision... - Royal, who loves you?

<41-25,BECKETT>我的沙发超级舒服
<41-25,BECKETT>My couch is super comfortable.

989
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,870
<41-29,KAY>看来它做出决定了
<41-29,KAY>Looks like he's made his choice,

<41-29,KAY>是我
<41-29,KAY>and it's me.

<41-31,BECKETT>-你好啊  -你确定要收留它吗
<41-31,BECKETT>- Hi, buddy. - Are you sure you want to take him?

995
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,830
<41-32,CASTLE>或许我们应该来个三局两胜
<41-32,CASTLE>Yeah, maybe we should do two out of three.

996
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,270
<41-33,KAY>我和洛丽塔需要一个强壮的男性在家
<41-33,KAY>Oh, yes, Lolita and I need a big strong man around the house,

997
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,610
<41-34,KAY>尤其是像它这么忠诚的
<41-34,KAY>Especially one as loyal as this,

998
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,620
<41-34,KAY>对不对
<41-34,KAY>right, bud?

999

<41-35,KAY>And you have been so sweet.

1001
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:18,550
<41-36,ESPOSITO>呃  那个  我知道狗仔队有时
<41-36,ESPOSITO>Hey, if--you know, I know that the paparazzi can be

1002
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,820
<41-36,ESPOSITO>很恶劣  如果你有需要
<41-36,ESPOSITO>very vicious sometimes, so if you ever need anything,

1003
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,110
<41-36,ESPOSITO>我是说任何事
<41-36,ESPOSITO>like, I mean anything at all,

1006
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,650
<41-38,BECKETT>你知道吗  这也许是最好的解决办法
<41-38,BECKETT>Well, you know what? I mean, I'm sure it's for the best.

1007
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,510
<41-38,BECKETT>它在我家会很寂寞的
<41-38,BECKETT>He woulda been lonely at my place.

1008
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,510
<41-38,BECKETT>没人跟它玩
<41-38,BECKETT>There's nobody to play with.

1009
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,830
<41-39,CASTLE>是啊  我家也是
<41-39,CASTLE>Yeah, mine, too.

1010
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,080
<41-39,CASTLE>它们倒是挺喜欢对方的
<41-39,CASTLE>They do look like they enjoy each other.

1011
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,600
<42-1,CASTLE>亲爱的
<42-1,CASTLE>Hey, sweetheart.

1012
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,590
<42-1,CASTLE>旅途如何
<42-1,CASTLE>How was your trip?

1013
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,830
<42-2,ALEXIS>挺有趣  想我了吗
<42-2,ALEXIS>We had fun. Miss me?

1014
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,110
<42-3,CASTLE>非常想
<42-3,CASTLE>Ah, terribly.

1015
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,110
<42-3,CASTLE>但是在没有你的情况下  我也过得不错
<42-3,CASTLE>But I did manage to have a good time without you

1016
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:00,960
<42-3,CASTLE>跟我的新朋友大狗罗亚尔
<42-3,CASTLE>with my new friend Royal the dog.

1017
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,930
<42-4,ALEXIS>你买了一条狗吗
<42-4,ALEXIS>You got a dog?

1018
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,830
<42-5,CASTLE>没有  但是我照顾它了一段时间
<42-5,CASTLE>No, but I was looking after him for a while,

1019
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,750
<42-5,CASTLE>之后我就琢磨
<42-5,CASTLE>but it made me think.

1020
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,100
<42-5,CASTLE>你小时候
<42-5,CASTLE>All those times when you were little,

1021
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,430
<42-5,CASTLE>总是求我养条狗  我拒绝是因为
<42-5,CASTLE>how you begged me for a dog, and I refused because--

1022
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,040
<42-6,ALEXIS>你说  最后总是要你来喂它
<42-6,ALEXIS>You said, you'd be the one who'd wind up having to feed it,

1023
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,560
<42-6,ALEXIS>而每天你能记得喂我就已经够难的了
<42-6,ALEXIS>and it was hard enough remembering to feed me every day.

1024
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,270
<42-7,CASTLE>是啊  咦  最后那句我不记得了
<42-7,CASTLE>Yeah, I... I don't remember that last part.

1025
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,380
<42-8,ALEXIS>潜台词哦
<42-8,ALEXIS>It was subtext.

1026
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,830
<42-8,ALEXIS>有那么一点这个意思
<42-8,ALEXIS>Barely.

1027
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,700
<42-9,CASTLE>总之呢  我想要补偿你
<42-9,CASTLE>Anyway, I want to make it up to you.

1028
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,000
<42-9,CASTLE>我要给你买条狗
<42-9,CASTLE>I want to get you a dog.

1029
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,950
<42-9,CASTLE>唯一的问题是  你想要哪种
<42-9,CASTLE>Only question is, what kind of dog do we get?

1030
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,070
<42-9,CASTLE>起什么名字  在哪间房睡觉
<42-9,CASTLE>What are we gonna name it? Whose room is it gonna sleep--

1031
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,310
<42-10,ALEXIS>老爸  别急
<42-10,ALEXIS>Whoa, dad, slow down.

1032
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,990
<42-10,ALEXIS>我要去上大学了  记得吗
<42-10,ALEXIS>I'm leaving for college soon, remember?

1033
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,830
<42-10,ALEXIS>而宿舍是不让养狗的
<42-10,ALEXIS>You can't have a dog in your dorm room.

1034
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:36,900
<42-10,ALEXIS>是哦
<42-10,ALEXIS>Right.

1035
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,130
<42-11,CASTLE>我知道  那我在这照顾它
<42-11,CASTLE>Well, I know. I'll just take care of him here.

1036
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,590
<42-11,CASTLE>你可以随时回来看它
<42-11,CASTLE>You can come visit him whenever you can.

1037
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,450
<42-12,ALEXIS>那么...这条你想买的狗
<42-12,ALEXIS>So... this dog you want to get,

1038
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,900
<42-12,ALEXIS>为我而买
<42-12,ALEXIS>you know, for me.

1039
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,570
<42-12,ALEXIS>不会是想把我尽可能地
<42-12,ALEXIS>This wouldn't be an enticement

1040
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,970
<42-12,ALEXIS>从大学吸引回家的引诱物吧
<42-12,ALEXIS>to come home from college more often, would it?

1041
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,220
<42-13,CASTLE>别假装你比我聪明
<42-13,CASTLE>Don't pretend like you're smarter than me.

1042
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,370
<42-13,CASTLE>潜台词是我教你的  丫头
<42-13,CASTLE>I taught you subtext, young lady.

1043
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,130
<42-13,CASTLE>别担心
<42-13,CASTLE>Don't worry.

1044
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,280
<42-14,ALEXIS>我会没完没了地回来
<42-14,ALEXIS>I'll come back and visit so much,

1045
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,340
<42-14,ALEXIS>让你都受不了
<42-14,ALEXIS>you'll be sick of me.

1046
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,820
<42-15,CASTLE>保证吗
<42-15,CASTLE>Promise?

1047
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,840
<42-15,CASTLE>保证
<42-15,CASTLE>Yeah.

1048
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,670
<42-16,ALEXIS>总得有人隔段时间给你搞点吃的吧[喂狗的说法]
<42-16,ALEXIS>Someone has to leave food out for you once in a while.

1049
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,980
<42-17,CASTLE>说到这个  我有点饿了
<42-17,CASTLE>Speaking of, I'm kinda hungry right now.

1050
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,120
<42-18,ALEXIS>狗饼干
<42-18,ALEXIS>Kibbles 'n bits?

1051
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,810
<42-19,CASTLE>用勺子吃花生酱
<42-19,CASTLE>Peanut butter on a spoon?

1052
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:17,780
<42-20,ALEXIS>中餐
<42-20,ALEXIS>Chinese.

1053
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,030

<42-21,CASTLE>I'd like a sandwich.

1054
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,400
<42-21,CASTLE>欢迎回家
<42-21,CASTLE>Welcome home.
