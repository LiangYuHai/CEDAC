10
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,360
<1-1,JOE>再续上  朋友  干的不错
<1-1,JOE>Keep 'em comin', pal. You're doing great.

11
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,180
<1-2,JOE>说不定你能助我一臂之力  我在找个女人
<1-2,JOE>Say, maybe you can help me. I'm lookin' for a dame.

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,610
<1-3,BARTENDER>谁不在找呢
<1-3,BARTENDER>Aren't we all?

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,230
<1-4,JOE>这个人很特别  你认识她吗
<1-4,JOE>This one's special. You know her?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,060
<1-5,BARTENDER>何止认识
<1-5,BARTENDER>Know her?

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,880
<1-5,BARTENDER>我正看着她呢
<1-5,BARTENDER>I'm lookin' at her.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,150
<1-5,BARTENDER>我怎么才遇见你
<1-5,BARTENDER>And where have you been all my life?

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,770
<1-5,BARTENDER>要说到一段历史
<1-5,BARTENDER>Talk about a slice of history.

18
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,200
<1-5,BARTENDER>这个佩尼贝克俱乐部
<1-5,BARTENDER>The Pennybaker Club.

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,670
<2-1,CASTLE>可是20世纪40年代  大腕齐聚登台的地方
<2-1,CASTLE>You know, back in the '40s, all the greats played here.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,220
<2-1,CASTLE>要是这些墙会说话  故事可有得说了
<2-1,CASTLE>If these walls could talk, man, the stories they would tell.

21
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,700
<2-2,BECKETT>对  不过我们唯一想听的故事是...
<2-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but the only story we need to hear is about...

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,510
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>斯坦·班克斯的  胸骨有一处枪伤
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>Stan Banks. Single G.S.W. to the sternum.

23
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,040
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>我推断死亡时间
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>I'm calling the time of death

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,540
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>在今早6点到8点期间
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>between 6:00 and 8:00 this morning.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,910
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>看来他试图用这个防卫
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>Looks like he tried to defend himself with this.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,570
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>显然  没起到作用
<2-3,LANIE PARISH>Obviously, it didn't work.

27
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,980
<2-4,BECKETT>那么是抢劫财变杀人了吗
<2-4,BECKETT>So a robbery gone wrong?

28
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,520
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>但他的钱包  手机
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Well, he still had his wallet, cell,

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,630
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>还有帕克斯维尔湾的房间钥匙还在  所以...
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>and a room key from the parksville arms, so...

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,000
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>口袋被掏了出来
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>Pockets were pulled out,

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,130
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>表明凶手对尸体搜了身
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>indicating the killer searched the body.

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,390
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>找什么  我们无从得知
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>For what, we have no idea.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,790
<2-7,BECKETT>奇怪了  他有一把单身公寓的钥匙
<2-7,BECKETT>That's weird. He's got an S.R.O. key,

34
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,220
<2-7,BECKETT>可他的驾照上显示他住在34号大街[富人区]
<2-7,BECKETT>but his driver's license has him living on 34th Street.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,270
<2-8,RYAN>我们去单身公寓走一趟
<2-8,RYAN>We'll hit the S.R.O.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,790
<2-8,RYAN>看看能不能找到点他的线索
<2-8,RYAN>See if there's anything we can find out about him.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,520
<2-9,BECKETT>谢谢
<2-9,BECKETT>Thanks.

38
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,070
<2-10,BECKETT>你在找酒喝吗  卡塞尔
<2-10,BECKETT>You lookin' for a drink, Castle?

39
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,420
<2-10,BECKETT>因为我确定吧台已经关了
<2-10,BECKETT>'Cause I'm pretty sure the bar is closed.

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,500
<2-11,CASTLE>实际上  我在找线索
<2-11,CASTLE>Actually, I was looking for a clue.

41
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,780
<2-11,CASTLE>找到一个
<2-11,CASTLE>I think I found one.

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,750
<2-11,CASTLE>哪个流浪汉的小窝  还有...
<2-11,CASTLE>Some homeless guy's squat, and...

43
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,640
<2-11,CASTLE>今天的《账报》  他今天早上还在这里
<2-11,CASTLE>today's "Ledger." He was here this morning.

44
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,920
<2-12,BECKETT>不管是谁  或许他目睹了什么
<2-12,BECKETT>Well, whoever he is, maybe he saw something.

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,230
<2-12,BECKETT>我让巡逻小队去排查这片区域
<2-12,BECKETT>I'll get patrol units to canvass the area.

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,630
<2-12,BECKETT>斯坦死了
<2-12,BECKETT>Stan's dead?

47
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,990
<3-1,MANAGER>这下可好
<3-1,MANAGER>Well, that's just great.

48
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,400
<3-1,MANAGER>我该怎么处置他的这堆破玩意儿
<3-1,MANAGER>What am I supposed to do with all his crap?

49
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,870
<3-2,RYAN>我们会先带走些东西
<3-2,RYAN>We'll be taking some of it off your hands

50
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,910
<3-2,RYAN>这是我们的调查职责
<3-2,RYAN>as part of our investigation.

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,820
<3-3,ESPOSITO>你知道最近有谁在威胁斯坦吗
<3-3,ESPOSITO>You know of anyone who's been threatening Stan lately?

52
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,700
<3-4,MANAGER>我是这里的管理员  不是童子军的女训导员
<3-4,MANAGER>I'm the manager here, not the den mother.

53
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,950
<3-5,RYAN>那好吧  你最近一次看到他是什么时候
<3-5,RYAN>Okay, then. When was the last time you saw him?

54
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,300
<3-6,MANAGER>今天早上  斯坦满脸笑容
<3-6,MANAGER>Uh, this morning. Stan was all smiles.

55
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,710
<3-6,MANAGER>通知我他要搬走了
<3-6,MANAGER>Gave notice he was moving out

56
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,110
<3-6,MANAGER>因为他的船要来了[鸿运当头]
<3-6,MANAGER>'cause his ship was coming in.

57
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,050
<3-7,RYAN>-什么船  -不知道
<3-7,RYAN>- What ship? - Oh, I don't know.

58
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,670
<3-8,MANAGER>看现在这状况  估计是"泰坦尼克"号
<3-8,MANAGER>The "Titanic" from the looks of things.

59
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,400
<3-9,ESPOSITO>如果你还记起其它事
<3-9,ESPOSITO>Well, if you can remember anything else,

60
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,500
<3-9,ESPOSITO>能给我们打电话吗
<3-9,ESPOSITO>can you please give me a call?

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,260
<3-10,MANAGER>别太指望我了  帅哥
<3-10,MANAGER>Don't hold your breath, hotshot.

62
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,800
<3-11,RYAN>我觉得她喜欢你
<3-11,RYAN>I think she likes you.

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,570
<3-11,RYAN>我不知道为什么斯坦怎么会在佩尼贝克俱乐部
<3-11,RYAN>I have no idea why Stan was at the Pennybaker Club.

64
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,870
<3-11,RYAN>可我们已经分居快一年了
<3-11,RYAN>But we've been separated for almost a year,

65
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,610
<3-11,RYAN>所以天知道他去哪里了
<3-11,RYAN>so god knows where he's been.

66
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,670
<4-1,BECKETT>那你最后一次和他联系是什么时候
<4-1,BECKETT>And when was the last time you spoke with him?

67
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,530
<4-1,BECKETT>两个月前  说来真是疯狂
<4-1,BECKETT>Two months ago, which is crazy,

68
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,590
<4-2,CASTLE>因为以前我们两个小时不说话都不行
<4-2,CASTLE>'cause there was a time we couldn't go two hours without talking.

69
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,170
<4-2,CASTLE>可后来斯坦非要去找达布隆
<4-2,CASTLE>But then Stan had to go and find that doubloon.

70
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,040
<4-2,CASTLE>达布隆  是西班牙古币吗
<4-2,CASTLE>A doubloon, as in old Spanish coin?

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
<10-6,CASTLE>他在北卡罗来纳的一个海滩上挖到一枚
<10-6,CASTLE>He dug one up on a beach in North Carolina.

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,100
<10-7,CASTLE>从那以后  他就着了迷
<10-7,CASTLE>And after that, he got the bug.

73
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,210
<9-3,BECKETT>而他看了那愚蠢的纪录片后就更变本加厉了
<9-3,BECKETT>And it only got worse after he saw this stupid documentary

74
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,440
<9-4,CASTLE>讲的是克莱德·贝拉斯科  一个寻宝猎人
<9-4,CASTLE>about Clyde Belasco, the treasure hunter.

75
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,400
<9-5,BECKETT>对  就是那个人
<9-5,BECKETT>Yeah, that's the fellow

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,270
<9-6,CASTLE>十年前找到了沉没的南联邦船只
<9-6,CASTLE>who found that sunken confederate ship ten years ago.

77
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,460
<9-7,RYAN>斯坦倍受鼓舞
<9-7,RYAN>Stan was so inspired,

78
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,370
<9-6,CASTLE>他辞去会计工作  去寻找失落的古迹
<9-6,CASTLE>he quit his accounting job to search for lost antiquities.

79
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,170
<9-6,CASTLE>即便是我们上一次谈话时
<9-6,CASTLE>I mean, even the last time we spoke,

80
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,220
<9-5,BECKETT>他还是满嘴都是他离找到蓝蝴蝶
<9-5,BECKETT>all he could talk about was how he was close

81
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,740
<9-4,CASTLE>仅有一步之遥
<9-4,CASTLE>to finding a blue butterfly.

82
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,330
<14-3,RYAN>蓝...是种昆虫吗
<14-3,RYAN>A blue... like an insect?

83
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,720
<14-4,RAY>谁知道
<14-4,RAY>Who knows?

84
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,020
<14-4,RAY>在你认识的人里  他和谁有过节吗
<14-4,RAY>Was he having problems with anyone that you know of?

85
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,810
<14-4,RAY>他有债务问题  这我知道
<14-4,RAY>He had money problems. I know that.

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,550
<14-4,RAY>两天前  我接到一个男人的电话
<14-4,RAY>I got a call two days ago from some guy

87
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,700
<14-4,RAY>说要找斯坦
<14-4,RAY>looking for Stan.

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,900
<14-4,RAY>他说斯坦欠他一万块
<14-4,RAY>Said that Stan owed him $10,000

89
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,480
<14-4,RAY>还说他最好还上
<14-4,RAY>and that he'd better pay

90
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,050
<14-4,RAY>不然走着瞧
<14-4,RAY>or else.

91
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,600
<14-4,RAY>斯坦的私人物品里没有关于蝴蝶的
<14-4,RAY>There's nothing in Stan's personal effects

92
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,480
<5-1,CASTLE>蓝色的  和其它颜色的都没有
<5-1,CASTLE>about butterflies, blue or otherwise.

93
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,470
<5-1,CASTLE>只有一堆书
<5-1,CASTLE>Just a bunch of books

94
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,980
<5-2,RYAN>讲的是40年代的黑帮和曼哈顿
<5-2,RYAN>about mobsters and Manhattan in the '40s.

95
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,160
<5-2,RYAN>没关系  我查到了
<5-2,RYAN>That's all right, because I got a hit

96
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,200
<5-3,BECKETT>给斯坦妻子打恐吓电话的人
<5-3,BECKETT>on that threatening money call to Stan's wife,

97
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,940
<5-3,BECKETT>结果发现是一家干洗店打来的
<5-3,BECKETT>and it turns out it came from a dry cleaners.

98
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,140
<5-4,RYAN>或许他们洗的不仅只有衣服
<5-4,RYAN>Maybe clothes aren't the only thing they're laundering.

99
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,080
<5-4,RYAN>我去查
<5-4,RYAN>I'll check it out.

100
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,760
<5-5,BECKETT>谢了
<5-5,BECKETT>Thanks.

101
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,580
<5-5,BECKETT>斯坦物品里的有本日记  也是40年代的
<5-5,BECKETT>Uh, this diary in Stan's stuff, it's also from the '40s.

102
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,110
<5-5,BECKETT>听起来像是私家侦探的
<5-5,BECKETT>It sounds like it belonged to a private eye.

103
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,810
<5-5,BECKETT>听听这段
<5-5,BECKETT>Listen to this.

104
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,960
<5-6,CASTLE>"通常来说  妻子们在看到
<5-6,CASTLE>"Usually wives turn on the waterworks

105
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,010
<5-6,CASTLE>丈夫出轨的照片时会泪如雨下
<5-6,CASTLE>when shown pictures of their husbands stepping out,

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,320
<5-6,CASTLE>可这个女人不同
<5-6,CASTLE>but not this dame.

107
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,910
<5-6,CASTLE>她要以牙还牙  那么哪一点更糟
<5-6,CASTLE>She wanted payback. So what's worse,

108
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,570
<5-6,CASTLE>是我与一位客户共赴巫山
<5-6,CASTLE>that I pitched woo with a client

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,930
<5-6,CASTLE>还是我在事后为所提供的服务给她开了发票"
<5-6,CASTLE>or that I invoiced her for services rendered after?"

110
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,250
<5-7,BECKETT>挺可爱
<5-7,BECKETT>Cute.

111
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,120
<5-7,BECKETT>可爱
<5-7,BECKETT>Cute?

112
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,190
<5-8,CASTLE>这家伙给人的感觉像个无情的私家侦探
<5-8,CASTLE>I mean, this guy sounds like a hard-boiled P.I.

114
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,680
<5-8,CASTLE>就跟雷蒙德·钱德勒的小说人物似的
<5-8,CASTLE>right out of a Raymond Chandler novel.

115
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,880
<5-8,CASTLE>不知道为什么斯坦有这个
<5-8,CASTLE>I wonder why Stan had this?

116
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,310
<5-8,CASTLE>贝克特
<5-8,CASTLE>Hey, yo, Beckett.

<5-9,ESPOSITO>Still got no word on that homeless guy,

118
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,070
<5-9,ESPOSITO>不过有个酒店老板看见一辆白色野马
<5-9,ESPOSITO>but a bodega owner saw a white Mustang

119
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,700
<5-9,ESPOSITO>停在俱乐部门外的卸货区
<5-9,ESPOSITO>parked in the loading zone right outside the club

<5-12,CASTLE>我今晚能把这个带回家吗
<5-12,CASTLE>Can I take this home for the night?

125
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,610
<5-12,CASTLE>或许通过这个能查到斯坦在找的东西
<5-12,CASTLE>I mean, it might be the key to what Stan was looking for.

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,320
<5-13,BECKETT>你只是因为觉得这个有意思才想看
<5-13,BECKETT>You just want to read it because you think it's cool.

127
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,610

<5-15,BECKETT>今天像往常一样开始
<5-15,BECKETT>The day began like every other,

132
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,800
<5-15,BECKETT>在我的办公椅上醒来
<5-15,BECKETT>pulling awake in my office chair

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,670
<5-15,BECKETT>拿着肯塔基香酒的瓶子
<5-15,BECKETT>with a cream of Kentucky bottle,

134
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,270
<5-15,BECKETT>感觉喉咙干涩
<5-15,BECKETT>A dry throat,

135
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,670
<5-15,BECKETT>脑袋疼得叮当作响
<5-15,BECKETT>and a head that was ringing like church bells.

136
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,890
<5-15,BECKETT>于是  我决定再喝点酒
<5-15,BECKETT>So I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone

137
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,710
<5-15,BECKETT>以消宿醉  一解饥渴"

<5-15,BECKETT>Why have an apartment

140
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,950
<5-15,BECKETT>醉死过去  还要公寓干什么
<5-15,BECKETT>when you drink yourself to sleep in the office every night?

141
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,210
<5-15,BECKETT>那样的话  我就永远不会迟到了
<5-15,BECKETT>That way, I'm never late for work.

<25-15,CASTLE>我劝我丈夫到纽约来度蜜月
<25-15,CASTLE>I-I talked my husband into honeymoonin' up here in the big apple,

160
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,710
<25-16,JERRY>可不是因为我想上摩天大楼
<25-16,JERRY>but not because I wanted to climb skyscrapers

161
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,780
<25-17,CASTLE>看百老汇表演
<25-17,CASTLE>and see broadway shows.

162
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,370

<28-6,RYAN>There was bad blood back home,

166
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
<28-7,ESPOSITO>两年前薇拉离家出走
<28-7,ESPOSITO>and Vera ran off two years ago

167
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,240
<28-8,WALLY>梦想在这样的大都市里做一个歌舞女郎
<28-8,WALLY>with dreams of being a showgirl up here in the big city.

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,100
<25-13,JERRY>如我之前所说  我们家庭不和
<25-13,JERRY>Like I said, there's bad blood back home,

178
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,900
<25-14,BECKETT>如果薇拉从陌生人口中得知
<25-14,BECKETT>and if Vera hears from a stranger

179
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,190
<25-15,CASTLE>家人在寻找她
<25-15,CASTLE>that the family's looking for her,

180
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,140
<25-16,JERRY>或许她会逃得更远
<25-16,JERRY>it might push her farther away.

181
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,300

<25-17,CASTLE>Looking at that photograph, all I could think was,

185
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,630
<25-17,CASTLE>多么美的女人
<25-17,CASTLE>what a beautiful doll.

187
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,580
<28-1,RYAN>或许她实现了自己的愿望
<28-1,RYAN>Maybe she made it.

188
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,810
<28-2,WALLY>那也不会是这城市里最奇怪的事情
<28-2,WALLY>Stranger things have happened in this town.

<29-8,CLYDE>I was hoping my favorite performer Satchmo was blowing."

191
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,700
<29-9,BECKETT>但是似乎没有这么好运
<29-9,BECKETT>But no such luck.

192
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,450
<29-9,BECKETT>但是我并不抱怨
<29-9,BECKETT>Couldn't complain, though,

193
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,520
<29-9,BECKETT>因为站在台上的是贝西·辛克莱
<29-9,BECKETT>because Betsy Sin clair was up there,

194
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,590

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,860
<27-2,JERRY>我屁股里的弹片都要闹了
<27-2,JERRY>didn't get the shrapnel in my hip buzzing.

198
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,040
<27-2,JERRY>幸好我知道哪里能找到我的解药"
<27-2,JERRY>But I knew where to get my medicine."

199
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,400
<20-1,RYAN>说不定你能助我一臂之力  我在找个女人
<20-1,RYAN>Say, maybe you can help me. I'm lookin' for a dame.

204
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,670
<20-6,CASTLE>我怎么才遇见你
<20-6,CASTLE>And where have you been all my life?

207
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,840
<22-3,BECKETT>我一直告诉自己不要盯着她看
<22-3,BECKETT>I kept telling myself to look away.

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,070
<7-2,DEMPSEY>小心说话  否则割了你的舌头
<7-2,DEMPSEY>Hold your tongue, or I'll cut it out.

222
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:10,930
<7-2,DEMPSEY>耍聪明啊
<7-2,DEMPSEY>Mm, a wise guy.

223
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,150
<7-2,DEMPSEY>我讨厌耍聪明的人
<7-2,DEMPSEY>I hate wise guys

224
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,490
<7-2,DEMPSEY>就像我讨厌那些盯着我的女人看的废物
<7-2,DEMPSEY>about as much as I hate crumbs eyeballing my girl.

225
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,600
<7-2,DEMPSEY>这很粗鲁  没有礼貌
<7-2,DEMPSEY>It's rude, uncivil.

226
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,740
<7-2,DEMPSEY>不过没有关系  朋友
<7-2,DEMPSEY>That's all right, friend.

227
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,300
<7-2,DEMPSEY>我的手下会好好调教你的
<7-2,DEMPSEY>The boys are gonna teach you some lessons.

228
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,180
<20-3,RYAN>好了  臭小子  第一课
<20-3,RYAN>Okay, boy-o, first lesson.

229
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,230
<20-4,CASTLE>来  抓住他
<20-4,CASTLE>Over here. Get him.

230
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,420
<20-5,RYAN>"就这样
<20-5,RYAN>"There I was,

231
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,200
<20-6,CASTLE>挂着一身的残羹冷炙
<20-6,CASTLE>covered in the discards of the blue plate special,

232
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,190
<20-7,RYAN>我问自己  这么做值还是不值
<20-7,RYAN>asking myself, 'was it worth it?

233
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,000
<20-8,CASTLE>绝对值
<20-8,CASTLE>It was.

234
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,300
<20-9,RYAN>为了她不论怎么挨打都是值得的"
<20-9,RYAN>She was worth every punch."

235
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,470
<9-5,BECKETT>你受伤了吗
<9-5,BECKETT>Are you hurt?

236
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,620
<30-7,BECKETT>这点伤吗
<30-7,BECKETT>What, this?

237
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,360
<30-8,CASTLE>根本不算什么
<30-8,CASTLE>It's nothin'.

238
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,340
<23-7,CASTLE>你该看看我的脸把那家伙的拳头伤得多厉害
<23-7,CASTLE>You should see what my face did to the other guy's fist.

239
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,640
<23-8,BECKETT>那你叫什么名字  硬汉
<23-8,BECKETT>So what's your name, tough guy?

240
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,410
<25-8,BECKETT>这要紧吗  美人
<25-8,BECKETT>Does it matter, doll?

241
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,570
<25-9,JERRY>薇拉
<25-9,JERRY>Vera!

242
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,950
<25-10,BECKETT>你知道你戴着老大的东西
<25-10,BECKETT>You know you're not supposed to leave our sight

243
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,250
<25-11,JERRY>不能离开我们的视线
<25-11,JERRY>with the boss' hardware on.

244
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,990
<25-12,BECKETT>那个蓝蝴蝶
<25-12,BECKETT>The blue butterfly.

245
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,910
<25-12,BECKETT>是一条项链
<25-12,BECKETT>It's a necklace.

246
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,520
<25-12,BECKETT>这就是斯坦·班克斯被杀的原因
<25-12,BECKETT>That's why Stan Banks was killed.

247
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,610
<25-12,BECKETT>我干嘛要独白啊
<25-12,BECKETT>Why am I narrating?

257
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,540
<25-12,BECKETT>干洗店的勒索电话有什么线索了吗
<25-12,BECKETT>So anything on that threatening call to the dry cleaners?

258
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,460
<25-12,BECKETT>店主说他根本不知道斯坦
<25-12,BECKETT>Yeah, the owner claims he doesn't know anything about Stan

259
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,140
<25-12,BECKETT>或者什么蓝蝴蝶
<25-12,BECKETT>or blue butterflies.

260
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,090
<9-1,BECKETT>但是一个叫雷·霍顿的人租用了后面的房间
<9-1,BECKETT>However, a guy named Ray Horton rents out a back room.

261
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,470
<9-2,RYAN>而且雷是正在假释中的收注人
<9-2,RYAN>Turns out Ray is a bookie on parole.

262
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,010
<9-2,RYAN>可能斯坦跟雷约在佩尼贝克见面
<9-2,RYAN>Okay, so maybe Stan was trying to meet Ray at the Pennybaker

263
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,350
<9-3,BECKETT>为了偿还他的赌债
<9-3,BECKETT>so that he could pay off some debts?

264
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,940
<9-3,BECKETT>斯坦去那里不是为了还债
<9-3,BECKETT>Uh, Stan was not there because of his debt.

265
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,320
<9-3,BECKETT>他去那里也不是为了哪只蓝蝴蝶
<9-3,BECKETT>He was not even there about a blue butterfly.

266
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,950
<9-3,BECKETT>而是为了那条蓝蝴蝶
<9-3,BECKETT>He was there about the blue butterfly.

267
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,240
<9-4,CASTLE>是一条项链
<9-4,CASTLE>It's a necklace.

268
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,830
<9-4,CASTLE>一个蝴蝶图案的装饰品  完全由
<9-4,CASTLE>A butterfly-shaped centerpiece made entirely of...

269
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,020
<9-4,CASTLE>蓝钻镶嵌
<9-4,CASTLE>blue diamonds

270
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,740
<9-5,BECKETT>价值轻松达到一百万
<9-5,BECKETT>worth about a million dollars, easy.

271
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,140
<9-5,BECKETT>你是从哪发现这些的
<9-5,BECKETT>Where are you getting all of this?

272
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,170
<9-6,CASTLE>从那个私家侦探的日记
<9-6,CASTLE>Fron whe P.I.'s diary.

273
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,710
<9-6,CASTLE>所以斯坦是在寻找宝物了
<9-6,CASTLE>So Stan was on a treasure hunt.

274
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,930
<9-7,RYAN>正是  我还做了一个小调查
<9-7,RYAN>Exactly. I did a little research.

275
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,970
<9-8,CASTLE>这个蓝蝴蝶宝石在四十年代时失踪了
<9-8,CASTLE>It turns out the blue butterfly disappeared sometime in the '40s,

276
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,610
<9-8,CASTLE>有传言说  它藏在佩尼贝克俱乐部的某处
<9-8,CASTLE>And rumor has it, it's hidden somewhere in the Pennybaker club.

277
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
<9-8,CASTLE>如果他找到了它
<9-8,CASTLE>If he found it...

278
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,090
<9-8,CASTLE>价值百万的项链  杀人动机不是很明显了么
<9-8,CASTLE>A million-dollar necklace? Talk about motive for murder.

279
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,400
<9-8,CASTLE>对了  莱恩  说小子
<9-8,CASTLE>By the way, Ryan, say boy-o.

280
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,010
<9-9,RYAN>-小子  -小子
<9-9,RYAN>- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

281
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,010
<9-9,RYAN>-小子  -小子
<9-9,RYAN>- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

282
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,140
<9-9,RYAN>-小子  -小子
<9-9,RYAN>- Boy- o. - Boy-o.

283
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,270
<9-11,RYAN>-小子  -算了
<9-11,RYAN>- Boy- o. - Anyway.

284
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,090
<9-14,CASTLE>在网上搜索了一下
<9-14,CASTLE>Did some searching on the net.

285
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,200
<9-16,CASTLE>相关信息并不多
<9-16,CASTLE>There wasn't a lot there.

286
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,000
<9-16,CASTLE>但是我发现  项链据说被诅咒了
<9-16,CASTLE>But I found, it's supposedly cursed,

287
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,580
<9-16,CASTLE>曾经属于某位纳粹党卫军官员的情妇
<9-16,CASTLE>and at one time belonged to an S.S. Officer's mistress.

288
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,680
<9-16,CASTLE>战后  项链流入到美国
<9-16,CASTLE>After the war, made its way stateside

289
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,910
<9-16,CASTLE>到了黑帮大佬汤姆·丹普西的手里
<9-16,CASTLE>and into the hands of mob boss Tom Dempsey,

290
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
<9-16,CASTLE>同时也是这家俱乐部的主人  因此我们得回去
<9-16,CASTLE>who owned the club, which is why we need to go back.

291
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
<9-17,BECKETT>-我们要回去  -是的
<9-17,BECKETT>- We do? - Yeah.

292
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,070
<9-18,CASTLE>你还记得我们在斯坦手里找到的绿色铁棒么
<9-18,CASTLE>You remember the, uh, green rod we found in Stan's hand?

293
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,190
<9-18,CASTLE>丹普西俱乐部楼下的办公室
<9-18,CASTLE>Apparently, Dempsey's downstairs office

294
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,100
<9-18,CASTLE>涂了酢浆草绿色的漆
<9-18,CASTLE>was painted shamrock green.

295
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,790
<9-18,CASTLE>斯坦肯定下去过
<9-18,CASTLE>Stan had to have gone down there.

296
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,580
<9-18,CASTLE>而且根据日记  蓝蝴蝶正是被保存在
<9-18,CASTLE>Also, according to the diary, the blue butterfly was kept

297
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,960
<9-18,CASTLE>丹普西办公室的秘密保险箱里
<9-18,CASTLE>in a secret safe in Dempsey's office.

298
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,570
<9-18,CASTLE>我们很可能漏掉了什么
<9-18,CASTLE>It's very possible we missed something.

299
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,810
<9-18,CASTLE>因为我们根本没有好好地看过那里
<9-18,CASTLE>We never really looked down there.

300
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,110
<9-19,BECKETT>莱恩  你继续追查看能否找到那个收注人
<9-19,BECKETT>Okay, Ryan, you see if you can get ahold of the bookie.

301
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,930
<9-19,BECKETT>-卡塞尔和我会去犯罪现场  -好的
<9-19,BECKETT>- Castle and I will go back to the crime scene. - Okay.

302
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,590
<9-8,CASTLE>-小子  -小子
<9-8,CASTLE>- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

303
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,440
<9-9,RYAN>-小子  -小子
<9-9,RYAN>- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

305
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,570
<9-25,CASTLE>-发音要像小妖精一样  -卡塞尔
<9-25,CASTLE>- Like a leprechaun. - Castle.

306
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,360
<9-25,CASTLE>抱歉
<9-25,CASTLE>Sorry.

307
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,050
<10-1,CASTLE>私家侦探告诉莎莉
<10-1,CASTLE>So the P.I. tells Sally

308
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,100
<10-1,CASTLE>她在佩尼贝克俱乐部找到了她姐姐
<10-1,CASTLE>that he found her sister here at the Pennybaker club.

309
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,530
<10-2,BECKETT>莎莉有去找她姐姐吗
<10-2,BECKETT>And did Sally go talk to her sister?

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,340
<10-3,CASTLE>没有  乔认为莎莉
<10-3,CASTLE>Well, no. Joe could tell that Sally,

311
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,880
<10-3,CASTLE>这样一个来自乡下的单纯的女孩
<10-3,CASTLE>being an innocent girl from the country,

312
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,900
<10-3,CASTLE>她与黑帮打交道会无所适从
<10-3,CASTLE>she was a little bit nervous about dealing with mobsters,

313
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,860
<10-3,CASTLE>因此他自愿回去联系薇拉
<10-3,CASTLE>So he offered to go back and make contact with Vera.

314
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,400
<10-4,BECKETT>我敢肯定他是出自好心
<10-4,BECKETT>Out of the goodness of his heart, I'm sure.

315
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,270
<10-5,CASTLE>你能怪他吗  我是说  她太美了
<10-5,CASTLE>Can you blame the guy? I mean, she was gorgeous.

316
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,880
<10-5,CASTLE>不管怎样  乔告诉莎莉他会安排她们会面
<10-5,CASTLE>So anyway, Joe tells Sally he's gonna go arrange a meeting.

317
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,990
<10-6,CASTLE>莎莉同意了  但再次坚持乔不要告诉薇拉
<10-6,CASTLE>Sally agreed, but again, insisted that Joe not tell Vera

318
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,860
<10-6,CASTLE>是她在找她
<10-6,CASTLE>that she was looking for her

319
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,840
<10-6,CASTLE>因为家里那些宿怨的缘故
<10-6,CASTLE>because of all the animosity back home.

320
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,920
<10-7,CASTLE>我是对的
<10-7,CASTLE>Ah. I was right.

321
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,840
<10-7,CASTLE>我打赌这就是他拿到那根铁棒的地方
<10-7,CASTLE>I bet that's where he got the steel rod,

322
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,070
<10-7,CASTLE>他可能是想用来撬开秘密保险箱
<10-7,CASTLE>which is probably what he used to pry open the secret safe.

323
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,940
<10-8,BECKETT>我也不想戳破你的美梦  卡塞尔
<10-8,BECKETT>Hate to burst bubbles, Castle,

324
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,160
<10-8,BECKETT>但是这个已经很多年没放过东西了
<10-8,BECKETT>but this hasn't held anything in years.

325
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,660
<10-9,BECKETT>看来斯坦失望而归了
<10-9,BECKETT>Looks like Stan was disappointed.

326
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,440
<10-10,CASTLE>是的  如果那就是秘密保险箱他或许会失望
<10-10,CASTLE>Yeah, he probably would've been if that was the secret safe.

327
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,930
<10-11,BECKETT>那不是秘密保险箱吗
<10-11,BECKETT>That's not the secret safe?

328
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,270
<10-12,CASTLE>告诉你一个有趣的事实
<10-12,CASTLE>Here's a fun fact--

329
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,610
<10-12,CASTLE>人们通常有两个保险箱
<10-12,CASTLE>people often kept two safes,

330
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,390
<10-12,CASTLE>一个放些价值不高的东西  且容易被找到
<10-12,CASTLE>one that was easy to find for minor valuables,

331
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,220
<10-12,CASTLE>另一个就没那么容易找到了
<10-12,CASTLE>and a second safe that was much harder to locate

332
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,840
<10-12,CASTLE>放着更贵重的东西  比如蓝蝴蝶
<10-12,CASTLE>for the extra specials, like blue butterflies.

333
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,940
<10-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  秘密保险箱在哪里
<10-13,BECKETT>Castle, where's the secret safe?

334
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,870
<10-14,CASTLE>马上就说到
<10-14,CASTLE>Coming to that.

335
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,540
<10-14,CASTLE>乔和薇拉相识已经五天了
<10-14,CASTLE>So it's five days since Joe and Vera met.

336
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,020
<10-14,CASTLE>而他们已经深深地爱上了对方
<10-14,CASTLE>And they were very much in love.

337
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,310
<10-15,BECKETT>只过了五天  拜托
<10-15,BECKETT>After only five days? Come on.

338
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,120
<10-16,CASTLE>在40年代人们不浪费一点时间
<10-16,CASTLE>Well, people didn't waste time back in the '40s.

339
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,410
<10-16,CASTLE>事实上  他们情到深处
<10-16,CASTLE>Matter of fact, they were so much in love...

340
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
<10-16,CASTLE>已然不顾一切了
<10-16,CASTLE>well, they risked it all.

341
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,430
<10-17,BECKETT>那这和我们的秘密保险箱有什么关系
<10-17,BECKETT>So what does that have to do with our secret safe?

342
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,400
<10-18,CASTLE>一切就发生在后台
<10-18,CASTLE>And it happened backstage...

343
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,530
<11-1,CASTLE>就在楼上
<11-1,CASTLE>right upstairs.

344
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,680
<11-1,CASTLE>他们两人正在幽会
<11-1,CASTLE>They were stealing a moment together,

345
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,790
<11-1,CASTLE>这很危险  因为她是丹普西的女人
<11-1,CASTLE>which was dangerous, because she was Dempsey's girl.

346
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,140
<11-1,CASTLE>当他们四目相对之时
<11-1,CASTLE>As they stared into each other's eyes,

347
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,180
<11-1,CASTLE>凯特心跳加快
<11-1,CASTLE>Kate's heart quickened.

348
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,330
<11-2,BECKETT>你刚是不是说了"凯特"
<11-2,BECKETT>Did you just say "Kate"?

349
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,050
<11-2,BECKETT>你是不是把自己想象成私家侦探
<11-2,BECKETT>Are you picturing the PI as you

350
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,700
<11-2,BECKETT>把我想象成黑老大的情妇
<11-2,BECKETT>and me as the gangster's moll?

351
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,660
<11-2,BECKETT>什么  没有
<11-2,BECKETT>What? No.

352
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,470
<11-2,BECKETT>我没有说"凯特"
<11-2,BECKETT>And I didn't say "Kate."

353
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,400
<12-2,CASTLE>我说的是"命运"  "命运的心跳加快"
<12-2,CASTLE>I said "Fate." "Fate's heart quickened."

354
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,050
<12-2,CASTLE>我只是想诗意一点  老天
<12-2,CASTLE>I was being poetic. God.

355
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,910
<12-2,CASTLE>总之就如我所说的
<12-2,CASTLE>Anyway, as I was saying,

356
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,790
<12-2,CASTLE>正当他们要接吻的时候
<12-2,CASTLE>they were just about to kiss when...

357
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,620
<12-2,CASTLE>嘿呦  臭小子
<12-2,CASTLE>Oye, chico!

358
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,790
<12-2,CASTLE>是谁
<12-2,CASTLE>Who's that?

359
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,620
<12-2,CASTLE>怎么了  小子  没长教训啊
<12-2,CASTLE>Hey, boy-o. You must be a slow learner.

360
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,870
<12-2,CASTLE>我的宝贝原来这这里
<12-2,CASTLE>There's my baby.

361
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,650
<12-2,CASTLE>他和你是一对吗  辛克莱小姐
<12-2,CASTLE>He's with you, Miss Sinclair?

362
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,020
<12-2,CASTLE>是的
<12-2,CASTLE>Yes,

363
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,920
<12-2,CASTLE>而且你们那天晚上
<12-2,CASTLE>and I don't appreciate you lugs

364
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,950
<14-1,ESPOSITO>打得他满地找牙  我很生气
<14-1,ESPOSITO>mopping the floor with him the other night.

365
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,070
<14-2,RAY HORTON>不是没原因的  但你得低调一点
<14-2,RAY HORTON>Not for nothin', but you need to keep this on the hush-hush.

366
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,790
<14-3,RYAN>丹普西不喜欢黑白配
<14-3,RYAN>Dempsey's not too keen about mixed laundry.

367
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,710
<13-2,CASTLE>那就作为我们之间的小秘密
<13-2,CASTLE>Well, then we'll just keep this our little secret.

368
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,450
<13-3,BECKETT>你们说呢
<13-3,BECKETT>What do you say?

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,660
<17-1,CASTLE>好了  伙计们
<17-1,CASTLE>All right, fellas.

370
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,510
<17-2,RYAN>你最好放聪明一点  薇拉
<17-2,RYAN>You better wise up, Vera.

371
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
<17-3,CASTLE>如果被丹普西发现他会把你大卸八块的
<17-3,CASTLE>Dempsey will have you butchered if he finds out.

372
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,110
<17-4,RYAN>他虽说吻技了得
<17-4,RYAN>I mean, he's a hell of a smoocher and all,

373
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,830
<17-5,CASTLE>但是该死的  姑娘
<17-5,CASTLE>but, damn it, girl,

374
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,530
<17-1,CASTLE>这小白脸真值得你如此吗
<17-1,CASTLE>is this yum-yum really worth it?

375
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,980
<17-1,CASTLE>他就是我的心头肉
<17-1,CASTLE>He's the cream in my coffee.

376
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,300
<17-1,CASTLE>你俩真像故事里的主角
<17-1,CASTLE>You two are a walking fairy tale.

377
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,020
<24-1,BECKETT>我的老天爷
<24-1,BECKETT>Good lord.

378
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,620
<24-2,ESPOSITO>走吧
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Come on.

379
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,630
<24-3,BECKETT>要知道贝西说得对
<24-3,BECKETT>Betsy's right, you know?

380
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,990
<24-4,CASTLE>丹普西发现我们的事  定会杀了我们
<24-4,CASTLE>Dempsey will scrag us for sure if he catches us turtle-doving.

381
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,790
<24-4,CASTLE>你必须要带我离开这儿  乔
<24-4,CASTLE>You gotta get me away from here, Joe,

382
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,160
<25-1,FRANKIE>离开丹普西  离开这一切
<25-1,FRANKIE>away from Dempsey, away from all of it.

383
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,880
<25-2,JERRY MADDOX>然后去哪里呢  我们能逃得了一时
<25-2,JERRY MADDOX>Oh, yeah, and go where? We can blow this town, sure.

384
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,940
<23-2,CASTLE>等到我们身无分文的时候还能逃多远呢
<23-2,CASTLE>Only how far are we gonna get when we're both flat broke?

385
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,740
<23-3,TOM>我们不会的  乔
<23-3,TOM>We're not broke, Joe.

386
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,650
<29-2,CLYDE>我脖子上戴的东西远远超过我们所需要的了
<29-2,CLYDE>We've got all the money we need and more around my neck.

387
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:31,460
<29-3,CASTLE>我们只要带着它走就足够了
<29-3,CASTLE>All we gotta do is take it away with us.

388
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,890
<29-4,CLYDE>什么  你疯了吗
<29-4,CLYDE>What, are you daffy?

389
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,680
<29-5,BECKETT>你戴着它的时候起码有两个保镖
<29-5,BECKETT>You got at least two Brunos with you at all times

390
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
<25-5,BECKETT>跟着你形影不离
<25-5,BECKETT>when you're wearing that thing.

391
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,010
<25-6,CASTLE>说来也好笑
<25-6,CASTLE>It's funny.

392
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,080
<25-7,JERRY>当我还是个卖烟女的时候
<25-7,JERRY>Back when I was a cigarette girl,

393
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,110
<25-8,BECKETT>我看到丹普西和他的女友
<25-8,BECKETT>I'd watch Dempsey coming in with his girlfriend

394
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,700
<25-9,JERRY>脖子上戴着它走进来
<25-9,JERRY>wearing this thing around her neck,

395
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,000
<25-10,BECKETT>我想得到它
<25-10,BECKETT>and I wanted it.

396
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
<25-11,JERRY>没过多久  我成为了他的女人我也得到了它
<25-11,JERRY>Pretty soon, I was his girl and I had it.

397
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,550
<25-12,BECKETT>但这不只是一个项链  它是一个钻石做的枷锁
<25-12,BECKETT>But it's not a necklace, Joe. It's a diamond noose,

398
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,010
<25-12,BECKETT>而我越来越喘不过气了
<25-12,BECKETT>and it's getting harder to breathe.

399
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,380
<25-12,BECKETT>那我们就要把这个枷锁变成救命索
<25-12,BECKETT>Then we gotta turn that noose into a lifeline.

400
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,450
<25-12,BECKETT>问题是怎样变
<25-12,BECKETT>The question is, how?

401
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,130
<25-12,BECKETT>我不戴时  丹普西把它放在一个秘密保险箱里
<25-12,BECKETT>When I'm not wearing it, Dempsey keeps it in a secret safe,

402
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,590
<25-12,BECKETT>而我知道在哪里
<25-12,BECKETT>and I know where it is.

403
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,070
<25-12,BECKETT>然后呢
<25-12,BECKETT>And?

404
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,690
<25-12,BECKETT>然后
<25-12,BECKETT>And...

405
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,200
<25-12,BECKETT>就没了
<25-12,BECKETT>that's it.

406
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,560
<13-1,BECKETT>这是日记的最后一篇
<13-1,BECKETT>That was the last entry in the diary.

407
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,990
<13-2,CASTLE>什么叫没了  那乔怎么样了
<13-2,CASTLE>What do you mean, that's it? What happened to Joe?

408
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,050
<13-3,BECKETT>-薇拉怎么样了  -我不知道
<13-3,BECKETT>- What happened to Vera? - I don't know.

409
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,530
<13-4,CASTLE>你不知道结局为什么还要告诉我这个故事
<13-4,CASTLE>Well, why would you tell a story when you don't know the ending?

410
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,670
<13-5,BECKETT>如果你想听有头有尾的故事
<13-5,BECKETT>If you wanted a beginning and a middle and an end,

411
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,270
<13-6,CASTLE>我有27本小说供你选择
<13-6,CASTLE>I have 27 novels you can choose from.

412
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,930
<13-7,BECKETT>好吧  那这个秘密保险箱在哪里
<13-7,BECKETT>Okay, so where is this secret safe?

413
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,740
<13-7,BECKETT>我不知道  但我认为斯坦肯定找到了
<13-7,BECKETT>I don't know, but I think Stan must have found it.

414
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,520
<13-8,CASTLE>也许这就是他需要那根棒子的原因
<13-8,CASTLE>Maybe that's why he needed that rod,

415
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,330
<13-8,CASTLE>为了撬开一面墙什么的
<13-8,CASTLE>to pry open a wall or something.

416
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,040
<13-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看这个板条
<13-9,BECKETT>Castle, look at the molding.

417
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,260
<13-9,BECKETT>怎么回事
<13-9,BECKETT>What...

418
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,050
<13-9,BECKETT>没有锁上
<13-9,BECKETT>It's unlocked.

419
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,410
<13-9,BECKETT>斯坦找到了
<13-9,BECKETT>Stan found it.

420
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,270
<13-10,CASTLE>所以他才被杀了
<13-10,CASTLE>That's why he was killed.

421
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,670
<13-10,CASTLE>但谁杀了他呢
<13-10,CASTLE>But by whom?

422
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,470
<14-1,ESPOSITO>雷·霍顿
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Ray Horton.

423
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,190
<14-1,ESPOSITO>伤人  斗殴  而现在你用干洗店
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Assault, battery, and now you're using a dry cleaners

424
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,130
<14-1,ESPOSITO>做你赌博生意的幌子
<14-1,ESPOSITO>to front your bookmaking operation.

425
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,510
<14-2,RAY HORTON>等等  慢点
<14-2,RAY HORTON>Whoa. Slow your roll.

426
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,000
<14-2,RAY HORTON>我这样的假释犯是不能搀和赌博的
<14-2,RAY HORTON>A man on parole like myself can't be mixed up in bookmaking.

427
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,620
<14-3,RYAN>那凶杀呢  雷
<14-3,RYAN>How about murder, Ray?

428
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,190
<14-3,RYAN>你能搀和凶杀吗
<14-3,RYAN>Is it okay to get mixed up in that?

429
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,480
<14-3,RYAN>斯坦
<14-3,RYAN>Stan?

430
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,270
<14-4,RAY>是谁杀了他
<14-4,RAY>And who--who killed him?

431
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,530
<14-4,RAY>我吗
<14-4,RAY>Me?

432
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,800
<14-5,RAY>我为什么要杀我的合伙人
<14-5,RAY>Why would I kill my business partner?

433
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,560
<14-6,ESPOSITO>你的合伙人  别扯了
<14-6,ESPOSITO>Your business partner? Come on.

434
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,690
<14-7,RAY>是真的  老兄
<14-7,RAY>It's true, man.

435
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,720
<14-7,RAY>是我的一个客户介绍的
<14-7,RAY>One of my clients hooked us up.

436
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,570
<14-7,RAY>他知道我想扩大投资
<14-7,RAY>He knew that I was looking to diversify

437
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,710
<14-7,RAY>而斯坦需要资金去找一条失踪的项链
<14-7,RAY>and that Stan needed financing to find this lost necklace.

438
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,930
<14-7,RAY>斯坦告诉我他需要一万块的开销
<14-7,RAY>Stan told me he needed 10 g's for expenses

439
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,500
<14-7,RAY>去买一个旧私家侦探的日记
<14-7,RAY>and to buy this old private detective's diary.

440
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,270
<14-7,RAY>所以我同意出资赞助他  分一半利润
<14-7,RAY>So I agreed to back him for half the profits.

441
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,920
<14-8,RYAN>如果这是真的  你为什么要威胁斯坦的妻子
<14-8,RYAN>Well, if that's true, then why did you threaten Stan's wife?

442
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,110
<14-9,RAY>因为斯坦躲着我  我以为我被耍了
<14-9,RAY>Because Stan was ducking me. I thought I got played.

443
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,740
<14-9,RAY>两天以后他找到我
<14-9,RAY>Then he came up to me two days ago,

444
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,020
<14-9,RAY>告诉我了来龙去脉
<14-9,RAY>and he told me what was up.

445
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,970
<14-9,RAY>他说他找到了那个能补全蓝蝴蝶之谜
<14-9,RAY>He said he found the man with the missing piece

446
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,660
<14-9,RAY>缺失的线索的人
<14-9,RAY>of the puzzle to the blue butterfly.

447
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,400
<14-10,RYAN>-那个人是谁  -我不知道
<14-10,RYAN>- And who's this man? - I don't know.

448
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,130
<14-11,RAY>但是如果斯坦找到了蓝蝴蝶
<14-11,RAY>But if Stan found the blue butterfly,

449
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,900
<14-11,RAY>大概就是这个人杀了他
<14-11,RAY>that's probably who killed him.

450
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,830
<15-1,CASTLE>我追查了那本日记  斯坦调查得很深入
<15-1,CASTLE>So I traced the diary. Stan did his research.

451
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,830
<15-1,CASTLE>他从乔以前的秘书的孙女手中
<15-1,CASTLE>He purchased it from the granddaughter

452
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,700
<15-1,CASTLE>买下了这本日记
<15-1,CASTLE>of Joe's old secretary,

453
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,290
<15-1,CASTLE>一个叫做露丝·亨特沙克的女人
<15-1,CASTLE>A woman by the name of Ruth Huntsacker.

454
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,060
<15-2,BECKETT>那又怎样
<15-2,BECKETT>So?

455
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,760
<15-3,CASTLE>我和亨特沙克太太谈过
<15-3,CASTLE>So I spoke to Mrs. Huntsacker.

456
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,600
<15-3,CASTLE>她说她可能还有私家侦探的一些旧文件
<15-3,CASTLE>she said, she might still have some of the PI's old papers

457
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,120
<15-3,CASTLE>也许那些文件能告诉我们到底发生了什么
<15-3,CASTLE>and they might be able to tell us what happened.

458
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,240
<15-3,CASTLE>她会让她儿子找找看
<15-3,CASTLE>She's gonna have her son look for them

459
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,740
<15-3,CASTLE>然后再联系我
<15-3,CASTLE>and then call me back.

460
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,050
<15-4,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔  我承认乔和薇拉的故事
<15-4,BECKETT>Look, Castle, I admit that Joe and Vera's story

461
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,820
<15-4,BECKETT>很有趣也很浪漫
<15-4,BECKETT>is fun and romantic,

462
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,050
<15-4,BECKETT>但是发生在1947年的事情
<15-4,BECKETT>but whatever happened back in 1947

463
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,440
<15-4,BECKETT>和斯坦的凶手没有一点关系
<15-4,BECKETT>has nothing to do with who murdered Stan.

464
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,740
<15-5,RYAN>这我可不确定
<15-5,RYAN>Uh... I'm not so sure about that.

465
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,970
<15-5,RYAN>收注人的不在场证明证实了
<15-5,RYAN>Our bookie alibied out.

466
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,780
<15-5,RYAN>但弹道报告出来了  我们找到了匹配结果
<15-5,RYAN>But ballistics came in, and we got a match.

467
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,900
<15-5,RYAN>杀死斯坦的点38口径左轮手枪
<15-5,RYAN>The 38-caliber revolver that killed Stan

468
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,650
<15-5,RYAN>曾一枪夺两命  案子至今未破
<15-5,RYAN>was used in an unsolved double homicide

469
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,580
<15-5,RYAN>而且那是1947年
<15-5,RYAN>in 1947.

470
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,800
<15-6,CASTLE>我就知道两者有联系
<15-6,CASTLE>I knew there was a connection.

471
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,830
<15-7,BECKETT>死者都是谁
<15-7,BECKETT>Who were the victims?

472
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,060
<15-8,RYAN>一个叫做薇拉·莫奎恩的女子
<15-8,RYAN>Uh, some lady named vera mulqueen

473
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,240
<15-8,RYAN>和一个叫做乔·弗林私家侦探
<15-8,RYAN>and a private detective named Joe Flynn.

474
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,600
<15-8,RYAN>被杀
<15-8,RYAN>Murdered.

475
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,100
<16-1,CASTLE>真是太惨了
<16-1,CASTLE>That's too bad.

476
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,350
<16-1,CASTLE>我真的以为那对疯狂的恋人能逃出生天呢
<16-1,CASTLE>I really thought those two crazy kids were gonna make it.

477
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,540
<16-2,BECKETT>是啊  确实不是我所期待的结局
<16-2,BECKETT>Yeah, not exactly the ending I was hoping for.

478
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,280
<16-3,CASTLE>我都不知道那么早就有弹道报告了
<16-3,CASTLE>I didn't even know ballistics went back that far.

479
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,470
<16-4,BECKETT>是啊  从二十年代就有了
<16-4,BECKETT>Oh, yeah. Since the 20s.

480
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,740
<16-5,RYAN>案子毕竟有年月了  系统里的资料有限
<16-5,RYAN>Being that it's an old case, there's not much in the system.

481
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,560
<16-5,RYAN>乔·弗林和薇拉·莫奎恩的遗骸
<16-5,RYAN>The remains of Joe Flynn and Vera Mulqueen

482
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,650
<16-5,RYAN>被发现时在弗林的车里
<16-5,RYAN>were found in Flynn's car.

483
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,920
<16-5,RYAN>就停在佩尼贝克俱乐部的后巷
<16-5,RYAN>It was parked in the ally of the Pennybaker club.

484
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,140
<16-5,RYAN>两名死者都是被38口径左轮手枪打死
<16-5,RYAN>Both victims were shot with a .38 revolver

485
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,900
<16-5,RYAN>车被人点着了
<16-5,RYAN>and the car was set on fire.

486
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,350
<16-5,RYAN>唯一的嫌疑人是汤姆·丹普西
<16-5,RYAN>Only suspect was Tom Dempsey,

487
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,090
<16-5,RYAN>但找不到足够证据拘捕他
<16-5,RYAN>but there was never enough evidence to arrest.

488
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,140
<16-6,BECKETT>我敢说是丹普西发现他们两人
<16-6,BECKETT>You know what? I bet you Dempsey caught the two of them

489
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,200
<16-6,BECKETT>预谋一起逃跑  就杀了他俩
<16-6,BECKETT>trying to run away together, and he killed them.

490
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,360
<16-6,BECKETT>但是斯坦的凶手是怎么
<16-6,BECKETT>But how does Stan's killer

491
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,850
<16-6,BECKETT>在六十年后拿到丹普西的枪呢
<16-6,BECKETT>get Dempsey's gun 60 years later?

492
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,290
<16-7,RYAN>除非...
<16-7,RYAN>Unless...

493
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,810
<16-7,RYAN>就是丹普西杀了斯坦
<16-7,RYAN>Dempsey killed Stan.

494
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,820
<16-7,RYAN>他现在该有九十了吧  不过也是有可能的
<16-7,RYAN>He'd be, what, like 90 years old, but it's still possible?

495
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,260
<16-8,CASTLE>不可能是丹普西
<16-8,CASTLE>Couldn't have been Dempsey.

496
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,210
<16-8,CASTLE>他死于心脏病
<16-8,CASTLE>He died of a heart attack

497
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,220
<16-8,CASTLE>就在乔和薇拉被杀后四个月
<16-8,CASTLE>four months after Joe and Vera were killed.

498
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,250
<16-9,RYAN>不过呢...
<16-9,RYAN>Still...

499
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,900
<16-10,CASTLE>我们还是该去把1947年的那份案宗调出来
<16-10,CASTLE>we should dig up that 1947 police report.

500
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,730
<16-10,CASTLE>里面或许有关于枪的一些记录
<16-10,CASTLE>There could be something in there about the gun

501
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,150
<16-10,CASTLE>能帮我们侦破斯坦的凶案
<16-10,CASTLE>that could shed some light on Stan's murder.

502
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,400
<16-11,RYAN>好吧  我去仓库
<16-11,RYAN>All right. I'll go to the warehouse

503
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,500
<16-11,RYAN>把以前的案宗调出来
<16-11,RYAN>and I'll pull up the old case files.

504
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,850
<16-12,CASTLE>我也想去
<16-12,CASTLE>Oh, oh, uh, I want to go.

505
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,630
<16-13,RYAN>好吧
<16-13,RYAN>Uh, okay.

506
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,260
<16-14,CASTLE>-我开车行吗  -随你便
<16-14,CASTLE>- Can I drive? - I don't care.

507
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,830
<16-15,RYAN>是这样...
<16-15,RYAN>So...

508
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,700
<16-16,ESPOSITO>我刚刚查了曾属于丹普西的枪支
<16-16,ESPOSITO>I did a search of guns Dempsey used to own.

509
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,200
<16-16,ESPOSITO>结果发现曾举办过一次资产出售
<16-16,ESPOSITO>Turns out there was an estate sale

510
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,900
<16-16,ESPOSITO>一个名叫克莱德·贝拉斯科的寻宝猎人
<16-16,ESPOSITO>where a treasure hunter named Clyde Belasco

511
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,860
<16-16,ESPOSITO>买下了丹普西所有的枪  包括两把38口径
<16-16,ESPOSITO>bought all of Dempsey's firearms, including 2 .38s.

512
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,500
<16-16,ESPOSITO>等等  克莱德·贝拉斯科吗
<16-16,ESPOSITO>Wait. Clyde Belasco?

513
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,520
<16-17,BECKETT>斯坦的妻子说
<16-17,BECKETT>Stan's wife said that

514
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,790
<16-17,BECKETT>他们俩看了一部关于他的纪录片
<16-17,BECKETT>the two of them watched a documentary about him,

515
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,290
<16-17,BECKETT>而斯坦因此受到鼓舞变成了一个寻宝猎人
<16-17,BECKETT>and that inspired Stan to become a treasure hunter.

516
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,790
<16-18,ESPOSITO>联系还不止于此
<16-18,ESPOSITO>Well, the connections don't stop there.

517
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,670
<16-18,ESPOSITO>贝拉斯科一周前从法国飞入境
<16-18,ESPOSITO>Belasco flew in from France a week ago,

518
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,270
<16-18,ESPOSITO>我刚刚找到一篇文章说
<16-18,ESPOSITO>and I just found an article that said

519
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,990
<16-18,ESPOSITO>他找蓝蝴蝶已经有十五年了
<16-18,ESPOSITO>that he searched for the Blue Butterfly for 15 years.

520
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,340
<16-19,BECKETT>那个收注人说斯坦找到一个
<16-19,BECKETT>That bookie said that Stan found someone

521
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,640
<16-19,BECKETT>有缺失的那部分线索的人
<16-19,BECKETT>who had the missing piece of the puzzle.

522
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,010
<16-20,ESPOSITO>或许贝拉斯科就是那个人
<16-20,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe Belasco's that someone.

524
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,890
<17-1,CASTLE>在这儿呢
<17-1,CASTLE>Here it is.

525
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,100
<17-1,CASTLE>最近有人擦过上面的灰尘
<17-1,CASTLE>This has been dusted off recently.

526
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,570
<17-2,RYAN>看来我们不是唯一对本案感兴趣的人
<17-2,RYAN>Looks like we're not the only ones interested in this case.

527
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,340
<17-3,CASTLE>斯坦来过这儿  肯定是他
<17-3,CASTLE>Stan was here. Had to be.

528
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,670
<17-3,CASTLE>你想啊  日记  凶案
<17-3,CASTLE>Think about it--the diary, the murders...

529
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,610
<17-3,CASTLE>我们只是在跟着他的脚印前行
<17-3,CASTLE>All we're doing is walking in his footsteps.

530
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,440
<17-3,CASTLE>这就是下一条线索
<17-3,CASTLE>This is the next piece of the puzzle.

531
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,650
<17-4,RYAN>薇拉和私家侦探遇害现场的照片
<17-4,RYAN>Huh. Crime scene photo of Vera and the P.I.

532
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,890
<17-5,CASTLE>该死的  乔
<17-5,CASTLE>Damn it, Joe.

533
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,120
<17-5,CASTLE>老伙计
<17-5,CASTLE>You old sap.

534
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,430
<17-5,CASTLE>爱上一个女孩  害得自己身陷火海
<17-5,CASTLE>Dizzy with a dame and got yourself cooked.

536
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,140
<17-6,RYAN>鲍嘉先生  我们到底要找什么呢
<17-6,RYAN>So, Mr. Bogart, what exactly are we looking for here?

537
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,670
<17-7,CASTLE>1947年的那起凶案和现在的这起
<17-7,CASTLE>Our 1947 murders and our present-day murder

538
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,330
<17-7,CASTLE>之间的联系肯定不仅仅是那支枪
<17-7,CASTLE>have to be connected by more than just a gun.

539
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,690
<17-7,CASTLE>这里面就能找到别的联系
<17-7,CASTLE>Somewhere in here is that connection.

540
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,680
<18-1,CLYDE BELASCO>是啊  我的确买了几支汤姆·丹普西的左轮
<18-1,CLYDE BELASCO>Yes, I bought several of Tom Dempsey's revolvers.

541
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,430
<18-1,CLYDE BELASCO>你们如果愿意  大可去检查每一把
<18-1,CLYDE BELASCO>And by all means, test fire every last one of them as you wish.

542
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,460
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我们会的  好了  说说你跟斯坦怎么认识的
<18-2,ESPOSITO>We will. Now... how do you know Stan?

543
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,580
<18-3,CLYDE>你必须了解我是上过电视的人
<18-3,CLYDE>You have to understand that I'm on television.

544
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,950
<18-3,CLYDE>也有写我的文章
<18-3,CLYDE>Articles are written about me.

545
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,340
<18-3,CLYDE>因此  有些业余人士会登门找我
<18-3,CLYDE>Because of this, the amateurs come a-knocking.

546
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,780
<18-3,CLYDE>这是我的职业危害
<18-3,CLYDE>It's an occupational hazard.

547
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,290
<18-4,BECKETT>那么斯坦来找你是为了什么呢
<18-4,BECKETT>And what was the purpose of Stan's visit?

548
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,540
<18-5,CLYDE>当然是冲着蓝蝴蝶来的
<18-5,CLYDE>Why, the Blue Butterfly, of course.

549
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,880
<18-5,CLYDE>他肯定是读到了我费尽心思在找它
<18-5,CLYDE>He must have read of my exploits searching for it

550
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,250
<18-5,CLYDE>就跑来用他荒谬的故事烦我
<18-5,CLYDE>and decided to burden me with his preposterous story.

551
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,530
<18-6,ESPOSITO>什么故事
<18-6,ESPOSITO>And what story was that?

552
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,330
<18-7,CLYDE>他说他找到了一本旧私家侦探的日记
<18-7,CLYDE>That he had found an old private investigator's diary,

553
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,780
<18-7,CLYDE>里面有缺失的线索
<18-7,CLYDE>which held missing clues.

554
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,150
<18-8,ESPOSITO>你不相信吗
<18-8,ESPOSITO>You didn't believe him?

555
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,100
<18-9,CLYDE>当然不
<18-9,CLYDE>Of course not.

556
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,520
<18-9,CLYDE>我要求看这本传说中的日记时  他拒绝了
<18-9,CLYDE>When I asked to see the alleged diary, he refused.

557
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,370
<18-9,CLYDE>却要求看我对佩尼贝克俱乐部的所有研究
<18-9,CLYDE>And yet, he wanted access to all my research on the Pennybaker club.

558
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,220
<18-9,CLYDE>说真的  整件事都很荒谬
<18-9,CLYDE>I mean, really, the whole thing was absurd.

559
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,000
<18-9,CLYDE>他甚至要求从后面走
<18-9,CLYDE>He even asked to exit out the back door.

560
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,780
<18-9,CLYDE>说有辆车在跟踪他
<18-9,CLYDE>Said a car was following him.

561
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,300
<18-9,CLYDE>是一辆白色的野马
<18-9,CLYDE>It was a white mustang.

562
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,750
<18-10,CLYDE>大概还有别人也对蓝蝴蝶有兴趣
<18-10,CLYDE>I guess someone else was interested in the Blue Butterfly, too.

563
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,110
<19-1,RYAN>感觉像是海底捞针
<19-1,RYAN>It feels like we're looking for a needle in a haystack,

564
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,990
<19-1,RYAN>不过我们连海都没找到呢
<19-1,RYAN>except for, we can't find the haystack.

565
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,890
<19-2,CASTLE>要是找到了针还要海何用
<19-2,CASTLE>Who needs a haystack when the needle is right here?

566
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,170
<19-2,CASTLE>这是一份乔的秘书肯纳德太太的口供
<19-2,CASTLE>This is a statement from Joe's secretary Mrs. Kennard.

<25-8,BECKETT>There's no way we can crack Dempsey's secret safe.

574
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,670
<25-9,JERRY>那我们要怎么拿到
<25-9,JERRY>Well, then how are we gonna get it?

<22-3,BECKETT>慢慢转过身来
<22-3,BECKETT>Turn around slowly.

645
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,680
<22-4,BECKETT>你是汤姆·丹普西
<22-4,BECKETT>You're Tom Dempsey.

646
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,360
<22-5,TOM DEMPSEY>没错  是我
<22-5,TOM DEMPSEY>Yeah, that's me.

647
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,150
<22-4,BECKETT>汤姆·丹普西三世
<22-4,BECKETT>Tom Dempsey III.

648
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,470
<23-2,CASTLE>太像了
<23-2,CASTLE>Dead ringer.

649
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,520
<23-2,CASTLE>简直是一个模子刻的
<23-2,CASTLE>Complete doppelganger.

650
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,110
<23-3,TOM>遗传基因的作用  又不是魔术
<23-3,TOM>It's D.N.A., guys. It's not a magic trick.

651
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,610
<23-3,TOM>我是他孙子
<23-3,TOM>I'm his grandson.

652
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,770
<23-3,TOM>好吧
<23-3,TOM>All right, look.

653
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,620
<23-3,TOM>破门而入我很抱歉
<23-3,TOM>I'm sorry I broke in a door.

654
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,800
<23-3,TOM>我会赔偿损失  没什么大不了
<23-3,TOM>I'll pay for the damages. It's no big deal.

655
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,810
<23-3,TOM>为什么还不放我走
<23-3,TOM>Why am I still here?

656
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,430
<23-4,CASTLE>我们只是好奇  想看看
<23-4,CASTLE>Well, we were just curious to see

657
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,540
<23-4,CASTLE>除了长相  你是否还从你祖父那里
<23-4,CASTLE>if you inherited anything else from your grandfather,

658
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,590
<23-4,CASTLE>继承了别的什么
<23-4,CASTLE>aside from his looks.

659
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,980
<23-5,BECKETT>是啊  比如你用来杀害斯坦·班克斯的
<23-5,BECKETT>Yeah, like one of his .38 revolvers that you used

660
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,530
<23-5,BECKETT>点38左轮手枪
<23-5,BECKETT>to kill Stan Banks.

661
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,520
<23-6,TOM>等等  不是这样的
<23-6,TOM>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That didn't happen.

662
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,270
<23-6,TOM>是斯坦来找我
<23-6,TOM>Look, Stan came to me,

663
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,040
<23-6,TOM>可他告诉我  他名叫纳撒尼尔·詹金斯
<23-6,TOM>only he told me his name was Nathaniel Jenkins.

664
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,660
<23-6,TOM>他说他是个传记作家
<23-6,TOM>He said he was a biographer,

665
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,010
<23-6,TOM>说他想写一个关于我祖父的故事
<23-6,TOM>said he wanted to do a story about my grandfather.

666
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,330
<23-6,TOM>他保证说不会写他的违法交易
<23-6,TOM>He promised not to focus on his underworld dealings,

667
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,270
<23-6,TOM>只侧重好的一面
<23-6,TOM>just on the--the good stuff,

668
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,520
<23-6,TOM>比如说我祖父是社区的支柱
<23-6,TOM>like how my granddad was a pillar of the community.

669
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,200
<23-7,CASTLE>社区祸害还差不多
<23-7,CASTLE>More like a killer of the community.

670
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,630
<23-8,BECKETT>当他这么提议
<23-8,BECKETT>And so when he made his pitch,

671
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,040
<23-8,BECKETT>你因为想重塑家族名望  就答应配合了
<23-8,BECKETT>you, wanting to rehabilitate your family name, cooperated.

672
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,920
<23-8,BECKETT>是的
<23-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

673
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,240
<23-9,TOM>我给他看了祖父留下的所有旧文件
<23-9,TOM>I gave him access to all of granddad's old papers,

674
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,960
<23-9,TOM>一切进展顺利
<23-9,TOM>and everything was cool...

675
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,610
<23-9,TOM>直到我发现这整件事都是个谎言
<23-9,TOM>until I found out the whole thing was a lie.

676
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,040
<23-10,BECKETT>你怎么发现的
<23-10,BECKETT>And how'd you do that?

677
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
<23-11,TOM>过去在我祖父的俱乐部里
<23-11,TOM>There's this singer who used to

678
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,460
<23-11,TOM>有个红极一时的歌手
<23-11,TOM>headline at my granddad's club--

679
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,870
<23-11,TOM>叫贝西·辛克莱
<23-11,TOM>Betsy Sinclair.

680
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,930
<23-11,TOM>几周前  她过世了
<23-11,TOM>Couple weeks ago, she passed away.

681
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,710
<23-11,TOM>我前去悼念
<23-11,TOM>Well, I went there to pay my respects,

682
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,150
<23-11,TOM>在那里看见了纳撒尼尔
<23-11,TOM>and who do I see there but Nathaniel,

683
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,590
<23-11,TOM>正跟个老头聊天
<23-11,TOM>chatting up this old guy.

684
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,510
<23-11,TOM>他看见了我  立马从后面跑了
<23-11,TOM>He sees me, jets out the back.

685
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,560
<23-11,TOM>我完全不明白这是怎么回事
<23-11,TOM>I'm like, "What the hell is this all about," right?

686
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,160
<23-11,TOM>所以我查看了来宾名单
<23-11,TOM>So I look in the guest book.

687
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,150
<23-11,TOM>才发现
<23-11,TOM>I figured it out.

688
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,440
<23-11,TOM>他所签的真名是  斯坦·班克斯
<23-11,TOM>He'd signed his real name-- Stan Banks.

689
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,090
<23-12,BECKETT>你就知道他不是传记作家
<23-12,BECKETT>Which is when you figured out he wasn't really a biographer.

690
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,020
<23-13,TOM>他只是又一个卑鄙的寻宝猎人
<23-13,TOM>He was just another lowlife treasure hunter,

691
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,690
<23-13,TOM>在找蓝蝴蝶的下落
<23-13,TOM>looking for the blue butterfly.

692
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,470
<23-14,CASTLE>再说  如果有谁该得到蓝蝴蝶
<23-14,CASTLE>And if anybody deserved the blue butterfly,

693
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,890
<23-14,CASTLE>那人理应是你  对吗
<23-14,CASTLE>it was you, right?

694
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,530
<23-15,CASTLE>所以你跟踪了斯坦
<23-15,CASTLE>So you followed Stan.

695
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,570
<23-15,CASTLE>斯坦找到了它的下落  你就枪杀了他
<23-15,CASTLE>And when stan found it, you shot him.

696
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,770
<23-16,TOM>不  我没有  我没有对他开枪
<23-16,TOM>No, I did not-- I did not shoot him.

697
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,430
<23-16,TOM>斯坦  等等  斯坦找到了
<23-16,TOM>Stan--wait. Stan did find it?

698
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,950
<23-17,BECKETT>得了  别装了
<23-17,BECKETT>Come on. You tell us.

699
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,930
<23-18,TOM>我真不知道  我不在场
<23-18,TOM>I don't know. I was not there.

700
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,160
<23-18,TOM>我看报  发现他死了
<23-18,TOM>I read in the newspaper that the guy was dead.

701
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,280
<23-18,TOM>我就去他的公寓  看看能有什么发现
<23-18,TOM>I went to his apartment to see what I could find.

702
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,160
<23-18,TOM>我没有杀他
<23-18,TOM>And I didn't kill the guy.

703
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,140
<24-1,BECKETT>丹普西的不在场证明成立
<24-1,BECKETT>So Dempsey's alibi holds up.

704
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,710
<24-1,BECKETT>他没有杀斯坦
<24-1,BECKETT>He didn't kill Stan.

705
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,430
<24-2,ESPOSITO>没关系  我们有突破口了
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Well, that's all right, because we caught a break.

706
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,130
<24-2,ESPOSITO>警员终于追踪到了西区瓦利的下落
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Unis finally tracked down West Side Wally.

707
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,880
<24-2,ESPOSITO>正带他过来问话
<24-2,ESPOSITO>They're bringing him in now.

708
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,270
<24-3,BECKETT>很好  也许这能对弄清斯坦的遭遇
<24-3,BECKETT>Great. Maybe that can shed some light

709
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,600
<24-3,BECKETT>有所帮助
<24-3,BECKETT>as to what happened to Stan.

710
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,570
<24-4,CASTLE>如果他不能  也许杰瑞·马多克斯可以
<24-4,CASTLE>And if he can't, maybe Jerry Maddox can.

711
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,950
<24-5,BECKETT>杰瑞·马多克斯
<24-5,BECKETT>Jerry Maddox?

712
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,150
<24-6,CASTLE>你还记得汤姆三世告诉我们
<24-6,CASTLE>You remember how Tom III told us that Stan

713
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,740
<24-6,CASTLE>斯坦去过贝西·辛克莱的葬礼吗
<24-6,CASTLE>went to Betsy Sinclair's funeral?

714
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,760
<24-6,CASTLE>我在想  他为什么去那儿
<24-6,CASTLE>I started thinking, why would he go?

715
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,520
<24-7,ESPOSITO>去调查啊
<24-7,ESPOSITO>To do research.

716
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,730
<24-8,CASTLE>没错  可是调查谁呢
<24-8,CASTLE>Right, but research on whom?

717
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,630
<24-8,CASTLE>于是我去了葬礼会客厅
<24-8,CASTLE>So I stopped by the funeral parlor.

718
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,110
<24-8,CASTLE>结果发现斯坦与死者的友人杰瑞·马多克斯
<24-8,CASTLE>Turns out that Stan spent an awful lot of time

719
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,890
<24-8,CASTLE>聊了好一段时间
<24-8,CASTLE>with a friend of the deceased named Jerry Maddox.

720
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,000
<24-8,CASTLE>而关键是
<24-8,CASTLE>And get this--

721
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,360
<24-8,CASTLE>杰瑞曾是佩尼贝克俱乐部的老酒保
<24-8,CASTLE>Jerry was the old bartender at the Pennybaker Club,

722
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,380
<24-8,CASTLE>他大概是蓝蝴蝶最后一条有迹可循的线索
<24-8,CASTLE>And probably the last living link to the Blue Butterfly.

723
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,230
<24-9,ESPOSITO>做的好  卡塞尔
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Good job, Castle.

724
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,360
<35-1,VIOLA>是吗
<35-1,VIOLA>Yeah?

725
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,710
<35-2,TOM>是啊
<35-2,TOM>Yeah.

726
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,570
<35-2,TOM>杰瑞
<35-2,TOM>Jerry.

727
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,700
<35-2,TOM>这是贝克特警探和卡塞尔先生
<35-2,TOM>This is Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle.

728
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,290
<25-1,FRANKIE>他们想聊聊
<25-1,FRANKIE>They wanted a word.

729
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,430
<25-2,JERRY MADDOX>当然可以
<25-2,JERRY MADDOX>Oh, yeah.

730
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,820
<25-3,VIOLA MADDOX>你们想来点汤吗  自家炖的
<25-3,VIOLA MADDOX>You want some soup? It's homemade.

731
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,090
<25-4,CASTLE>我倒乐意来一碗  闻起来很香
<25-4,CASTLE>Oh, I don't mind if I do. That smells delicious.

732
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,170
<25-5,BECKETT>不用  谢了  不必麻烦了
<25-5,BECKETT>Uh, no, thank you. Actually, we're--we're all right.

733
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,250
<25-6,CASTLE>这首歌是不是
<25-6,CASTLE>Am I hearing

734
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,960
<25-6,CASTLE>《我能给予你的只有爱》
<25-6,CASTLE>"I Can't Give You Anything But Love"?

735
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,640
<25-7,JERRY>没错  孩子
<25-7,JERRY>That's right, kid.

736
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,190
<25-7,JERRY>那也是这首歌最好的版本
<25-7,JERRY>That's the best version of that tune, too.

737
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,960
<25-7,JERRY>你们不是来聊音乐的吧
<25-7,JERRY>You come here to talk music, did you?

738
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,510
<25-8,BECKETT>其实  我们是来调查斯坦·班克斯的谋杀案的
<25-8,BECKETT>Actually, we're here to investigate Stan Bank's murder,

739
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,200
<25-8,BECKETT>我们想知道你是否在贝西·辛克莱的葬礼上
<25-8,BECKETT>And we were wondering if you met him

740
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,410
<25-8,BECKETT>遇到过他
<25-8,BECKETT>at Betsy Sinclair's funeral.

741
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,250
<25-9,JERRY>是的  他  他被杀了吗
<25-9,JERRY>Yeah. He--he was murdered?

742
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,170
<25-11,JERRY>可怜的孩子
<25-11,JERRY>Poor kid.

743
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,670
<25-12,BECKETT>他有没有提到一条叫做蓝蝴蝶的项链
<25-12,BECKETT>Did he mention a necklace called the Blue Butterfly?

744
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,900
<25-13,JERRY>当然  他问了我很多问题
<25-13,JERRY>Oh, sure. Asked me all kinds of questions.

745
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,280
<25-13,JERRY>它可能在哪儿  之类的问题
<25-13,JERRY>Uh, where it might be, stuff like that,

746
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,150
<25-13,JERRY>可我那时只是个酒保
<25-13,JERRY>but I was just a bartender back then.

747
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,100
<25-13,JERRY>我帮不上他
<25-13,JERRY>I-I wasn't much help.

748
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,040
<25-15,CASTLE>下面这个问题  可能听上去很奇怪
<25-15,CASTLE>Now this might seem an odd question,

749
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,330
<25-15,CASTLE>但在1947年  薇拉·莫奎恩和乔·弗林
<25-15,CASTLE>But in 1947, do you remember when Vera Mulqueen

750
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,840
<25-15,CASTLE>被杀的事  你是否还记得
<25-15,CASTLE>and Joe Flynn were murdered?

751
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,390
<25-16,JERRY>当然  那在当时引起很大轰动
<25-16,JERRY>Of course. It was a big deal back then.

752
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,490
<25-16,JERRY>那家俱乐部的所有者  丹普西
<25-16,JERRY>Dempsey, the fella that owned the club,

753
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,510
<25-16,JERRY>残忍地枪杀了他们
<25-16,JERRY>shot them in cold blood.

754
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,130
<25-17,CASTLE>同一年  您还记不记得
<25-17,CASTLE>The same year, do you remember

755
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,390
<25-17,CASTLE>有个名叫莎莉·斯科菲尔德的女人
<25-17,CASTLE>a woman named sally scofield?

756
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,980
<25-17,CASTLE>她一头红发
<25-17,CASTLE>She was a redhead.

757
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,450
<25-17,CASTLE>1947年  她大概是18岁
<25-17,CASTLE>In 1947, she would've been about 18.

758
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,030
<25-18,JERRY>我想我知道你在说谁了
<25-18,JERRY>Oh, I think I know who you're talking about.

759
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,170
<25-18,JERRY>那是在46年
<25-18,JERRY>Now that's back in '46.

760
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,250
<25-18,JERRY>我刚被佩尼贝克雇用
<25-18,JERRY>I had just got hired at the Pennybaker.

761
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,850
<25-18,JERRY>卖香烟啦  雪茄
<25-18,JERRY>Cigarettes. Cigars.

762
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,920
<26-1,JERRY>那时丹普西还没跟薇拉在一起
<26-1,JERRY>Dempsey wasn't dating vera back then.

763
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,100
<26-1,JERRY>他那时的女伴名叫普丽西拉·卡贝尔
<26-1,JERRY>He was going with a gal named Priscilla Campbell.

764
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,550
<26-1,JERRY>普丽西拉有个女儿
<26-1,JERRY>Priscilla had a daughter,

765
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,430
<26-1,JERRY>名叫莎莉的红发女孩
<26-1,JERRY>a redhead named Sally.

766
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,580
<26-1,JERRY>听起来她就是你说的那个
<26-1,JERRY>Sounds like she's the one you mean.

767
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,560
<26-1,JERRY>后来发生的事  就是个悲剧
<26-1,JERRY>Sad story, what happened.

768
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,520
<26-1,JERRY>不久后  薇拉吸引了丹普西的视线
<26-1,JERRY>Not long after vera caught dempsey's eye,

769
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,390
<26-1,JERRY>他抛弃了普丽西拉
<26-1,JERRY>he dropped Priscilla

770
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,510
<26-1,JERRY>无情地断绝了与她和莎莉的往来
<26-1,JERRY>and cut her and Sally off cold.

771
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,460
<26-1,JERRY>他们说这就是蓝蝴蝶的诅咒
<26-1,JERRY>They said it was the curse of the Blue Butterfly.

772
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,050
<26-1,JERRY>普丽西拉服药自杀了
<26-1,JERRY>Priscilla killed herself with a handful of pills.

773
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,600
<26-1,JERRY>莎莉呢
<26-1,JERRY>And Sally?

774
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,030
<27-1,CASTLE>几个月之后
<27-1,CASTLE>Couple months after, uh,

775
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,200
<27-2,JERRY>薇拉和那个私人侦探被杀
<27-2,JERRY>Vera and that P.I. got whacked,

776
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,460
<27-2,JERRY>丹普西死于心脏病
<27-2,JERRY>Dempsey died of a heart attack.

777
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,440
<27-2,JERRY>他葬礼的那晚
<27-2,JERRY>The evening of his funeral,

778
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,350
<27-2,JERRY>莎莉盛装来到俱乐部
<27-2,JERRY>in walks Sally, all dressed up.

779
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,060
<27-2,JERRY>点了一杯纯威士忌
<27-2,JERRY>Ordered a whiskey neat,

780
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,930
<27-2,JERRY>一干而尽
<27-2,JERRY>slammed it back,

781
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,900
<27-2,JERRY>对我露齿冷笑
<27-2,JERRY>gave me a big ol' crocodile grin,

782
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,820
<27-2,JERRY>说她自由了
<27-2,JERRY>Said she was free.

783
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,110
<27-2,JERRY>然后昂首阔步地出了门
<27-2,JERRY>Then she strutted on out the door,

784
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,410
<27-2,JERRY>那是我最后一次见到她
<27-2,JERRY>and that's the last time I ever saw her.

785
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
<27-3,CASTLE>这是个复仇的故事
<27-3,CASTLE>It's a revenge story.

786
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,230
<27-3,CASTLE>莎莉将其母亲之死归罪于薇拉
<27-3,CASTLE>Sally blamed Vera for the death of her mother,

787
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,080
<27-3,CASTLE>密谋杀害她
<27-3,CASTLE>so she plotted to take her down.

788
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,940
<27-3,CASTLE>她利用私家侦探
<27-3,CASTLE>Somehow she used the P.I. to do it.

789
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,230
<27-3,CASTLE>他俩肯定是被她陷害的
<27-3,CASTLE>She must have been setting them up.

790
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,070
<27-4,BECKETT>是的  但这对找出杀害斯坦的凶手
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but how does any of this help us figure out

791
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,370
<27-4,BECKETT>有什么帮助吗
<27-4,BECKETT>who shot Stan?

792
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,380
<27-4,BECKETT>那么
<27-4,BECKETT>So...

793
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,870
<28-1,RYAN>西区瓦利
<28-1,RYAN>West Side Wally.

794
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,080
<28-1,RYAN>能叫你瓦利吗
<28-1,RYAN>May I call you Wally?

795
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,520
<28-2,WALLY>我比较喜欢别人叫我西区
<28-2,WALLY>I prefer West Side.

796
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,440
<28-2,WALLY>好吧
<28-2,WALLY>Of course.

797
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,980
<28-3,RYAN>西区  我们知道两天前你在佩尼贝克俱乐部
<28-3,RYAN>West Side, we know you were at the Pennybaker Club two days ago.

798
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,800
<28-4,ESPOSITO>我们发现了你的"窝"
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we found your squat.

799
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,220
<28-5,WALLY>卡妮  蕾希  你们可以就此打住了
<28-5,WALLY>Cagney and Lacey, you can stop right there.

801
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,130
<28-5,WALLY>两天前我没住在俱乐部
<28-5,WALLY>I wasn't living in the club two days ago.

802
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,850
<28-5,WALLY>有人给我钱请我出去住
<28-5,WALLY>I had already gotten bought out by the other guy.

803
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,360
<28-7,ESPOSITO>-给你钱  -什么人
<28-7,ESPOSITO>- Bought out? - By the other guy?

804
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,580
<28-8,WALLY>几天前  有个人进来
<28-8,WALLY>A few days ago, the other guy comes in,

805
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,090
<28-8,WALLY>开始在酒吧搭窝
<28-8,WALLY>starts setting up a squat by the bar,

806
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,630
<28-8,WALLY>但西区瓦利不喜欢与人同住
<28-8,WALLY>but West Side Wally doesn't do neighbors.

807
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,900
<28-8,WALLY>于是我说"教授  滚远点"
<28-8,WALLY>So I said, "Hey, Professor, kick rocks."

808
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,420
<28-8,WALLY>可他就是不走
<28-8,WALLY>He wouldn't take no for an answer.

809
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,820
<28-8,WALLY>反而给了四百刀让我另觅住所
<28-8,WALLY>Ended up paying me $400 to relocate.

810
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,720
<28-8,WALLY>重申一次  那天我不在
<28-8,WALLY>So again, for the record this time, I wasn't there.

811
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,190
<28-9,RYAN>冷静点  好吗  你知道那人叫什么吗
<28-9,RYAN>Easy, easy, okay. Did you get this guy's name?

812
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,720
<28-10,WALLY>我没问  他也没说
<28-10,WALLY>I didn't ask. He didn't say.

813
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,550
<28-11,ESPOSITO>能描述下他的样子吗
<28-11,ESPOSITO>Can you describe him?

814
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,720
<28-12,WALLY>中等身高  不胖不瘦  白人  50岁左右
<28-12,WALLY>Medium height, medium build, white, 50s.

815
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,390
<28-12,WALLY>我叫他教授
<28-12,WALLY>I called him the Professor

816
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,920
<28-12,WALLY>他讲话就像个矫饰做作的蠢蛋
<28-12,WALLY>because he spoke like a pretentious jerk.

817
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,240
<28-13,WALLY>对  这不是教授嘛
<28-13,WALLY>Hey, it's the Professor.

818
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,840
<28-14,ESPOSITO>克莱德·贝拉斯科
<28-14,ESPOSITO>Clyde Belasco.

819
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,280
<28-14,ESPOSITO>我们知道你去过佩尼贝克俱乐部
<28-14,ESPOSITO>We know that you were at the Pennybaker Club,

820
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,120
<29-1,BECKETT>贝拉斯科先生
<29-1,BECKETT>Mr. Belasco.

821
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,740
<29-1,BECKETT>你用钱把流浪汉打发走
<29-1,BECKETT>You paid off a homeless man

822
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,440
<29-1,BECKETT>这样你就能独自占着那地方
<29-1,BECKETT>so that you could have the place to yourself.

823
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
<29-2,CLYDE>我在上东区有处豪华公寓
<29-2,CLYDE>I have a condo on the upper east side,

824
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,800
<29-2,CLYDE>在波尔多[法国西南部港市]有座城堡
<29-2,CLYDE>a chateau in Bordeaux,

825
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,760
<29-2,CLYDE>在格斯塔德[瑞士滑雪胜地]有座农舍
<29-2,CLYDE>a chalet in Gstaad, and yet.

826
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,010
<29-2,CLYDE>仅凭某个流浪汉的片面之词
<29-2,CLYDE>On the word of some vagrant,

827
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,430
<29-2,CLYDE>你就断定我用钱打发他
<29-2,CLYDE>you believe that I paid to

828
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,620
<29-2,CLYDE>好让自己在荒废的地方搭窝
<29-2,CLYDE>squat in an abandoned building?

829
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,160
<29-2,CLYDE>我可是大名鼎鼎的克莱德·贝拉斯科
<29-2,CLYDE>Me? Clyde Belasco?

830
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,310
<29-3,CASTLE>我们就是这个意思
<29-3,CASTLE>Pretty much.

831
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,070
<29-4,CLYDE>先生  我倒想看看你怎么证明
<29-4,CLYDE>I'd like to see you prove it, sir.

832
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,770
<29-5,BECKETT>好啊  教授  听你的
<29-5,BECKETT>All right, have it your way, Professor.

833
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,480
<29-5,BECKETT>我们庭审宣判见吧
<29-5,BECKETT>We will see you at the sentencing hearing.

834
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,080
<29-6,BECKETT>你可以在监狱里做你的电视节目
<29-6,BECKETT>You can do your TV show from prison.

835
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,430
<29-7,CLYDE>等等
<29-7,CLYDE>Wait.

836
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,200
<29-7,CLYDE>好吧我说
<29-7,CLYDE>Okay.

837
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,700
<29-8,CLYDE>我承认  我在那
<29-8,CLYDE>I was there. I admit it.

838
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,480
<29-8,CLYDE>斯坦被杀之时我在佩尼贝克俱乐部
<29-8,CLYDE>I was at the Pennybaker Club when Stan was killed.

839
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,960
<29-8,CLYDE>但他不是我杀的
<29-8,CLYDE>But I didn't kill him.

840
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,780
<29-8,CLYDE>如我之前所说  斯坦来找我
<29-8,CLYDE>Like I said before, Stan came to me

841
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,550
<29-8,CLYDE>问我要
<29-8,CLYDE>and asked for my research

842
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,380
<29-8,CLYDE>蓝蝴蝶的研究报告
<29-8,CLYDE>on the Blue Butterfly.

843
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,820
<29-9,BECKETT>你拒绝了吗
<29-9,BECKETT>And you said no?

844
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,470
<29-10,CLYDE>我当然拒绝了
<29-10,CLYDE>Of course I said no.

845
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,730
<29-10,CLYDE>我花了15年的时间去找那条项链
<29-10,CLYDE>I searched for that necklace for 15 years,

846
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,720
<29-10,CLYDE>而现在要我去帮他
<29-10,CLYDE>and now I'm just supposed to help him?

847
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,540
<29-10,CLYDE>这份荣耀只属于我
<29-10,CLYDE>The glory was to be mine.

848
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,620
<29-11,CASTLE>但你知道他找到了线索  对吗
<29-11,CASTLE>But you knew he was on to something, didn't you?

849
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,590
<29-12,CLYDE>对
<29-12,CLYDE>Oh, yes.

850
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,180
<29-12,CLYDE>我看得出他已离成功不远  非常接近
<29-12,CLYDE>I could tell he was close, so very close.

851
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,050
<29-12,CLYDE>斯坦知道我从没听说过的
<29-12,CLYDE>Stan knew things about the club, about the necklace

852
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,840
<29-12,CLYDE>关于俱乐部和项链的事
<29-12,CLYDE>that I had never heard before.

853
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,130
<29-13,BECKETT>所以你在俱乐部那侯着
<29-13,BECKETT>So you staked out the club,

854
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,560
<29-13,BECKETT>斯坦一出现 你就把他杀了
<29-13,BECKETT>and when Stan showed, you shot him.

855
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,780
<29-14,CLYDE>探长  我没杀他
<29-14,CLYDE>I didn't shoot him, Detective.

856
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,500
<29-14,CLYDE>我随身都带着把手枪和一条牛鞭
<29-14,CLYDE>Yes, I had a pistol with me and a bullwhip.

857
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,650
<29-14,CLYDE>它们就是我的标志  众所周知
<29-14,CLYDE>They're my trademarks. Everyone knows that.

858
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,530
<29-14,CLYDE>但我还带了面具和手套
<29-14,CLYDE>But I brought a mask and gloves as well

859
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,220
<29-14,CLYDE>我纯粹只想吓唬吓唬他
<29-14,CLYDE>because I was simply going to threaten him

860
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,580
<29-14,CLYDE>窃取他的成果
<29-14,CLYDE>and take the prize.

861
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,090
<29-15,BECKETT>后来呢
<29-15,BECKETT>So then what happened?

862
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,040
<29-16,CLYDE>我躺在那等着他
<29-16,CLYDE>I was lying in wait.

863
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,040
<29-16,CLYDE>斯坦下楼  当他回来的时候  他
<29-16,CLYDE>Stan went downstairs, and when he returned, he was...

864
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,080
<29-16,CLYDE>手握蓝蝴蝶
<29-16,CLYDE>holding the Blue Butterfly.

865
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,920
<29-16,CLYDE>你们真该看看它有多璀璨
<29-16,CLYDE>Oh, you should've seen how it sparkled.

866
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,790
<29-16,CLYDE>完美无瑕
<29-16,CLYDE>Magnificent.

867
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,140
<29-16,CLYDE>我正打算扑抢的时候
<29-16,CLYDE>I was about to pounce

868
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,570
<29-16,CLYDE>突然有人用布捂住我的嘴
<29-16,CLYDE>when suddenly there was a-a rag put over my mouth.

869
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,500
<29-16,CLYDE>甜甜的味道
<29-16,CLYDE>It had a sweet smell,

870
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:58,000
<29-16,CLYDE>布上好像洒了氯仿
<29-16,CLYDE>like it was doused with chloroform.

871
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,430
<29-17,CASTLE>氯仿
<29-17,CASTLE>Chloroform?

872
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,670
<29-17,CASTLE>-真的吗  -绝对是
<29-17,CASTLE>- Really? - It had to be.

873
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,920
<29-18,CLYDE>然后我眼前一黑  我醒来时
<29-18,CLYDE>Everything went dark, and when I came to,

874
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,490
<29-18,CLYDE>斯坦已经死了
<29-18,CLYDE>Stan was dead.

875
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,670
<29-18,CLYDE>我把他尸体搜了个遍
<29-18,CLYDE>I searched his body,

876
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,910
<29-18,CLYDE>肯定是把我弄晕的人拿走了项链
<29-18,CLYDE>but whoever knocked me out took the Blue Butterfly with them.

877
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,880
<30-1,CASTLE>我真希望是他
<30-1,CASTLE>God, I hope it's him.

878
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,950
<30-2,BECKETT>我也是  但是他不认罪
<30-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but without a confession,

879
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,260
<30-2,BECKETT>我们手上的都是间接证据
<30-2,BECKETT>our case is purely circumstantial.

880
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,870
<30-2,BECKETT>我试试看能否拿到贝拉斯科住处的搜查令
<30-2,BECKETT>I'm gonna see if I can get a warrant for Belasco's place.

881
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,260
<30-3,CASTLE>哪个住处  豪华公寓
<30-3,CASTLE>Which place, the condo,

882
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,900
<30-3,CASTLE>城堡  还是农舍
<30-3,CASTLE>the chateau, or the chalet?

883
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
<30-4,BECKETT>你好  我是凯特·贝克特探长
<30-4,BECKETT>Hi, yeah, this is Detective Kate Beckett,

884
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,600
<30-4,BECKETT>12分局
<30-4,BECKETT>12th Precint.

885
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,650
<30-4,BECKETT>找区检察官
<30-4,BECKETT>I'm calling for the riding A.D.A.

886
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,880
<30-5,BECKETT>好的  我等着
<30-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Okay. I'll hold.

887
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,020
<30-6,CASTLE>真令我失望
<30-6,CASTLE>Well, it's kind of disappointing.

888
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,160
<30-6,CASTLE>我多期盼侦破斯坦的凶杀案
<30-6,CASTLE>I was really hoping that solving Stan's murder

889
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,320
<30-6,CASTLE>能给我点答案
<30-6,CASTLE>would give us some answers

890
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,830
<30-6,CASTLE>让我知道乔和薇拉身上到底发生了什么
<30-6,CASTLE>to what really happened to Joe and Vera.

891
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,630
<30-7,BECKETT>但我们已经知道了
<30-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but what we already know what really happened.

892
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,080
<30-7,BECKETT>丹普西把他们俩杀了
<30-7,BECKETT>Dempsey killed them both.

893
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,560
<30-8,CASTLE>这是显而易见的
<30-8,CASTLE>Well, that's obvious version.

894
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,270
<30-8,CASTLE>但莎莉呢
<30-8,CASTLE>But what about Sally?

895
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,020
<30-8,CASTLE>她在整件事中扮演着什么角色  而且
<30-8,CASTLE>What's her part in all of this? And...

896
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,240
<30-8,CASTLE>为何他会雇佣乔
<30-8,CASTLE>why would she hire Joe?

897
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,290
<30-9,BECKETT>我想我们永远也不可能知道了
<30-9,BECKETT>Well, I guess we'll never know.

898
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,400
<30-10,CASTLE>不  事情还没结束
<30-10,CASTLE>No, something else was going on.

899
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,800
<30-10,CASTLE>我们遗漏了些事
<30-10,CASTLE>Something we're missing.

900
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,650
<30-10,CASTLE>她穿着T字带斜面的鞋  穿着很土的衣服
<30-10,CASTLE>"Wearing t-strap shoes and a country suit,

901
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,090
<30-10,CASTLE>我看得出红发女是个刚进城的乡巴佬
<30-10,CASTLE>I could tell that redhead was a hick off the cob."

902
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,570
<30-11,BECKETT>等等  你刚说什么
<30-11,BECKETT>Wait. What did you just say?

903
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,240
<30-12,CASTLE>这是乔日记里对她的描述
<30-12,CASTLE>Well, that's just how Joe described her in his diary.

904
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,150
<30-13,BECKETT>不  鞋那部分
<30-13,BECKETT>No, the--the part about the shoes?

905
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,410
<30-14,CASTLE>T字带  就是鞋带绕过
<30-14,CASTLE>T-strap. It's when the strap comes over the--

906
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:12,890
<30-15,BECKETT>我能待会再打给你吗
<30-15,BECKETT>Yeah. Can I just call you back?

907
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,620
<30-15,BECKETT>好的
<30-15,BECKETT>Okay.

908
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,290
<30-16,BECKETT>看看这张照片
<30-16,BECKETT>Take a look at this photo.

909
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,000
<30-16,BECKETT>车旁边有只鞋
<30-16,BECKETT>There's a shoe next to the car.

910
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,640
<30-16,BECKETT>仔细看看那鞋的样式
<30-16,BECKETT>And look at what kind of shoe it is.

911
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,120
<30-17,CASTLE>T字带
<30-17,CASTLE>That's a T-strap.

912
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,010
<30-17,CASTLE>你不会想说
<30-17,CASTLE>You don't think...

913
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,520
<30-18,BECKETT>如果薇拉当晚在俱乐部
<30-18,BECKETT>If Vera was at the club that night,

914
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,390
<30-18,BECKETT>她会身着礼服
<30-18,BECKETT>she'd be dressed in an elegant dress and...

915
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,480
<30-19,CASTLE>高跟鞋  死的不是薇拉
<30-19,CASTLE>And heels. This isn't Vera.

916
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,630
<30-19,CASTLE>死的是莎莉
<30-19,CASTLE>This is Sally.

917
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,600
<30-20,BECKETT>也不可能是莎莉
<30-20,BECKETT>Yeah, but it can't be Sally.

918
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,650
<30-20,BECKETT>酒保说案发后几个月他还见过莎莉
<30-20,BECKETT>The bartender said that he saw her months after the murders.

919
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,660
<30-21,CASTLE_BECKETT>-除非他说谎  -他说谎
<30-21,CASTLE_BECKETT>- Unless... he lied. - He lied.

920
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,070
<30-22,BECKETT>但那是半个多世纪前的事了
<30-22,BECKETT>But that was over half a century ago.

921
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,320
<30-22,BECKETT>他为何如此
<30-22,BECKETT>Why would he lie about that?

922
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,480
<30-23,CASTLE>贝克特  我刚刚意识到一件事
<30-23,CASTLE>Beckett, I just realized something.

923
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,280
<30-25,CASTLE>《我能给予你的只有爱》
<30-25,CASTLE>"I Can't Give You Anything But Love."

924
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,230
<30-26,BECKETT>什么意思
<30-26,BECKETT>W-what?

925
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,010
<30-27,CASTLE>我们询问酒保时  播放的那首歌
<30-27,CASTLE>That's what was playing when we interviewed the bartender.

926
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,350
<30-28,BECKETT>对  我想起来了
<30-28,BECKETT>Right. Right.

927
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,620
<30-28,BECKETT>他说那是这首歌最好的版本
<30-28,BECKETT>He said that that was the best version of the song.

928
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,730
<30-29,CASTLE>这是路易斯·阿姆斯特朗[美国爵士歌手]的版本
<30-29,CASTLE>It was Louis Armstrong's version.

929
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,650
<30-29,CASTLE>乔的日记里  他说他最爱的歌手是沙奇摩
<30-29,CASTLE>In Joe's diary, he says his favorite performer is Satchmo.

930
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,180
<30-29,CASTLE>沙奇摩的真名是
<30-29,CASTLE>What's Satchmo's real name?

931
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,180
<30-30,BECKETT>路易斯·阿姆斯特朗
<30-30,BECKETT>Louis Armstrong.

932
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,600
<30-31,CASTLE>全部联系起来
<30-31,CASTLE>Put it all together,

933
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,140
<30-31,CASTLE>答案很明晰了
<30-31,CASTLE>the answer is clear.

934
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,810
<31-1,VIOLA>又见面了
<31-1,VIOLA>Oh. Hello again.

935
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,130
<31-2,BECKETT>薇拉你好
<31-2,BECKETT>Hello, Vera.

<31-3,CASTLE>And hello, Joe.

937
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,580
<32-1,CASTLE>薇拉·莫奎恩和乔·弗林
<32-1,CASTLE>Well, if it isn't Vera Mulqueen and Joe Flynn,

938
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,100
<32-1,CASTLE>起死回生
<32-1,CASTLE>back from the dead.

939
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,520
<32-2,FRANKIE>一切都好吗
<32-2,FRANKIE>Everything all right, guys?

940
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,340
<32-3,VIOLA>一切都好  多谢关心  弗兰基
<32-3,VIOLA>Everything's peachy. Thanks, Frankie.

941
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,420
<32-4,BECKETT>怎么回事  斯坦发现真相了吗
<32-4,BECKETT>What happened? Stan figured out the truth,

942
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,290
<32-4,BECKETT>发现你俩还活着
<32-4,BECKETT>that you two were alive,

943
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,740
<32-4,BECKETT>发现你们为了偷走蓝蝴蝶
<32-4,BECKETT>that you murdered two people

944
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,890
<32-4,BECKETT>而杀了两个人吗
<32-4,BECKETT>so you could disappear with the Blue Butterfly?

945
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,320
<32-4,BECKETT>于是你们就把他骗到俱乐部然后杀了他吗
<32-4,BECKETT>So you lured him to the club and then you shot him?

946
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:42,070
<32-5,JERRY>小姐  你的推测全错了
<32-5,JERRY>Lady, you got it all wrong.

947
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,370
<32-5,JERRY>斯坦在贝西的葬礼上缠住了我
<32-5,JERRY>Stan cornered me at Betsy's funeral,

948
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,050
<32-5,JERRY>想知道我是怎么认识她的
<32-5,JERRY>wanting to know how I knew her.

949
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,230
<32-5,JERRY>于是我只好骗他说我是当时的酒保
<32-5,JERRY>So I lied and told him I was a bartender.

950
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,730
<32-6,VIOLA>但是斯坦很聪明  他太聪明了
<32-6,VIOLA>But Stan was clever. He was too clever.

951
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,740
<32-6,VIOLA>他把我们识破了
<32-6,VIOLA>He figured us out.

952
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,380
<32-6,VIOLA>他跑来这里逼我们说出
<32-6,VIOLA>He came here demanding to know

953
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,020
<32-6,VIOLA>蓝蝴蝶的下落
<32-6,VIOLA>where the Blue Butterfly was.

954
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,080
<32-6,VIOLA>他威胁说要告发我们
<32-6,VIOLA>He threatened to expose us.

955
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,140
<32-7,JERRY>他不达目的绝不善罢甘休
<32-7,JERRY>He was like a dog after a bone.

956
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
<32-7,JERRY>所以我们就满足了他的要求
<32-7,JERRY>So we told him what he needed to know.

957
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,200
<32-7,JERRY>我们把蓝蝴蝶的下落告诉他了
<32-7,JERRY>We told him where it was.

958
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,380
<32-7,JERRY>但是我们并没有杀他
<32-7,JERRY>But we didn't kill him.

959
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,640
<32-8,CASTLE>得了  伙计们
<32-8,CASTLE>Oh, come on, you guys.

960
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,540
<32-8,CASTLE>肯定是你们俩干的
<32-8,CASTLE>We know it's you.

961
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,510
<32-8,CASTLE>你们用了1947年犯案的同一把枪
<32-8,CASTLE>You used the same gun from the '47 murders to kill Stan.

962
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,040
<32-9,VIOLA>同一把枪  我们一直把那把枪放在
<32-9,VIOLA>Same gun? Oh, we keep that gun in the --

963
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,580
<32-10,JERRY>装瓷器的碗橱里
<32-10,JERRY>The china cabinet drawer.

964
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,030
<32-11,BECKETT>你想都别想
<32-11,BECKETT>Don't even think about it.

965
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,040
<32-12,BECKETT>把枪放下
<32-12,BECKETT>Put the gun down.

966
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,120
<32-13,VIOLA>弗兰西斯·本杰明·亨特沙克
<32-13,VIOLA>Francis Benjamin Huntsacker,

967
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,400
<32-13,VIOLA>你都干了什么呀
<32-13,VIOLA>what have you done?

968
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,800
<32-14,CASTLE>等一下  亨特沙克
<32-14,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Huntsacker?

969
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,200
<32-15,CASTLE>正是你母亲把那本日记卖给了斯坦
<32-15,CASTLE>It was your mother who sold the diary to Stan.

970
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,310
<32-16,JERRY>什么日记
<32-16,JERRY>What diary?

971
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,410
<32-17,CASTLE>你的日记
<32-17,CASTLE>Your diary.

972
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,970
<32-18,BECKETT>这么说你看过那本日记
<32-18,BECKETT>So you read it,

973
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,110
<32-18,BECKETT>而一直以来你也在寻找那条项链的下落
<32-18,BECKETT>and all this time, you were looking for the necklace, too.

974
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,190
<32-19,FRANKIE>不然我为什么干这烂工作
<32-19,FRANKIE>That's why I got this crap job.

975
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,390
<32-19,FRANKIE>六个月以来  我慢慢使你们信任我
<32-19,FRANKIE>And for six months, I slowly built trust,

976
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,710
<32-19,FRANKIE>渐渐地从你们的嘴里套话
<32-19,FRANKIE>gently acquired information.

977
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,620
<32-19,FRANKIE>结果那混蛋就这么闯进来
<32-19,FRANKIE>And then that jerk just waltzes in here

978
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,550
<32-19,FRANKIE>逼你们说出了项链的下落
<32-19,FRANKIE>and bullies the location of the Blue Butterfly from you?

979
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,440
<32-19,FRANKIE>拜托
<32-19,FRANKIE>Come on!

980
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,540
<32-20,JERRY>当你意识到这是最后的机会时
<32-20,JERRY>So when you realized it was now or never,

981
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,540
<32-20,JERRY>你伏击了斯坦
<32-20,JERRY>you bushwhacked Stan,

982
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,210
<32-20,JERRY>然后抢走了蓝蝴蝶
<32-20,JERRY>took the Blue Butterfly for yourself?

983
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,490
<32-21,FRANKIE>我带上枪就是为了以防万一
<32-21,FRANKIE>I brought their old .38 only as a precaution.

984
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,390
<32-21,FRANKIE>我只想把斯坦迷晕然后从他那偷走蓝蝴蝶
<32-21,FRANKIE>I was just gonna chloroform Stan and steal it.

985
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,030
<32-22,BECKETT>但你却发现克莱德·贝拉斯科藏在吧台后面
<32-22,BECKETT>But you found Clyde Belasco hiding behind the bar.

986
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,610
<32-23,FRANKIE>我拔出了枪  斯坦冲了上来
<32-23,FRANKIE>I pulled the gun, Stan grabbed for it...

987
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,810
<32-23,FRANKIE>听着  我不是故意的
<32-23,FRANKIE>Look, I didn't mean to.

988
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,970
<32-24,BECKETT>走吧  弗兰基  你被捕了
<32-24,BECKETT>Let's go, Frankie. You're under arrest.

989
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,450
<33-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你猜我们在弗兰基的公寓里
<33-1,BECKETT>Hey, Castle, guess what we found

990
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,430
<33-1,BECKETT>找到了什么
<33-1,BECKETT>at Frankie's apartment.

991
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,590
<33-2,CASTLE>天啊
<33-2,CASTLE>Oh, my.

992
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,540
<33-2,CASTLE>天啊
<33-2,CASTLE>Oh, my god.

993
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,710
<33-2,CASTLE>太美了
<33-2,CASTLE>It's beautiful.

994
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,270
<33-3,BECKETT>-是个赝品  -你说什么
<33-3,BECKETT>- It's fake.  - What?

995
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,690
<33-4,CASTLE>我们已经把它拿去鉴定过了
<33-4,CASTLE>We confirmed it with an appraiser.

996
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,740
<33-5,BECKETT>这只是手工精良的人造珠宝而已
<33-5,BECKETT>It's well-crafted costume jewelry.

997
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,320
<33-6,CASTLE>这么多人费了这么大劲  就为这吗
<33-6,CASTLE>All this time, and it's paste?

998
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
<33-6,CASTLE>这还真是
<33-6,CASTLE>That's...

999
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,410
<33-6,CASTLE>又或者峰回路转又一村
<33-6,CASTLE>Or maybe it's a twist on a twist.

1000
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,500
<33-6,CASTLE>也许真正的蓝蝴蝶
<33-6,CASTLE>Maybe the real Blue Butterfly

1001
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,120
<33-6,CASTLE>在多年前就被人掉包了
<33-6,CASTLE>was switched out for this one years ago.

1002
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,060
<33-7,BECKETT>不管怎样  摆在我们面前的事实都是一样的
<33-7,BECKETT>Well, whatever happened, it doesn't change the facts.

1003
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,570
<33-7,BECKETT>我们还有案子没结呢
<33-7,BECKETT>We still have one more case to close.

1004
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,750
<34-1,BECKETT>现在我们知道
<34-1,BECKETT>Okay, so now we know

1005
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,280
<34-1,BECKETT>杀害斯坦的凶手是弗兰基
<34-1,BECKETT>that Frankie killed Stan,

1006
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,460
<34-1,BECKETT>但是我们还有两宗谋杀案未破呢
<34-1,BECKETT>but there are still two murders that need to be solved --

1007
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,960
<34-1,BECKETT>也就是莎莉·坎贝尔和被你们丢在汽车里的另一具尸体
<34-1,BECKETT>Sally Campbell and whoever else you put in that car.

1008
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,210
<34-2,CASTLE>你们现在该老实交代1947年6月24日的晚上
<34-2,CASTLE>It's time you come clean on what happened

1009
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,080
<34-2,CASTLE>到底发生了什么
<34-2,CASTLE>the evening of June 24, 1947,

1010
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,920
<34-2,CASTLE>也就是你们失踪的那晚
<34-2,CASTLE>The night you disappeared.

1011
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,110
<34-3,JERRY>告诉他们吧  薇拉
<34-3,JERRY>Tell them, Vera.

1012
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,180
<34-4,VIOLA>我们都挤在收音机前
<34-4,VIOLA>We were all huddled around the, uh, radio, listening to

1013
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,890
<34-4,VIOLA>收听舒格·雷·罗宾逊对战吉米·度耶的职业拳击赛
<34-4,VIOLA>the Sugar Ray Robinson VS Jimmy Doyle prizefight, and, uh,

1014
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,180
<35-1,VIOLA>而我一直在为逃跑的计划而坐立不安
<35-1,VIOLA>I was building up nerve to make my escape.

1015
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,530
<34-3,JERRY>将两人分开
<34-3,JERRY>...breaks up the clinch.

1016
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,100
<34-4,VIOLA>渐渐疲劳的吉米·度耶挥出一记左拳  又是一拳
<34-4,VIOLA>A slowly tiring Jimmy Doyle throws a left, another left.

1017
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,630
<34-4,VIOLA>接下来是罗宾逊
<34-4,VIOLA>Here comes Robinson.

1018
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,300
<34-4,VIOLA>一记左拳  一记右拳  又一记左拳
<34-4,VIOLA>A left. A right. Another left...

1019
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,230
<34-4,VIOLA>莫克西  我要去洗手间
<34-4,VIOLA>Moxie, I need to powder my nose.

1020
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,090
<34-4,VIOLA>你开什么玩笑  非得现在去吗
<34-4,VIOLA>Are you kidding me? Can it wait?

1021
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,020
<34-4,VIOLA>对
<34-4,VIOLA>No.

1022
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,020
<35-1,VIOLA>听你的  老板
<35-1,VIOLA>Ah, what do you say, boss?

1023
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,040
<35-2,TOM>好吧  快去快回
<35-2,TOM>Yeah, yeah, yeah, make it quick.

1024
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,760
<34-4,VIOLA>罗宾逊改变策略
<34-4,VIOLA>Robinson regroups.

1025
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,660
<34-4,VIOLA>罗宾逊挥出一记左拳  右拳  接着又是一记左拳
<34-4,VIOLA>Robinson delivers a left, a right, a left again.

1026
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,250
<34-4,VIOLA>度耶回击  但却被罗宾逊躲了过去
<34-4,VIOLA>Doyle punches back, but missed him by a mile.

1027
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,350
<36-1,LENNY>真是天作之合呀
<36-1,LENNY>Well, aren't you a picture?

1028
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,200
<36-1,LENNY>你是谁
<36-1,LENNY>Who are you?

1029
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,300
<36-2,LENNY>我是她男人
<36-2,LENNY>I'm with her.

1030
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,720
<34-3,JERRY>把手举起来
<34-3,JERRY>Put 'em up.

1031
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,780
<36-3,VIOLA>那家伙是莎莉的丈夫
<36-3,VIOLA>The guy was Sally's husband.

1032
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,250
<36-3,VIOLA>她雇用乔只是为了把我从丹普西身边带走
<36-3,VIOLA>She'd only hired Joe to get me away from Dempsey

1033
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,520
<36-3,VIOLA>她好实施她的复仇计划
<36-3,VIOLA>so she could exact her revenge.

1034
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,770
<36-3,VIOLA>现在该让你尝尝我母亲所受的苦了
<36-3,VIOLA>Now you're gonna suffer, Vera, like my mother suffered.

1035
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,510
<36-4,LENNY>等一下  莎莎  我先去拿项链
<36-4,LENNY>Wait, Sal. Let me get the ice first.

1036
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,190
<36-4,LENNY>不
<36-4,LENNY>No!

1037
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,610
<36-4,LENNY>兰尼
<36-4,LENNY>Lenny!

1038
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,100
<36-4,LENNY>你干吗
<36-4,LENNY>Ugh! What are you doing?

1039
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,420
<36-4,LENNY>把枪给我
<36-4,LENNY>Give me the gun!

1040
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,900
<36-4,LENNY>乔
<36-4,LENNY>Oh! Joe!

1041
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,810
<36-4,LENNY>我们本就深陷泥潭
<36-4,LENNY>We were hot as a pistol

1042
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,030
<37-1,VIOLA>这下我们手上又多了两条人命
<37-1,VIOLA>and -- and we had two bodies on our hands,

1043
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,640
<37-1,VIOLA>我们不得不想点办法
<37-1,VIOLA>And we had to do something.

1044
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,450
<32-1,CASTLE>而乔
<32-1,CASTLE>And Joe...

1045
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,320
<38-1,VIOLA>想出了一个完美计划
<38-1,VIOLA>had the plan.

1046
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,720
<38-2,VIOLA>没人会去寻找那两个人的下落
<38-2,VIOLA>No one would be looking for those two.

1047
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,840
<38-2,VIOLA>而我们正好需要消失
<38-2,VIOLA>We needed to disappear.

1048
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,740
<38-2,VIOLA>显然  我们隐藏的不够好
<38-2,VIOLA>Obviously, we didn't disappear far enough.

1049
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,330
<38-2,VIOLA>那么
<38-2,VIOLA>So...

1050
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,370
<39-1,VIOLA>你要逮捕我们吗
<39-1,VIOLA>are you going to arrest us?

1051
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,230
<39-2,BECKETT>我逮捕你们干吗
<39-2,BECKETT>Why would I do that?

1052
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,010
<39-2,BECKETT>听上去你们是在自卫
<39-2,BECKETT>Sounds like self-defense.

1053
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,850
<39-2,BECKETT>再说
<39-2,BECKETT>Besides...

1054
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,800
<39-2,BECKETT>我们要找的是一个叫做薇拉
<39-2,BECKETT>we're looking for a woman named Vera,

1055
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,890
<39-2,BECKETT>而不是维奥拉
<39-2,BECKETT>not Viola,

1056
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,410
<39-2,BECKETT>要找的是私家侦探乔
<39-2,BECKETT>And a P.I. named Joe,

1057
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,960
<39-2,BECKETT>而不是前酒保杰瑞
<39-2,BECKETT>not a former bartender named Jerry.

1058
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,650
<39-3,JERRY>我们真不知道该怎么感谢你们
<39-3,JERRY>We don't know how to thank you.

1059
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,340
<39-3,JERRY>我知道
<39-3,JERRY>I do.

1060
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,070
<39-4,CASTLE>回答我两个问题
<39-4,CASTLE>Answer two questions.

1061
