9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,950
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>当剧痛穿透身体  她发出惨叫
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>She screamed as the pain ripped through her,

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,750
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>呼吸沉重  她心想
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>and in between each labored breath, she thought,

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,130
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>我绝不能在布朗克斯区的地铁里
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>there is no way in hell I am having this baby

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,420
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>生下这个孩子
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>on a subway train in the Bronx.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,060
<1-2,MARTHA>你都记下来了吗
<1-2,MARTHA>Did you get all that?

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,260
<1-3,MARCUS>你真的是在地铁里生下你儿子的吗
<1-3,MARCUS>So you actually gave birth to your son on the metro?

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,160
<1-3,MARCUS>不
<1-3,MARCUS>No.

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,190
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>不是的
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>She didn't.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,740
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>她也没在生我前一周跑马拉松
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>She also didn't run a marathon the week before she had me

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,080
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>或者是在怀胎九月时暴打了一个劫匪
<1-4,RICHARD CASTLE>or beat up a mugger while nine months pregnant.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,820
<1-5,MARTHA>这叫艺术加工  儿子
<1-5,MARTHA>It's called dramatic license, darling.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,870
<1-6,CASTLE>应该叫夸大其辞
<1-6,CASTLE>Actually, it's called wild exaggeration.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,320
<1-6,CASTLE>艺术加工只适用于写作
<1-6,CASTLE>Dramatic license applies to writing.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,590
<1-6,CASTLE>我就是在写作呢
<1-6,CASTLE>And that's what I'm doing.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,550
<1-7,MARTHA>这是马库斯
<1-7,MARTHA>This is Marcus,

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,050
<1-7,MARTHA>我跟你提过的那个超级棒的年轻剧作家
<1-7,MARTHA>this fabulous young playwright I told you about,

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,230
<1-7,MARTHA>他在帮我编写我的独角戏剧本
<1-7,MARTHA>who's helping me put together my one-woman show.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,860
<1-8,MARCUS>卡塞尔先生  我是你的超级粉丝
<1-8,MARCUS>Mr.Castle, I'm a huge fan.

27
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
<1-8,MARCUS>能来到这里就像美梦成真一样
<1-8,MARCUS>Just being in this office is a dream come true.

28
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,450
<1-9,CASTLE>对我来说也一样  一样
<1-9,CASTLE>For me, too. For me, too.

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,090
<1-9,CASTLE>只是我在我的梦里  通常...
<1-9,CASTLE>Only in my dreams, I'm...

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,300
<1-9,CASTLE>只有我一个人
<1-9,CASTLE>usually by myself.

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,850
<1-10,MARTHA>我们只是感觉这房间有激发创造力的能量
<1-10,MARTHA>We just felt that this room had the best creative juju.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,260
<1-11,CASTLE>是啊  是啊
<1-11,CASTLE>Oh, it does. It does.

33
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,200
<1-11,CASTLE>我在这里写了二十本畅销书
<1-11,CASTLE>Yeah, I wrote 20 best sellers in here.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,680
<1-12,MARTHA>是啊
<1-12,MARTHA>Right.

35
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,640
<1-13,CASTLE>我还想再写一本
<1-13,CASTLE>I'd like to write another one.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,580
<1-13,CASTLE>现在就想
<1-13,CASTLE>Now.

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,390
<1-14,MARTHA>不能等会儿吗  儿子
<1-14,MARTHA>Oh, can't it wait, dear?

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
<1-14,MARTHA>我们刚刚在对第一幕做最终修改
<1-14,MARTHA>We're just putting the final touches on act one--

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,670
<1-14,MARTHA>描述的是  我怎样克服工作和
<1-14,MARTHA>You know, where I overcome the challenges of being

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,020
<1-14,MARTHA>单亲母亲的双重挑战
<1-14,MARTHA>a single, working mother.

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,430
<1-15,CASTLE>你知道你写的内容都是杜撰的吧
<1-15,CASTLE>You know you're writing a work of fiction, right?

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,820
<1-15,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<1-15,CASTLE>Castle.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,640
<2-1,CASTLE>先是阿丽克西斯在蕾妮那里实习  谢谢
<2-1,CASTLE>First Alexis is interning for Lanie. Thank you.

44
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,550
<2-1,CASTLE>现在我妈又占用了我的办公室
<2-1,CASTLE>Now my mother is taking over my office.

45
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,430
<2-1,CASTLE>我感觉我的整个生活受到了侵扰
<2-1,CASTLE>I feel like my whole life is being invaded.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,610
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>你会习惯的  我就是这么过来的
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>You'll get used to it. I did.

47
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,760
<2-3,CASTLE>这是两码事
<2-3,CASTLE>It is not the same thing.

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,230
<2-3,CASTLE>好吧  有些类似  但是没那么烦人嘛
<2-3,CASTLE>Okay, it's similar, just much less invasive.

49
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,370
<2-4,BECKETT>蕾妮
<2-4,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

50
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,650
<2-4,BECKETT>这里是什么情况
<2-4,BECKETT>So what do we got here?

51
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,990
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>问得好
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>That's a good question.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,340
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>我能告诉你的是
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>I can tell you this much--

53
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,100
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>从尸温和凝血情况来看
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>Based on body temp and lividity,

54
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,710
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>死者死于十点到午夜之间
<2-5,LANIE PARISH>our victim died between 10:00 and midnight.

55
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,120
<2-6,CASTLE>爪印
<2-6,CASTLE>Claw marks?

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,660
<2-6,CASTLE>她被野兽袭击了吗
<2-6,CASTLE>She was attacked by an animal?

57
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,160
<2-7,LANIE>她死前在逃跑
<2-7,LANIE>Well, she was running from something.

58
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,670
<2-7,LANIE>脚下沾有泥土
<2-7,LANIE>She's got dirt on her feet.

59
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,020
<2-8,BECKETT>中央公园有什么野兽能把人咬死
<2-8,BECKETT>What animal in central park could maul a person to death?

60
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,310
<2-9,LANIE>还不一定是这样呢
<2-9,LANIE>I'm not even sure that's what happened.

61
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,360
<2-9,LANIE>撕裂伤口看起来很浅而且不致命
<2-9,LANIE>These lacerations look shallow, nonlethal,

62
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,970
<2-9,LANIE>不过我得到把尸体送回停尸间
<2-9,LANIE>but I won't know exactly what killed her

63
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,220
<2-9,LANIE>才能确认死因
<2-9,LANIE>until I get her back to the morgue.

64
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,200
<2-10,BECKETT>知道她身份吗
<2-10,BECKETT>Do you have an I.D.?

65
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,810
<2-11,LANIE>没有钱包或手袋  所以没法辨认身份
<2-11,LANIE>No wallet or purse, so we don't know who she is.

66
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,330
<2-13,CASTLE>还不明显吗  难道只有我发现了吗
<2-13,CASTLE>Isn't it obvious? I mean, am I the only one seeing this?

67
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,240
<2-14,BECKETT>什么
<2-14,BECKETT>What?

68
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,000
<2-15,CASTLE>红斗篷  森林  野兽袭击
<2-15,CASTLE>Red cloak, in the woods, animal attack.

69
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,980
<2-16,CASTLE>她是小红帽
<2-16,CASTLE>She's little red riding hood.

70
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,580
<2-17,BECKETT>好啊  卡塞尔  我会全面通缉大灰狼的
<2-17,BECKETT>Great, Castle. I'll call in an A.P.B. for the big bad wolf.

71
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,160
<2-18,CASTLE>你有更好的想法吗
<2-18,CASTLE>You have a better theory?

72
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,540
<2-19,BECKETT>莱恩
<2-19,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan.

73
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,700
<2-19,BECKETT>你能去问下调度
<2-19,BECKETT>Do you think you could call dispatch,

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,630
<2-19,BECKETT>是否接到公园附近
<2-19,BECKETT>see if there any reports of a violent animal

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,440
<2-19,BECKETT>有猛兽出没的报告
<2-19,BECKETT>running around the park?

76
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,110
<2-20,KEVIN RYAN>比如很大很灰的狼吗
<2-20,KEVIN RYAN>Like a wolf, a big bad one?

77
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,500
<2-21,BECKETT>你也来这套
<2-21,BECKETT>Really?

78
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,460
<2-22,RYAN>这完全就是我心里小红帽的形象
<2-22,RYAN>That is exactly how I pictured her.

79
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,530
<2-22,RYAN>真让人毛骨悚然
<2-22,RYAN>It's freaky.

80
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,480
<2-22,RYAN>小时候我姐姐就读小红帽我听
<2-22,RYAN>My older sister used to read me that story.

81
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,810
<2-23,BECKETT>好了  等你回忆完你的童年之后
<2-23,BECKETT>Okay, when you're done reliving your childhood memories,

82
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,350
<2-23,BECKETT>能在这附近搜寻下
<2-23,BECKETT>do you also think that you could canvass the area

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,630
<2-23,BECKETT>目击证人或者认识她的人吗
<2-23,BECKETT>for witnesses and anyone that might know her name?

84
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,290
<2-23,BECKETT>而且我打赌她肯定不叫小红帽
<2-23,BECKETT>And I bet you it's not gonna be little red riding hood.

85
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,200
<2-24,RYAN>马上去
<2-24,RYAN>On it.

86
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,220
<3-1,CASTLE>"这样才能一口吃掉你呀
<3-1,CASTLE>"'All the better to eat you with.'

87
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,400
<3-1,CASTLE>大灰狼一说完
<3-1,CASTLE>No sooner had the wolf said these words

88
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,880
<3-1,CASTLE>就突然跳起来把可怜的小红帽
<3-1,CASTLE>when he leaped up and gobbled down

89
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,620
<3-1,CASTLE>吞进了肚子"
<3-1,CASTLE>poor little red riding hood."

90
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,330
<3-1,CASTLE>好消息是  这只狼会说话
<3-1,CASTLE>Well, the good news is, the wolf can talk.

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,500
<3-1,CASTLE>只要我们找到他  我们就能让他招供
<3-1,CASTLE>So if we can find him, we might be able to get a confession.

92
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,800
<3-2,BECKETT>是啊  只是在原版故事中
<3-2,BECKETT>Yeah, except in the original story,

93
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,530
<3-2,BECKETT>大灰狼没有杀死小红帽
<3-2,BECKETT>the wolf doesn't kill little red riding hood.

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,730
<3-2,BECKETT>猎人剪开大灰狼的肚子救出了她
<3-2,BECKETT>The huntsman cuts her out of the wolf's stomach,

95
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,090
<3-2,BECKETT>然后她杀了大灰狼
<3-2,BECKETT>and then she kills the wolf.

96
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,720
<3-3,CASTLE>看来有人是格林兄弟的大粉丝
<3-3,CASTLE>Someone's a Brothers Grimm fan.

97
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,360
<3-4,BECKETT>是的  他们从不粉饰太平
<3-4,BECKETT>Oh, yeah. They didn't sugarcoat it.

98
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,630
<3-4,BECKETT>他们知道与其说是童话
<3-4,BECKETT>They understood that fairy tales

99
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,930
<3-4,BECKETT>不如说是恐怖故事
<3-4,BECKETT>are pretty much horror stories.

100
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,390
<3-5,CASTLE>正是如此  所以我们才需要童话
<3-5,CASTLE>Exactly, which is why we all need them

101
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,590
<3-5,CASTLE>助我们对抗未知事物
<3-5,CASTLE>to grapple with the unknown,

102
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,500
<3-5,CASTLE>所以童话才会挖掘我们原始的恐惧
<3-5,CASTLE>which is why they tap into our primal fears,

103
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,510
<3-5,CASTLE>像是独自在树林里或者被怪物吃掉之类的
<3-5,CASTLE>like being alone in the woods or getting eaten by monsters.

104
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,720
<3-6,ESPOSITO>童话不是恐怖故事  是生活箴言
<3-6,ESPOSITO>They're not horror stories. They're life lessons.

105
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,750
<3-6,ESPOSITO>做该做的事  才能快乐幸福地生活下去
<3-6,ESPOSITO>If you do the right thing, you get to live happily ever after.

106
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,990
<3-7,BECKETT>只在童话里才会如此
<3-7,BECKETT>But only in fairy tales.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,800
<3-8,ESPOSITO>说到童话  我们的死者
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Speaking of fairy tales, turns out that our victim

108
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,240
<3-8,ESPOSITO>还真的是小红帽
<3-8,ESPOSITO>really was red riding hood.

109
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,220
<3-9,BECKETT>你跟卡塞尔一样疯癫了吗
<3-9,BECKETT>Are you drinking Castle's kool-aid now?

110
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,960
<3-9,BECKETT>不是  我是说她
<3-9,BECKETT>No, I mean that she was

111
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,810
<3-10,ESPOSITO>穿的确实是小红帽的服装
<3-10,ESPOSITO>actually wear in a red riding hood costume

112
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,870
<3-10,ESPOSITO>商标上就这么写的
<3-10,ESPOSITO>It said so right on the label.

113
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,240
<3-11,BECKETT>那为什么她半夜三更
<3-11,BECKETT>Oh, okay. So then why was she wearing it

114
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,870
<3-11,BECKETT>在森林里穿成这样呢
<3-11,BECKETT>in the middle of the woods at night?

115
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,150
<3-12,CASTLE>正往外婆家去吗

<4-9,DARREN>这是什么  斗篷吗
<4-9,DARREN>What is it, a cape?

<4-11,DARREN>She was wearing that?

<4-13,LESLIE>她的运动裤都普拉达的
<4-13,LESLIE>I mean, even her sweatpants were prada.

145
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,680
<4-14,BECKETT>那可能她是去参加聚会
<4-14,BECKETT>Well, maybe she was going to a party.

146

<4-14,BECKETT>她有提到什么聚会吗
<4-14,BECKETT>Did she mention any parties?

<4-15,LESLIE>I'm telling you, she would never wear a thing like this.

148
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,220
<4-16,BECKETT>莱斯利  你妹妹告诉过你
<4-16,BECKETT>Leslie, did your sister ever tell you

149
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,260
<4-16,BECKETT>她生活或工作上异常的事情吗
<4-16,BECKETT>about anything unusual going on at work or in her personal life?

150
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,270
<4-17,LESLIE>我不知道
<4-17,LESLIE>I don't know.

151
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,870
<4-17,LESLIE>我一周没和她联系过了
<4-17,LESLIE>I hadn't heard from her all week.

152
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,610
<4-18,BECKETT>这是算异常吗
<4-18,BECKETT>And was that out of the ordinary?

153
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,890
<4-19,LESLIE>是的  我们通常每天通话
<4-19,LESLIE>Yes. We usually talked every day,

154
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,140
<4-19,LESLIE>她没有打电话给我  我以为
<4-19,LESLIE>and when she didn't call, I just assumed

155
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,320
<4-19,LESLIE>她在忙案子什么的  可...
<4-19,LESLIE>she was busy with a case or something, but...

156
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,310
<4-19,LESLIE>或许她是有什么别的事
<4-19,LESLIE>Maybe there was something else going on.

157
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,080
<5-1,BECKETT>好  拜拜
<5-1,BECKETT>Okay, bye.

158
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,280
<5-2,BECKETT>谢谢  是莱恩来电
<5-2,BECKETT>Hey. Thank you. So that was Ryan.

159
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,240
<5-2,BECKETT>他刚离开动物管制所
<5-2,BECKETT>He just left Animal Control,

160
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,900
<5-2,BECKETT>最近公园只有一起动物走失报告
<5-2,BECKETT>and there was only one recent report of an animal loose in the park--

161
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,260
<5-2,BECKETT>一只小猎犬  叫弗雷德
<5-2,BECKETT>A beagle named Fred.

162
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,790
<5-3,CASTLE>那么要么弗雷德是一只狂暴的猎犬
<5-3,CASTLE>Well, either Fred is one vicious beagle

163
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,790
<5-3,CASTLE>要么另有隐情
<5-3,CASTLE>or this mystery has just deepened.

164
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,220
<5-4,CASTLE>一个精力充沛的律师
<5-4,CASTLE>How does a high-powered lawyer

165
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,190
<5-4,CASTLE>怎么会穿着小红帽的服装死去的呢
<5-4,CASTLE>end up dead in a red riding hood costume?

166
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,400
<5-4,CASTLE>艾米的工作压力大强度高  对吗
<5-4,CASTLE>Amy worked long hours under high pressure, right?

167
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,680
<5-4,CASTLE>那如果她有她姐姐不知道的
<5-4,CASTLE>What if she had a secret way of letting off steam

168
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,390
<5-4,CASTLE>秘密宣泄压力的途径呢
<5-4,CASTLE>that even her sister didn't know about?

169
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,040
<5-5,BECKETT>举个例子
<5-5,BECKETT>Like what?

170
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,740
<5-6,CASTLE>有一个成年角色扮演亚文化群体
<5-6,CASTLE>There's this whole adult role-playing subculture

171
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,990
<5-6,CASTLE>对童话十分痴迷
<5-6,CASTLE>obsessed with fairy tales.

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
<5-7,CASTLE>不  不是那种角色扮演
<5-7,CASTLE>No, not that kind of adult role play,

173
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,150
<5-7,CASTLE>不过  也有那种的
<5-7,CASTLE>although, there is that one, too.

174
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,660
<5-8,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<5-8,BECKETT>And you know this how?

175
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,290
<5-9,CASTLE>做过一点研究
<5-9,CASTLE>Did a little research.

176
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,990
<5-9,CASTLE>牧羊女啊
<5-9,CASTLE>Bo peep.

177
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,300
<5-9,CASTLE>反正  这些人
<5-9,CASTLE>Anyway, these people

178
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,390
<5-9,CASTLE>穿上特定的服装进行角色扮演
<5-9,CASTLE>get dressed in the outfits, they play the characters,

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,210
<5-9,CASTLE>甚至将故事重演
<5-9,CASTLE>they even reenact the stories.

180
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,640
<5-9,CASTLE>或许艾米当时就在做这个
<5-9,CASTLE>Maybe that's what Amy was doing

181
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,370
<5-9,CASTLE>但是事情出了什么大岔子
<5-9,CASTLE>when everything went horribly and tragically wrong.

182
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,800
<5-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这理论出乎意料的合情合理
<5-10,BECKETT>Castle, that is a surprisingly reasonable

183
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,150
<5-10,BECKETT>而且很有根据啊
<5-10,BECKETT>and grounded theory.

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,100
<5-10,BECKETT>是啊
<5-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

185
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,860
<5-11,CASTLE>坦白说  我对自己有点失望
<5-11,CASTLE>Frankly, I'm a little disappointed in myself.

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,370
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我们也是  兄弟
<5-12,ESPOSITO>We all are, bro.

187
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,540
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我刚才查艾米的财务支出
<5-12,ESPOSITO>So I was going over Amy's financials

188
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,140
<5-12,ESPOSITO>看有没有不寻常的花销时
<5-12,ESPOSITO>for any unusual activity.

189
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,110
<5-12,ESPOSITO>发现四天前  她从存款中
<5-12,ESPOSITO>4 days ago, she took out $50,605

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,930
<5-12,ESPOSITO>取出了50605美元的现金
<5-12,ESPOSITO>from her savings, all in cash.

191
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,140
<5-12,ESPOSITO>50605美元吗
<5-12,ESPOSITO>$50,605?

192
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,010
<5-13,CASTLE>提出这个数目的款项很奇怪  更别说现金
<5-13,CASTLE>That's an odd amount for a withdrawal, especially in cash.

193
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,090
<5-14,ESPOSITO>是啊  还不止
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, not only that,

194
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,950
<5-14,ESPOSITO>这五万块  不在她公寓里
<5-14,ESPOSITO>but the 50k, it's not in her apartment,

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,660
<5-14,ESPOSITO>也没法与任何近期消费关联上
<5-14,ESPOSITO>and I can't tie it to any recent purchases.

196
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,510
<5-15,BECKETT>联系她的银行
<5-15,BECKETT>Contact her bank.

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,020
<5-15,BECKETT>看他们是否知道她提款的目的
<5-15,BECKETT>see if they know why she made that withdrawal.

198
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,010
<5-16,ESPOSITO>如你所愿
<5-16,ESPOSITO>As you wish.

199
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,840
<5-17,BECKETT>蕾妮那儿有消息了
<5-17,BECKETT>Oh, Lanie's got news for us.

200
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,140
<6-1,LANIE>我确实有消息
<6-1,LANIE>Oh, I've got news, all right,

201
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,740
<6-1,LANIE>不过我想你不会开心的
<6-1,LANIE>but I'm not sure you're gonna like it.

202
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,540
<6-1,LANIE>我在死者手臂上的伤口里
<6-1,LANIE>I found hairs like this one

203
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,280
<6-1,LANIE>找到了这样的毛发
<6-1,LANIE>in a wound on the victim's arm.

204
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,500
<6-1,LANIE>这不是她的  所以我查了DNA
<6-1,LANIE>It didn't come from her, so I ran D.N.A.

205
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,470
<6-2,BECKETT>查到匹配结果了吗
<6-2,BECKETT>Did we get a match?

206
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,930
<6-3,LANIE>那不是人类毛发  是狼毛
<6-3,LANIE>The hair isn't human. It's wolf hair.

207
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,770
<6-5,LANIE>淡定  卡塞尔  我还没说完
<6-5,LANIE>Simmer down, Castle. I'm not done with the story.

208
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,940
<6-6,CASTLE>抱歉  还有呢
<6-6,CASTLE>Sorry. What's the rest of it?

209
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,290
<6-7,LANIE>从伤口的深度和长度来看
<6-7,LANIE>Well, from the depth and the length of the gashes,

210
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,240
<6-7,LANIE>所有伤口应该都是同一只爪子造成的
<6-7,LANIE>it looks like the marks were made by only one claw.

211
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,590
<6-8,CASTLE>独臂狼
<6-8,CASTLE>A one-legged wolf?

212
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
<6-9,LANIE>我觉得不是狼干的
<6-9,LANIE>I don't think it's a wolf at all.

213
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,470
<6-10,CASTLE>那怎么解释狼毛和爪痕
<6-10,CASTLE>But the hair and the claw?

214
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,520
<6-11,BECKETT>凶手想让我们误以为是狼
<6-11,BECKETT>The killer wanted us to think it was a wolf

215
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,290
<6-11,BECKETT>以摆脱我们
<6-11,BECKETT>to throw us off.

216
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,750
<6-12,LANIE>所以死者身上没有咬痕
<6-12,LANIE>Which would explain why there are no bite marks on the body.

217
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,260
<6-12,LANIE>伤口是人类凶手用狼爪子抓出来的
<6-12,LANIE>The goshes were flicked by human killer using a wolf claw.

218
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,360
<6-13,CASTLE>那真正死因是什么
<6-13,CASTLE>So then what's the real cause of death?

219
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,250
<6-14,LANIE>我找到两个新的针孔
<6-14,LANIE>Well, I found two fresh needle marks,

220
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,370
<6-14,LANIE>都在死者后背上
<6-14,LANIE>both on the victim's back,

221
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,420
<6-14,LANIE>这可不是她自己扎的
<6-14,LANIE>so she didn't put them there herself.

222
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,720
<6-15,BECKETT>她被下药了
<6-15,BECKETT>So she was drugged?

223
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,930
<6-15,BECKETT>有性侵犯痕迹吗
<6-15,BECKETT>Is there any signs of sexsual assault?

224
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,150
<6-16,LANIE>没有  但是毒检
<6-16,LANIE>No, but tox results

226
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,920
<6-16,LANIE>查到了含有氯胺酮和氧可酮
<6-16,LANIE>turned up ketamine and oxycodone.

227
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,400
<6-16,LANIE>我怀疑凶手给她注射了氯胺酮
<6-16,LANIE>I'm thinking our guy sedated her with the ketamine

228
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,020
<6-16,LANIE>然后给她穿上了服装
<6-16,LANIE>Then dressed her in the costume,

229
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,640
<6-16,LANIE>但是麻醉药的剂量没有把她彻底迷昏
<6-16,LANIE>but the dose didn't quite knock her out.

230
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,270
<6-17,BECKETT>所以说  她想逃离凶手的魔掌...
<6-17,BECKETT>So she tried to run away from her killer...

231
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,620
<6-18,LANIE>他抓到她时
<6-18,LANIE>And when he caught her,

232
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,470
<6-18,LANIE>又给她注射了氧可酮  导致她死亡
<6-18,LANIE>He dosed her with oxy, and it was lights out.

233
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,510
<7-1,BECKETT>药  还有爪子
<7-1,BECKETT>The drugs, the claw--

234
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,220
<7-1,BECKETT>这是有预谋的谋杀
<7-1,BECKETT>This is murder, planned and premeditated.

235
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,640
<7-1,BECKETT>凶手有意设计了犯罪现场
<7-1,BECKETT>I mean, the killer staged the crime scene

236
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,770
<7-1,BECKETT>好让人们想到小红帽
<7-1,BECKETT>to evoke images of little red riding hood.

237
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,080
<7-2,CASTLE>但是他为什么要这样做呢
<7-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but why would he do that?

238
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,500
<7-3,BECKETT>我其实不太关心为什么
<7-3,BECKETT>Well, I'm less concerned about why.

239
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,870
<7-3,BECKETT>我只关心是谁
<7-3,BECKETT>What I'm wondering is who.

240
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,660
<7-4,CASTLE>凶手一定先把艾米引进公园里
<7-4,CASTLE>So the killer must have lured Amy into the park.

241
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,110
<7-5,BECKETT>也就是说凶手一定是她认识和信任的人
<7-5,BECKETT>Which means he's someone that she knew and trusted.

242
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,040
<7-6,CASTLE>是啊  就像小红帽信任狼外婆一样
<7-6,CASTLE>Yeah, like red riding hood trusted her cute little granny.

243
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,500
<7-7,BECKETT>没错  莱恩  艾米的同事怎么说
<7-7,BECKETT>Yeah. Ryan, what did Amy's coworkers tell you?

244
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,360
<7-8,RYAN>他们说她最近非常不在状态
<7-8,RYAN>Uh, that, uh, she definitely wasn't herself lately.

245
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,710
<7-8,RYAN>上周五一点钟必须参加的员工会议她没到场
<7-8,RYAN>Said she'd been acting agitated since she missed a

246
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
<7-8,RYAN>那之后她就一直显得很焦虑
<7-8,RYAN>mandatory 1:00 staff meeting last friday.

247
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,150
<7-8,RYAN>她说有私事要办
<7-8,RYAN>Said it was for personal reasons.

248
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,490
<7-9,BECKETT>她也是从那时起不给姐姐打电话的
<7-9,BECKETT>That's the same time that Amy stopped calling her sister.

249
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,260
<7-9,BECKETT>莱恩  去查查她的邮件和通话记录
<7-9,BECKETT>Ryan, can you look into her e-mails and phone calls?

250
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,590
<7-9,BECKETT>我要知道她到底出了什么事
<7-9,BECKETT>I want to know what was going on with her.

251
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,510
<7-10,RYAN>是
<7-10,RYAN>Yep.

252
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,910
<7-10,RYAN>贝克特
<7-10,RYAN>Yo, Beckett.

253
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,420
<7-11,ESPOSITO>你得来看点东西
<7-11,ESPOSITO>There's something you need to see.

254
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,970
<8-1,CASTLE>在那儿
<8-1,CASTLE>Right over there.

255
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,270
<8-2,BECKETT>她手里拿的是我想的那东西吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Is that what I think it is in her hand?

256
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
<8-3,CASTLE>毒苹果
<8-3,CASTLE>A poisoned apple.

258
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,580
<8-4,BECKETT>她是白雪公主
<8-4,BECKETT>She's snow white.

259
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,430
<8-5,CASTLE>看来我们对付的是一个童话杀手
<8-5,CASTLE>It looks like we've got a fairy-tale killer on our hands.

269
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,700
<8-5,CASTLE>贝克特
<8-5,CASTLE>Yo, beckett.

270
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,390
<9-1,ESPOSITO>失陪
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Excuse me.

271
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,650
<9-2,BECKETT>她的医疗警示手环上有注明身份
<9-2,BECKETT>Her medicalert bracelet got us an I.D.

272
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,340
<9-3,ESPOSITO>她叫克里斯蒂娜·柯蒂斯  25岁
<9-3,ESPOSITO>She's Kristina Curtis, 25.

273
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,470
<9-3,ESPOSITO>住在上东区
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Lives on the upper east side.

274
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,300
<9-4,BECKETT>她有近亲吗
<9-4,BECKETT>Does she have next of kin?

275
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,360
<9-5,RYAN>有个丈夫  名叫诺亚·柯蒂斯
<9-5,RYAN>Yeah, her husband. His name's Noah Curtis.

276
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,250
<9-6,BECKETT>你们抽点时间去见见他
<9-6,BECKETT>Okay, I need you guys to take point on the interview.

277
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,560
<9-6,BECKETT>问问他对此是否知情
<9-6,BECKETT>Find out what he knows about this,

278
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,880
<9-6,BECKETT>看看克里斯蒂娜和另一个死者有没有关系
<9-6,BECKETT>and let'see if Kristina was connected to the other victim.

279
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,320
<9-7,RYAN>既然凶手给这些死者
<9-7,RYAN>You know, if our killer's dressing his victims

280
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,420
<9-7,RYAN>都穿上了服装
<9-7,RYAN>in these costumes,

281
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,460
<9-7,RYAN>我们一定能找到生产厂家
<9-7,RYAN>I bet we can I.D. the manufacturer

282
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,640
<9-7,RYAN>查明凶手是从哪里购得
<9-7,RYAN>and find out where he got 'em.

283
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,080
<9-8,BECKETT>好主意  你去查吧
<9-8,BECKETT>That's a good idea. You run with it.

284
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,190
<9-9,CASTLE>看这  肤白如雪
<9-9,CASTLE>Here it is. "White as snow,

285
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,840
<9-9,CASTLE>唇红如血  发黑如檀
<9-9,CASTLE>Red as blood, black as ebony."

286
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,310
<9-9,CASTLE>这家伙直接引用了
<9-9,CASTLE>This guy is quoting directly

287
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,150
<9-9,CASTLE>原版格林童话里面对白雪公主的描写
<9-9,CASTLE>from grimm's original "Snow white."

288
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,960
<9-10,BECKETT>也就是说重演童话的不是死者
<9-10,BECKETT>So our victims aren't reenacting the fairy tales,

289
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,350
<9-10,BECKETT>而是凶手
<9-10,BECKETT>The killer is.

290
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,700
<9-11,LANIE>不过她并非死于毒苹果
<9-11,LANIE>Only this woman didn't die from a poisoned apple.

291
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,600
<9-11,LANIE>她有和艾米·摩根一样的注射痕迹
<9-11,LANIE>She has the same injection marks as Amy Morgan.

292
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,970
<9-12,BECKETT>知道死亡时间了吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Do you have time of death?

293
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,870
<9-13,LANIE>今天凌晨五点到七点间
<9-13,LANIE>5:00 and 7:00 A.M. This morning.

294
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,660
<9-14,CASTLE>凶手杀了小红帽
<9-14,CASTLE>So he kills red riding hood,

295
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,760
<9-14,CASTLE>六个小时后就再次犯案
<9-14,CASTLE>Then six hours later, he strikes again?

296
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,830
<9-14,CASTLE>这个频率挺快的
<9-14,CASTLE>That's a pretty quick turnaround.

297
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,630
<9-15,BECKETT>符合连环杀手的特点
<9-15,BECKETT>It's all the markings of a serial killer.

298
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,670
<9-16,CASTLE>但是理论上来说
<9-16,CASTLE>Yeah, but technically,

299
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,640
<9-16,CASTLE>犯下三起谋杀才能被称为连环杀手
<9-16,CASTLE>You have to murder three times to be a serial killer.

300
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,490
<9-17,BECKETT>我们让他走不到那一步吧
<9-17,BECKETT>Yeah, well, let's make sure he never gets there.

301
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,100
<10-1,ESPOSITO>柯蒂斯先生  你最后一次见你妻子是什么时候
<10-1,ESPOSITO>When did you last see your wife, Mr. Curtis?

302
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,130
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>凌晨五点之前
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>Just before 5:00 A.M. When she--

303
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,340
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>她出去慢跑了
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>She left for her jog.

304
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,080
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>她跟我吻别
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>She--she gave me a kiss good-bye.

305
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,650
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>那是我最后一次见她
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>That was the last time I saw her.

306
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,970
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>真不敢相信她就这么走了
<10-2,NOAH CURTIS>I-I-I can't-- I can't believe she's gone.

307
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,630
<10-3,RYAN>柯蒂斯先生  她跑步的事
<10-3,RYAN>Mr. Curtis, this run she took,

308
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,970
<10-3,RYAN>还有别人知道吗
<10-3,RYAN>who else knew she was going?

309
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,790
<10-4,NOAH>其他在公园慢跑的人吧
<10-4,NOAH>Other joggers in the park, I guess.

310
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,000
<10-4,NOAH>她每天都去  风雨无阻
<10-4,NOAH>She--she went every morning, even in the snow.

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,470
<10-4,NOAH>一天不落
<10-4,NOAH>She--she never missed a day.

312
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,680
<10-5,ESPOSITO>她跟哪个慢跑者有矛盾吗
<10-5,ESPOSITO>She have problems with any of the other joggers?

313
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,420
<10-6,NOAH>没有  至少她没跟我说过
<10-6,NOAH>No, not that she told me.

314
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,940
<10-7,RYAN>她提过有人尾随或监视她吗
<10-7,RYAN>Did she ever mention being followed or watched?

315
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
<10-8,NOAH>你是说有人在跟踪她吗
<10-8,NOAH>Are you saying someone was stalking her?

316
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,400
<10-9,RYAN>现在这种情况
<10-9,RYAN>Under the circumstances,

317
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,410
<10-9,RYAN>看起来不像是随机攻击
<10-9,RYAN>this doesn't look like a random attack.

318
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,930
<10-9,RYAN>你妻子的职业是什么
<10-9,RYAN>What did your wife do for a living?

319
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,150
<10-10,NOAH>她在第五大道上开一家画廊
<10-10,NOAH>She owned an art gallery on fifth avenue.

320
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,140
<10-10,NOAH>是家族产业  从她爸爸那里继承的
<10-10,NOAH>It's family owned, she took it over from her dad.

321
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,150
<10-10,NOAH>你见过这个女人吗
<10-10,NOAH>Did you ever see this woman before

322
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,810
<10-11,ESPOSITO>或是听过艾米·摩根这个名字吗
<10-11,ESPOSITO>or heard the name Amy Morgan?

323
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,640
<10-12,NOAH>没有  怎么了  她是谁
<10-12,NOAH>No, I don't think so. Why? Who is she?

324
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,520
<10-13,ESPOSITO>她是另一个被害人
<10-13,ESPOSITO>She's another victim, Mr. Curtis.

325
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,230
<10-13,ESPOSITO>她会不会是克里斯蒂娜认识的人
<10-13,ESPOSITO>Could she be an acquaintance of Kristina's?

326
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,780
<10-14,NOAH>我不认识她  对不起
<10-14,NOAH>I don't recognize her. I'm sorry.

327
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,890
<10-15,RYAN>克里斯蒂娜最近有没有什么奇怪的地方
<10-15,RYAN>Did you notice anything unusual about Kristina lately,

328
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,590
<10-15,RYAN>比如她的心情  她说过或做过什么吗
<10-15,RYAN>Her--her state of mind, maybe something she said or did?

329
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,670
<10-16,NOAH>上周有件奇怪的事
<10-16,NOAH>There was something strange last week.

330
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,420
<10-16,NOAH>周五我们本来要一起吃午饭的
<10-16,NOAH>We were supposed to have lunch on friday.

331
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,740
<10-16,NOAH>但是她没来
<10-16,NOAH>But she didn't show.

332
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,460
<10-16,NOAH>之后她打电话给我  说她去了画廊
<10-16,NOAH>She called later to say she went to the art gallery

333
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,030
<10-16,NOAH>有些紧急事务要处理
<10-16,NOAH>for a last-minute emergency.

334
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,250
<10-17,RYAN>上周五  你们的午饭定在下午一点了吗
<10-17,RYAN>Last friday? Was your lunch at 1:00 P.M.?

335
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,420
<10-18,NOAH>是的
<10-18,NOAH>Yeah. Yeah, it was.

336
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,310
<10-18,NOAH>怎么了
<10-18,NOAH>W-why?

337
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,980
<11-1,RYAN>对于为什么没去赴约
<11-1,RYAN>Kristina lied to her husband

338
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,910
<11-1,RYAN>克里斯蒂娜骗了她丈夫
<11-1,RYAN>about why she missed their lunch.

339
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,620
<11-1,RYAN>她上周五没去画廊
<11-1,RYAN>She wasn't at the art gallery last friday.

340
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,650
<11-1,RYAN>画廊的人也不知道她在哪
<11-1,RYAN>They don't know where she was.

341
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,210
<11-2,BECKETT>我们的两个死者  都在被杀前不久
<11-2,BECKETT>Okay, so both of our victims were unaccounted for

342
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,680
<11-2,BECKETT>在同一时间不知所踪
<11-2,BECKETT>at exactly the same time shortly before they got killed.

343
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,910
<11-2,BECKETT>她们到底去哪了
<11-2,BECKETT>So where did they go?

344
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,330
<11-3,RYAN>还不知道  不好意思
<11-3,RYAN>Yeah, still working on it. Excuse me.

345
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,420
<11-3,RYAN>是的  我是莱恩
<11-3,RYAN>Mm-hmm.Yeah, ryan here.

346
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,830
<11-4,CASTLE>说不定她们认识对方
<11-4,CASTLE>Maybe they knew each other.

347
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,570
<11-5,BECKETT>她们的家人说她们互相不认识
<11-5,BECKETT>No, their family said they didn't know each other.

348
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,320
<11-5,BECKETT>她们的职业完全不同
<11-5,BECKETT>They had completely different careers,

349
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,020
<11-5,BECKETT>住的地方也不近
<11-5,BECKETT>and they lived in different parts of town.

350
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,970
<11-5,BECKETT>似乎她们的生活从未有过交集
<11-5,BECKETT>It seems like their lives never really intersected.

351
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,030
<11-6,CASTLE>直到她们被同一个杀手杀死
<11-6,CASTLE>Mm, until they both died at the hand of the same killer.

352
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,730
<11-7,BECKETT>为什么要选这两个人呢
<11-7,BECKETT>So why these two women

353
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,270
<11-7,BECKETT>为什么要用童话桥段
<11-7,BECKETT>and why fairy tales?

354
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,500
<11-7,BECKETT>凶手是喜欢随机作案
<11-7,BECKETT>Did the killer have some kind of a random obsession

355
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,400
<11-7,BECKETT>还是这里面有更深的含义
<11-7,BECKETT>or was there a deeper meaning behind all of it?

356
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,140
<11-8,CASTLE>我觉得他想用她们的尸体讲故事
<11-8,CASTLE>Well, I think he's trying to tell a story with these bodies.

357
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,640
<11-8,CASTLE>只是我还不知道故事内容
<11-8,CASTLE>I just don't know what it is yet.

358
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,750
<11-9,ESPOSITO>也许是为了钱
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe it's about money.

359
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,770
<11-9,ESPOSITO>克里斯蒂娜突然从她信托账户提款
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Turns out Kristina raided her trust account.

360
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,130
<11-9,ESPOSITO>猜猜她取了多少钱
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Guess how much she took out?

361
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,240
<11-9,ESPOSITO>50605美元
<11-9,ESPOSITO>$50,605.

362
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,850
<11-10,CASTLE>两名死者都在周五神秘失踪了一段时间
<11-10,CASTLE>So both victims go awol on Friday

363
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,800
<11-10,CASTLE>还都取了相同数额的现金
<11-10,CASTLE>and both pull out the exact same amount of cash.

364
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,600
<11-10,CASTLE>这绝不是巧合
<11-10,CASTLE>That's not a coincidence.

365
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,710
<11-11,BECKETT>这就是她俩的联系
<11-11,BECKETT>That is a connection.

366
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,180
<11-11,BECKETT>你能不能联系克里斯蒂娜的家人
<11-11,BECKETT>Can you get ahold of Kristina's family,

367
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,620
<11-11,BECKETT>看他们知不知道她为什么取那些钱
<11-11,BECKETT>see if they know why she might have needed that money?

368
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,760
<11-12,ESPOSITO>我去找丈夫谈谈
<11-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'll reach out to the husband.

369
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,390
<11-14,BECKETT>谢了  莱恩  你有什么发现
<11-14,BECKETT>Thanks. Ryan, what did you find out?

370
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,570
<11-15,RYAN>我可能找到了指向凶手的道路
<11-15,RYAN>I think I might have found the pathway to our killer.

371
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,490
<11-15,RYAN>白雪公主和小红帽的服装
<11-15,RYAN>Those snow white and red riding hood outfits--

372
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,020
<11-15,RYAN>都是由一个工厂生产的
<11-15,RYAN>They were made by the same manufacturer.

373
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,120
<11-16,BECKETT>知道在哪卖吗
<11-16,BECKETT>Do you know where they were sold?

374
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,920
<11-17,RYAN>我还在等服装的卖家名单
<11-17,RYAN>I'm still waiting for a list of stores that carry the costumes,

375
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,400
<11-17,RYAN>网店和实体店都有
<11-17,RYAN>both online and brick and mortar.

376
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,910
<11-17,RYAN>到早上应该就有结果了
<11-17,RYAN>We should have some answers by the morning.

377
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,520
<12-1,MARTHA>感觉不太对  马库斯
<12-1,MARTHA>This just doesn't feel right, Marcs.

378
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,140
<12-1,MARTHA>把那把椅子移到那边去
<12-1,MARTHA>Move that chair over there.

379
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,910
<12-1,MARTHA>理查德  你回来的正是时候
<12-1,MARTHA>Richard, your timing is perfect.

380
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,090
<12-1,MARTHA>我们正需要帮手
<12-1,MARTHA>We could use your help.

381
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,680
<12-2,CASTLE>帮你们违背我的意愿移动家具吗
<12-2,CASTLE>Moving my furniture where I don't want it to go?

382
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,830
<12-3,MARTHA>只是暂时的
<12-3,MARTHA>It's just temporary.

383
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,130
<12-3,MARTHA>我们明晚要在这办我独角戏的
<12-3,MARTHA>We're having a staged reading of my one-woman show,

384
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,110
<12-3,MARTHA>舞台读本
<12-3,MARTHA>here, tomorrow night.

385
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,150
<12-4,CASTLE>真可惜你没有自己的工作室
<12-4,CASTLE>Ah, it's too bad you don't have an acting studio

386
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,410
<12-4,CASTLE>可以来做这些事
<12-4,CASTLE>to do this kind of thing in.

387
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,330
<12-4,CASTLE>等一下  你有啊
<12-4,CASTLE>Oh, wait. You do.

388
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,460
<12-5,MARTHA>那个小黑箱子一样的地方不适合做这个
<12-5,MARTHA>The little black box theater is not right for this, dear.

389
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,850
<12-5,MARTHA>我们需要一个亲密的环境
<12-5,MARTHA>It needs something much more intimate.

390
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,620
<12-6,MARCUS>会很新潮的
<12-6,MARCUS>It'll be very avant-garde.

391
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,830
<12-6,MARCUS>没错
<12-6,MARCUS>Exactly.

392
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,810
<12-7,MARTHA>我觉得这把椅子该放这里  马库斯
<12-7,MARTHA>Now I think this chair should be here, Marcus.

393
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,640
<12-7,MARTHA>我想营造出一种...
<12-7,MARTHA>I want to create a...

394
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,770
<12-8,CASTLE>亲爱的  你就不能阻止她吗
<12-8,CASTLE>Sweetie, couldn't you have done something to discourage this?

395
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,730
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>我试过了  爸  但她让我担任舞台监督
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>I tried, dad, but she made me stage manager.

396
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,300
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>其实没你想得那么糟
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>Look, it's not as bad as you think.

397
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,980
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>也就二  三十个人
<12-9,ALEXIS CASTLE>Just 20 or 30 people...

398
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,110
<12-11,ALEXIS>我们会把一切放回原位
<12-11,ALEXIS>And we'll put everything back.

399
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,810
<12-11,ALEXIS>这部剧对奶奶来说很重要
<12-11,ALEXIS>This play means a lot to gramma,

400
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,730
<12-11,ALEXIS>而且剧确实很棒
<12-11,ALEXIS>and it's actually really good.

401
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,260
<12-11,ALEXIS>现在我知道了很多我以前不知道的她的事
<12-11,ALEXIS>Now I understand things about her I never did before,

403
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,890
<12-12,ALEXIS>还有你的事
<12-12,ALEXIS>and about you, too.

404
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,970
<12-13,CASTLE>我的
<12-13,CASTLE>About me?

405
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,750
<12-14,MARTHA>不不不
<12-14,MARTHA>No, no, no, no.

407
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,670
<12-14,MARTHA>这里  这里还需要再大点
<12-14,MARTHA>This-- this space needs to be bigger.

408
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,900
<12-14,MARTHA>演员需要大空间
<12-14,MARTHA>An actor needs space.

409
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,700
<12-15,CASTLE>"理查德一直有阴暗的想象力
<12-15,CASTLE>"Richard always had a dark imagination.

410
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,850
<12-15,CASTLE>他注定了要么做个连环杀手
<12-15,CASTLE>He was destined either to become a serial killer

411
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,610
<12-15,CASTLE>要么做个侦探小说家"  妈  真的假的
<12-15,CASTLE>or a mystery writer." Mother, really?

412
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,620
<12-16,MARTHA>只是稍微夸张了点
<12-16,MARTHA>Oh, it's just a slight exaggeration.

413
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,900
<12-17,CASTLE>那根据这段
<12-17,CASTLE>And according to this,

414
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,350
<12-17,CASTLE>你对我写作生涯的起步有关键的影响...
<12-17,CASTLE>you're responsible for launching my writing career by...

415
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,120
<12-17,CASTLE>你和我第一个出版商上床了
<12-17,CASTLE>You slept with my first publisher?

416
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,670
<12-18,MARCUS>卡塞尔先生  我相信凭你的才能
<12-18,MARCUS>Mr. Castle, I'm sure your talent

417
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,030
<12-18,MARCUS>你终究会功成名就
<12-18,MARCUS>would've gotten you there eventually.

418
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,580
<12-19,CASTLE>确实是我的才能让我功成名就
<12-19,CASTLE>My talent did get me there.

419
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,540
<12-19,CASTLE>我不是因为她才得以出书的
<12-19,CASTLE>I didn't get published because of her.

420
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,800
<12-20,MARTHA>其实在你出书之后  我才和他上的床
<12-20,MARTHA>Technically, I slept with him after your book was out.

421
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,990
<12-20,MARTHA>但这样写更淫荡点
<12-20,MARTHA>This is just to be more salacious.

422
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,610
<12-21,CASTLE>他那时不是和我差不多大吗
<12-21,CASTLE>Wasn't he practically my age?

423
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,350
<12-22,MARTHA>亲爱的  你知道我一直都喜欢年轻人
<12-22,MARTHA>Honey, you know I've always loved younger men.

424
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,900
<12-22,MARTHA>他们是如此的精力充沛  能跟得上我的"步伐"
<12-22,MARTHA>They have so much energy, enough to keep up with me...

425
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,420
<12-22,MARTHA>大多数时候能吧
<12-22,MARTHA>most of the time.

426
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,240
<12-22,MARTHA>我要...
<12-22,MARTHA>I'm gonna...

427
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,000
<12-23,CASTLE>去喝杯苏格兰威士忌
<12-23,CASTLE>erase that image from my mind

428
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,300
<12-23,CASTLE>以消除我脑海浮现出的场景
<12-23,CASTLE>with a bottle of Scotch.

429
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,620
<12-24,MARTHA>亲爱的
<12-24,MARTHA>Oh, darling,

430
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,830
<12-24,MARTHA>我还邀请了贝克特参加明晚的读本
<12-24,MARTHA>I invited Beckett to the reading tomorrow night,

431
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,280
<12-24,MARTHA>所以你们或许可能把这当做约会
<12-24,MARTHA>so you two might want to make a date of it.

432
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,480
<13-1,BECKETT>我该怎么办
<13-1,BECKETT>What was I supposed to do,

433
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,300
<13-1,BECKETT>拒绝吗
<13-1,BECKETT>say no?

434
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,630
<13-2,CASTLE>对
<13-2,CASTLE>Yes.

435
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,850
<13-3,BECKETT>为什么你如此抗拒你妈妈的剧
<13-3,BECKETT>Why are you so against your mom's play?

436
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,650
<13-4,CASTLE>因为她在篡改历史
<13-4,CASTLE>Because she's rewriting history--

437
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,520
<13-4,CASTLE>篡改我的历史
<13-4,CASTLE>my history.

438
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,730
<13-4,CASTLE>相信我  我是亲身经历过
<13-4,CASTLE>Trust me, I lived through it.

439
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,610
<13-4,CASTLE>她把这一切都改得像是她的个人童话
<13-4,CASTLE>She's making it sound like it's her own personal fairy tale.

440
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,750
<13-5,BECKETT>这么说  你不喜欢别人根据你的生活
<13-5,BECKETT>Oh, so you don't like it when someone writes

441
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,000
<13-5,BECKETT>写出他们眼中的故事
<13-5,BECKETT>their own version of your life?

442
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,060
<13-5,BECKETT>真有意思
<13-5,BECKETT>Interesting.

443
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,830
<13-6,CASTLE>你是在指妮基·希特系列吗
<13-6,CASTLE>Okay, are you referring to the Nikki Heat books?

444
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,200
<13-6,CASTLE>这可完全不同
<13-6,CASTLE>Because this is completely different.

445
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,040
<13-7,BECKETT>哪里不同
<13-7,BECKETT>How is it different?

446
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,590
<13-8,CASTLE>首先  我没说过
<13-8,CASTLE>Well, for one thing, I'm not claiming

447
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,190
<13-8,CASTLE>我所写的故事是真实存在的
<13-8,CASTLE>that what I write is actually true.

448
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,650
<13-9,BECKETT>她也没说过吧
<13-9,BECKETT>Well, I don't think she is either.

449
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,390
<13-9,BECKETT>得了吧  卡塞尔  你自己也说过
<13-9,BECKETT>Come on, Castle, you said so yourself,

450
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,290
<13-9,BECKETT>所有人都需要一个童话
<13-9,BECKETT>everyone needs a fairy tale.

451
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,180
<13-9,BECKETT>让你妈有一个童话又有什么害处呢
<13-9,BECKETT>What's the harm in letting your mom have one of her own?

452
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,040
<13-10,CASTLE>好吧  不如换个
<13-10,CASTLE>Okay, let's-- let's change the subject

453
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,530
<13-10,CASTLE>不会让我气得溃疡的话题吧
<13-10,CASTLE>to something less likely to give me an ulcer.

454
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,870
<13-10,CASTLE>神秘的50605美元查得如何了
<13-10,CASTLE>How about that mysterious $50,605?

455
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,680
<13-10,CASTLE>好吧
<13-10,CASTLE>Okay.

456
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,420
<13-11,BECKETT>我们几乎找过所有与艾米
<13-11,BECKETT>Um, well, we talked to pretty much everyone

457
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,760
<13-11,BECKETT>和克里斯蒂娜关系亲密的人谈话
<13-11,BECKETT>close to Amy and Kristina,

458
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,470
<13-11,BECKETT>但没人知道她们为何会取出那笔钱
<13-11,BECKETT>and no one seems to know why they pulled out that money.

459
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,240
<13-12,CASTLE>那周五下午一点  她们去了哪里
<13-12,CASTLE>What about where they were at 1:00 p.m. on Friday?

460
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
<13-13,BECKETT>在艾米的邮件和电话上
<13-13,BECKETT>Nothing popped on Amy's e-mail

461
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,780
<13-13,BECKETT>都没有发现
<13-13,BECKETT>or phone calls,

462
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,340
<13-13,BECKETT>技术部还在彻查克里斯蒂娜的电脑
<13-13,BECKETT>and the techs are still going through Kristina's computer.

463
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,150

<15-9,RYAN>是的
<15-9,RYAN>Yes, they are.

510
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,240
<15-10,ESPOSITO>那有收到过童话服装的包裹吗
<15-10,ESPOSITO>What about a delivery of fairy-tale costumes?

511
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,200
<15-11,JAMIE>童话服装
<15-11,JAMIE>Fairy-tale costumes?

512
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,330
<15-12,RYAN>根据我们的记录
<15-12,RYAN>According to our records,

513
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,780
<15-12,RYAN>你上周在网上订购了三套服装
<15-12,RYAN>you ordered three from a web site last week.

514
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,410
<15-13,JAMIE>真是胡说八道
<15-13,JAMIE>Well, that's just ridiculous.

515
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,030
<15-13,JAMIE>我要这些童话服装干什么
<15-13,JAMIE>What would I do with fairy-tale costumes?

516
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,550
<15-14,RYAN>不知道啊
<15-14,RYAN>Can't imagine.

517
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,430
<15-15,ESPOSITO>这么说  你没从网上订过任何服装吗
<15-15,ESPOSITO>So you didn't order any costumes from the Internet?

518
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,050
<15-16,JAMIE>我看上去像是喜欢浪费钱的那种人吗
<15-16,JAMIE>Do I look like someone who's in the habit of wasting money?

519
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,040
<15-16,JAMIE>我靠固定收入生活
<15-16,JAMIE>I- I'm on a fixed income.

520
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,480
<15-17,ESPOSITO>我留意到这幢大楼里
<15-17,ESPOSITO>Well, I happened to notice that you don't have

521
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,720
<15-17,ESPOSITO>没有门卫
<15-17,ESPOSITO>a doorman for this building.

522
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,370
<15-17,ESPOSITO>那你的包裹通常放在哪里
<15-17,ESPOSITO>So where are your packages left?

523
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,270
<15-18,JAMIE>大厅的邮箱旁边
<15-18,JAMIE>By the mailbox in the lobby.

524
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,250
<15-2,RYAN>伊萨克森夫人
<15-2,RYAN>Mrs. Isaacson,

525
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,860
<15-19,RYAN>你是否留意自己信用卡上有过异常支出
<15-19,RYAN>did you notice any, uh, unusual charges on your credit card?

526
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,530
<15-19,RYAN>有人能拿到你的卡吗
<15-19,RYAN>Anyone have access to it?

527
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,580
<15-20,JAMIE>除非他们对我"掘地三尺"
<15-20,JAMIE>Well, not unless they're digging for gold.

528
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,740
<15-20,JAMIE>这年头可要小心为上
<15-20,JAMIE>Can't be too safe these days.

529
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,740
<15-20,JAMIE>是啊
<15-20,JAMIE>Yeah.

530
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,200
<16-1,BECKETT>UPS证实  他们将一个服装包裹送去了
<16-1,BECKETT>So U.P.S. confirms that a package of costumes was dropped off

531
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,920
<16-1,BECKETT>伊萨克森夫人公寓楼的大厅里  但无人签收
<16-1,BECKETT>at Mrs. Isaacson's lobby, but nobody signed for it,

532
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
<16-1,BECKETT>这是买家的指示
<16-1,BECKETT>per buyer's instructions.

533
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,840
<16-2,RYAN>还有更多坏消息
<16-2,RYAN>Here's some more bad news--

534
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,200
<16-2,RYAN>大厅里外都未安装监控摄像头
<16-2,RYAN>No security cameras inside the lobby or outside.

535
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,590
<16-2,RYAN>依我们的观察
<16-2,RYAN>And from what we could tell,

536
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,960
<16-2,RYAN>这幢大楼安保措施非常不好
<16-2,RYAN>the building's not terribly secure.

537
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,000
<16-3,BECKETT>凶手八成知道这情况
<16-3,BECKETT>Our killer probably knew that.

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
<16-3,BECKETT>所以才把这里作为快递投递点
<16-3,BECKETT>That's why he used it as a delivery drop.

539
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,160
<16-4,RYAN>如果他知道老妇人的信用卡号码
<16-4,RYAN>Well, if he knew the old lady's credit card number,

540
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
<16-4,RYAN>也许就是她认识的人
<16-4,RYAN>maybe he knew her.

541
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,030
<16-5,CASTLE>可能  也有可能他只是在垃圾桶里
<16-5,CASTLE>Could be. Could be he just found

542
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,440
<16-5,CASTLE>发现了她的信用卡账单
<16-5,CASTLE>her credit card statements in the trash.

543
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
<16-5,CASTLE>老套伎俩  但很有效
<16-5,CASTLE>It's old school, but it's effective.

544
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,860
<16-6,BECKETT>伙计们  说不定
<16-6,BECKETT>You guys, for all we know,

545
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,100
<16-6,BECKETT>我们说话这当口  他已瞄准了睡美人
<16-6,BECKETT>he's targeting Sleeping Beauty as we speak.

546
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,470
<16-7,ESPOSITO>我查到了一些事
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Yo. I got something.

547
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,290
<16-7,ESPOSITO>还记得上周五克里斯蒂娜在午餐时不见踪影吗
<16-7,ESPOSITO>That missing hour of Kristina's at lunch time last Friday?

548
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,660
<16-7,ESPOSITO>技术部发现她在那天12点50分时
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Tech found a map search on her tablet that day

549
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,990
<16-7,ESPOSITO>用平板电脑查了路线
<16-7,ESPOSITO>at 12:50 p.m.--

550
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,460
<16-7,ESPOSITO>路线终点是上西区的格拉斯曼咖啡馆
<16-7,ESPOSITO>walking directions to Glassman's cafe on the upper west side.

551
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,740
<16-8,BECKETT>好极了  你们俩去咖啡馆
<16-8,BECKETT>Okay, great. You guys go to the cafe.

552
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,560
<16-8,BECKETT>看看是否能查出她与谁见面
<16-8,BECKETT>See if you can figure out who she was meeting with.

553
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
<16-9,ESPOSITO>知道了
<16-9,ESPOSITO>On it.

554
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,490
<16-10,BECKETT>同时  我要联系巡警
<16-10,BECKETT>In the meantime, I'm gonna get ahold of uniforms

555
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,590
<16-10,BECKETT>要求他们在公园里加派巡逻人员
<16-10,BECKETT>and ask them to double foot patrols in parks.

556
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,920
<16-11,CASTLE>不过他这次不会在公园里犯案了
<16-11,CASTLE>Only he's not gonna strike at a park this time.

557
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,820
<16-11,CASTLE>格林童话里  小红帽和白雪公主
<16-11,CASTLE>In the Grimm stories, Red Riding Hood and Snow White

558
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,330
<16-11,CASTLE>都是在树林里被发现的
<16-11,CASTLE>were found in the woods,

559
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,770
<16-11,CASTLE>但睡美人...
<16-11,CASTLE>but Sleeping Beauty...

560
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,260
<16-12,BECKETT>却是在自己的卧室里
<16-12,BECKETT>Was found in her bedroom.

561
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,700
<16-13,CASTLE>没错
<16-13,CASTLE>Right.

562
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,930
<16-14,BECKETT>好极了  这就把范围缩小至几百万间公寓
<16-14,BECKETT>Great. So that narrows it down to several million apartments,

563
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,640
<16-14,BECKETT>这还只是在曼哈顿范围内
<16-14,BECKETT>and that is just in Manhattan.

564
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,470
<16-15,CASTLE>讲不通啊
<16-15,CASTLE>It doesn't make sense.

565
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,790
<16-16,BECKETT>什么东西讲不通
<16-16,BECKETT>What doesn't make any sense?

566
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,310
<16-17,CASTLE>他的动机
<16-17,CASTLE>His motive.

567
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,610
<16-17,CASTLE>所有的连环杀手都是在表达他们的心理冲动
<16-17,CASTLE>All serial killers are expressing some psychological impulse.

568
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,240
<16-17,CASTLE>在他们内心深处
<16-17,CASTLE>Somewhere deep down,

569
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,780
<16-17,CASTLE>对他们的疯狂行为自有一套扭曲的逻辑
<16-17,CASTLE>there's a twisted logic to their insanity.

570
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,800
<16-18,BECKETT>好吧  说下去
<16-18,BECKETT>Okay. Keep going.

571
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,440
<16-19,CASTLE>在原版格林童话里
<16-19,CASTLE>In the original Grimm's tales,

572
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,880
<16-19,CASTLE>小红帽  白雪公主和睡美人
<16-19,CASTLE>Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty--

573
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,290
<16-19,CASTLE>她们尽管命悬一线
<16-19,CASTLE>they all end up near death,

574
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,420
<16-19,CASTLE>但最终都获救了
<16-19,CASTLE>but were saved at the last minute.

575
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,620
<16-20,BECKETT>看来他是想夺走死者的美满结局
<16-20,BECKETT>It's like he's trying to take away our victims' happy endings.

576
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,690
<16-21,CASTLE>对  不仅如此  他大可订购任何人物的服装
<16-21,CASTLE>Right. Not only that, but he could've ordered any costume,

577
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,920
<16-21,CASTLE>却唯独选了这几件
<16-21,CASTLE>but he picked these.

578
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,010
<16-21,CASTLE>他对细节很在意
<16-21,CASTLE>He took great care in the details--

579
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,180
<16-21,CASTLE>狼爪  苹果
<16-21,CASTLE>the wolf's claw, the apple.

580
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,200
<16-21,CASTLE>他是出于某种原因选择这些童话人物
<16-21,CASTLE>He chose these characters for a reason.

581
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,010
<16-21,CASTLE>选中这两个女人也是一样
<16-21,CASTLE>He chose these women for a reason.

582
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,490
<16-21,CASTLE>我只是  暂时想不出原因
<16-21,CASTLE>I just... haven't figured it out yet.

583
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,690
<16-22,BECKETT>不管什么原因  肯定跟她们
<16-22,BECKETT>Well, whatever it is, it has to be connected

584
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,530
<16-22,BECKETT>取的钱有关
<16-22,BECKETT>to the cash that they withdrew.

585
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,510
<16-23,CASTLE>或许是因为她们有健全的银行账户才被选上的
<16-23,CASTLE>Maybe he's choosing women with healthy bank accounts.

586
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,570
<16-24,BECKETT>银行
<16-24,BECKETT>Bank.

587
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,210
<16-25,CASTLE>怎么了
<16-25,CASTLE>Sorry?

588
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,750
<16-26,BECKETT>克里斯蒂娜和艾米都取了等量的现金
<16-26,BECKETT>Kristina and Amy both withdrew the same amount of money.

589
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,240
<16-26,BECKETT>或许睡美人也取了等量的钱
<16-26,BECKETT>Maybe our sleeping beauty did as well.

590
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,110
<16-27,CASTLE>国家税务局要求银行
<16-27,CASTLE>The I.R.S. requires banks

591
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,490
<16-27,CASTLE>上报任何超过一万美金的交易
<16-27,CASTLE>to report any transactions over $10,000,

592
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,670
<16-27,CASTLE>-也就是说有银行记录可查  -没错
<16-27,CASTLE>- so they would have a record of it. - Exactly.

593
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,260
<17-1,JESSE>没错  她来过
<17-1,JESSE>Yeah, she was here.

594
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,930
<17-1,JESSE>上周五的午餐高峰时期
<17-1,JESSE>It was last Friday, during the lunch rush,

595
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,180
<17-1,JESSE>就在我把番茄酱弄到新买的牛仔裤上之后
<17-1,JESSE>right after I spilled ketchup on my new jeans.

596
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,710
<17-1,JESSE>我那裤子三折买的  超实惠
<17-1,JESSE>They were 70% off-- amazing sale.

597
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,970
<17-2,ESPOSITO>她当时是一个人吗
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Was she by herself?

598
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,770
<17-3,JESSE>不是  一共有三个人
<17-3,JESSE>No, it was a party of three.

599
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,080
<17-4,RYAN>三个  你记不记得跟她一起的两个人
<17-4,RYAN>Three? Do you remember who else she was with?

600
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,690
<17-5,JESSE>是两个女的
<17-5,JESSE>Two other women.

601
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,850
<17-5,JESSE>我还从没被警察问过话呢
<17-5,JESSE>I've never been questioned by cops before.

602
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,250
<17-5,JESSE>我能把这事发到推特上吗
<17-5,JESSE>You mind if I tweet about this?

603
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,670
<17-6,RYAN>这个  还是别发了吧
<17-6,RYAN>Uh, yeah, yes, we-- we do mind.

604
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,920
<17-7,ESPOSITO>这是她的同伴之一吗
<17-7,ESPOSITO>This one of the women?

605
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,100
<17-7,ESPOSITO>没错
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

606
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,500
<17-8,JESSE>她们是罪犯吗
<17-8,JESSE>Are they criminals or something?

607
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,910
<17-8,JESSE>我感觉她们像是从上东区来的人
<17-8,JESSE>Cause I was getting more of an upper east side vibe.

609
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,270
<17-9,ESPOSITO>不是  不过第三个女的可能处境危险
<17-9,ESPOSITO>No, but this third woman may be in danger,

610
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,480
<17-9,ESPOSITO>所以我们必须尽快确认她的身份
<17-9,ESPOSITO>so we need to identify her as soon as possible.

611
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,070
<17-9,ESPOSITO>她是不是用信用卡付的钱
<17-9,ESPOSITO>Do you remember if she maybe paid with a credit card,

612
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,050
<17-9,ESPOSITO>你有记下她的名字吗
<17-9,ESPOSITO>maybe you caught her name?

613
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,470
<17-10,JESSE>没有  她们付的现金
<17-10,JESSE>Nope. They paid cash.

614
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,040
<17-11,RYAN>有没有一个男人跟她们一起
<17-11,RYAN>Was anyone else with them, a-a man?

615
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,360
<17-12,JESSE>没有
<17-12,JESSE>No.

616
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,780
<17-13,ESPOSITO>你有没有注意到是否有人在盯着她们
<17-13,ESPOSITO>Did you notice anyone watching them?

617
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,860
<17-14,JESSE>有一些顾客就盯着啊
<17-14,JESSE>Some of the other customers,

618
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,710
<17-14,JESSE>-因为她们在吵架  -在吵什么
<17-14,JESSE>- but only because they were arguing. - About what?

619
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,700
<17-16,JESSE>不知道  我想偷听来着
<17-16,JESSE>I don't know. I kind of tried to eavesdrop,

620
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,040
<17-16,JESSE>但是每次我走过她们旁边
<17-16,JESSE>but every time I went over there,

621
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,460
<17-16,JESSE>她们就狠狠地瞪我
<17-16,JESSE>they gave me the death stare.

622
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,970
<17-16,JESSE>不管她们在说什么
<17-16,JESSE>Whatever they were talking about,

623
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,740
<17-16,JESSE>都不希望被我听到
<17-16,JESSE>they didn't want me to hear.

624
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,500
<17-16,JESSE>国家税务局的报告
<17-16,JESSE>Okay, so the I.R.S. search

625

<18-1,BECKETT>Five of them were made by males,

<18-2,CASTLE>Well, Harper and Wilson are in their 50s.

635
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,590
<18-2,CASTLE>不符合侧写
<18-2,CASTLE>They don't fit the profile.

<18-5,RYAN>我们觉得她很可能就是罪犯的第三个目标
<18-5,RYAN>We think she might be our killer's third target.

643
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,140
<18-6,RYAN>没法确认她的身份
<18-6,RYAN>We didn't get an I.D.,

644
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,750
<18-6,RYAN>不过我们拿到了一个细致的描述

<18-9,CASTLE>夏洛特没接电话
<18-9,CASTLE>Charlotte isn't answering.

<19-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<19-1,CASTLE>Beckett!

652
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,820
<19-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<19-2,BECKETT>Castle?

653
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,110
<19-3,CASTLE>叫救护车  她还活着
<19-3,CASTLE>Call an ambulance. She's still alive.

654
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,130
<19-3,CASTLE>好的
<19-3,CASTLE>Okay, yeah.

655
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,850
<20-1,BECKETT>任何关于她的消息都及时通知我  谢谢
<20-1,BECKETT>Just keep me posted on her status. Thanks.

656
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,850
<20-1,BECKETT>急诊室打来的
<20-1,BECKETT>So that was the E.R..

657
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,480
<20-1,BECKETT>夏洛特情况稳定了  但还没醒
<20-1,BECKETT>Charlotte is stable but still unconscious.

658
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,550
<20-2,CASTLE>体内有氯胺酮和氧可酮吗
<20-2,CASTLE>Ketamine and oxycodone?

659
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,450
<20-3,BECKETT>对  如果没有及时治疗  她的心跳就会停止
<20-3,BECKETT>Yeah, and without that treatment, her heart could've stopped.

660
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,050
<20-3,BECKETT>医生说我们来的很及时
<20-3,BECKETT>The doctor said we got there just in time.

661
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,600
<20-4,CASTLE>就像童话里一样
<20-4,CASTLE>Just like in the fairy tale.

662
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,370
<20-5,BECKETT>怎么  觉得自己成了白马王子吗
<20-5,BECKETT>So, what, you're prince charming now?

663
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,010
<20-6,CASTLE>如果水晶鞋能找到主人的话
<20-6,CASTLE>Well, if the shoe fits...

664
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,300
<20-6,CASTLE>说笑的  我很高兴能有个幸福的大结局
<20-6,CASTLE>Nah. I'm just glad we had a happy ending.

665
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,100
<20-7,BECKETT>只有把恶魔打败了  关在地牢里
<20-7,BECKETT>Well, it won't be a happy ending until evil is vanquished

666
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,330
<20-7,BECKETT>才叫幸福的大结局
<20-7,BECKETT>and locked in the dungeon.

667
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,470
<20-8,CASTLE>我们就快抓到他了
<20-8,CASTLE>We're closing in on him.

668
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,210
<20-9,BECKETT>是啊  可他还是棋先一着
<20-9,BECKETT>Yeah, but he's still a step ahead.

669
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,300
<20-9,BECKETT>我希望他留下了一些证据
<20-9,BECKETT>I'm hoping that he left some kind of evidence behind.

670
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,030
<20-10,ESPOSITO>我们翻了个底朝天
<20-10,ESPOSITO>We've done a full sweep.

671
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,130
<20-10,ESPOSITO>没看到50605美元
<20-10,ESPOSITO>No sign of the $50,605.

672
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,060
<20-11,BECKETT>一套豪华私人公寓  还有那么多钱
<20-11,BECKETT>A luxury condo and that much money--

673
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,290
<20-11,BECKETT>这女孩干什么工作的
<20-11,BECKETT>What does this girl do for a living?

674
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,570
<20-12,ESPOSITO>她是一名高级经纪人
<20-12,ESPOSITO>She worked for a real estate firm

675
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,680
<20-12,ESPOSITO>在一家房地产公司工作
<20-12,ESPOSITO>as a high-end broker.

676
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,240
<20-12,ESPOSITO>如果你想买套公寓  没个一千万
<20-12,ESPOSITO>If you didn't have $10 mil to plunk down on an apartment,

677
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,420
<20-12,ESPOSITO>她是不会接待你的
<20-12,ESPOSITO>she wasn't your girl.

678
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,160
<20-13,CASTLE>好吧  一共三名女性
<20-13,CASTLE>Okay, so we got three women,

679
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,180
<20-13,CASTLE>都是二十多岁  事业有成
<20-13,CASTLE>all in their 20s, all successful.

680
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,100
<20-13,CASTLE>上周五秘密会面
<20-13,CASTLE>All have a secret meeting last Friday

681
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,400
<20-13,CASTLE>之后三人都从银行取了一样数量的现金
<20-13,CASTLE>and then pull the exact same amount of cash out of the bank.

682
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,480
<20-14,ESPOSITO>或许她们一起投资什么吧
<20-14,ESPOSITO>Maybe they were going in on something pulling their money.

683
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,160
<20-15,CASTLE>我觉得可以排除大乐透的可能性了
<20-15,CASTLE>I think we can safely rule out lotto tickets.

684
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,560
<20-16,BECKETT>不  我们肯定漏掉了什么
<20-16,BECKETT>No, there's gotta be something that we're missing,

685
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,830
<20-16,BECKETT>能把她们三个联系在一起的细节
<20-16,BECKETT>something that links the three of them together.

686
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,470
<20-17,RYAN>你们看看这个
<20-17,RYAN>Hey, guys. Look at this.

687
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,660
<20-17,RYAN>我在夏洛特的抽屉底下找到的
<20-17,RYAN>I found it at the bottom of one of Charlotte's drawers.

688
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,170
<20-18,RYAN>找到她们的联系了
<20-18,RYAN>We got our connection.

689
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,200
<20-19,BECKETT>艾米  夏洛特以及克里斯蒂娜
<20-19,BECKETT>Amy, Charlotte, and Kristina--

690
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,460
<20-19,BECKETT>三名被害人都在
<20-19,BECKETT>our three victims.

691
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,060
<20-20,CASTLE>都扮成童话人物
<20-20,CASTLE>All dressed as fairy-tale characters.

692
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,480
<20-21,BECKETT>没错  那时的穿着
<20-21,BECKETT>Yeah, dressed as the same characters

693
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,470
<20-21,BECKETT>跟凶手给她们穿的衣服一样
<20-21,BECKETT>that our killer dressed them as.

694
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,080
<20-22,CASTLE>看看日期
<20-22,CASTLE>Check out the date.

695
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,470
<20-22,CASTLE>05年5月6号
<20-22,CASTLE>"05/06/05."

696
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,800
<20-23,BECKETT>七年前
<20-23,BECKETT>That's seven years ago.

697
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,080
<20-24,CASTLE>没错  也正好跟她们取的钱是一个数
<20-24,CASTLE>Yeah, it's also the amount of money they withdrew.

699
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,330
<20-25,ESPOSITO>没错  50605刀
<20-25,ESPOSITO>Yeah, 50,605 bucks.

700
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,570
<20-26,RYAN>对  看看照片背面
<20-26,RYAN>Yeah, and, uh, check out the back.

701
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,290
<20-27,CASTLE>谁是最愧疚的人
<20-27,CASTLE>"Who's the guiltiest of them all?

702
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,290
<20-27,CASTLE>付钱  才能见到明天的太阳
<20-27,CASTLE>If you pay, you'll live to see another day."

703
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,980
<20-28,BECKETT>有人勒索她们
<20-28,BECKETT>They were being blackmailed?

704
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,750
<20-29,CASTLE>七年前的那天发生了某件事情
<20-29,CASTLE>Okay, so something happened on that date

705
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,710
<20-29,CASTLE>将她们联系了起来
<20-29,CASTLE>that connects them all.

706
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,280
<20-30,BECKETT>也正是这件事导致她们被谋杀
<20-30,BECKETT>Something that led to their murders.

707
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,370
<20-31,ESPOSITO>拍这张照片的人是谁
<20-31,ESPOSITO>So who's the guy taking the photo?

708
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,880
<20-32,BECKETT>或许他能告诉我们发生了什么
<20-32,BECKETT>Maybe he can tell us what happened.

709
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,500
<21-1,RYAN>鉴证组在这张照片上只找到一组指纹
<21-1,RYAN>C.S.U. only found one set of prints on the photo--

710
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,260
<21-1,RYAN>是夏洛特的  不过他们鉴定这照片
<21-1,RYAN>Charlotte's-- but they were able to determine

711
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,950
<21-1,RYAN>是过去两周内洗出来的
<21-1,RYAN>that it was developed within the last two weeks.

712
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,840
<21-2,CASTLE>这都能鉴定出来吗
<21-2,CASTLE>How can they do that?

713
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,000
<21-3,RYAN>照片是用机器洗的
<21-3,RYAN>Well, it's machine processed,

714
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,620
<21-3,RYAN>那种在药房杂货店里的机器
<21-3,RYAN>Like, you know, from a drug store?

715
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,810
<21-3,RYAN>照片后面有个机器印的控制代码
<21-3,RYAN>And there's a control code. Auto-printed on the back.

716
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,970
<21-4,BECKETT>能从这个代码查到这家店的地址吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Can we use the code to figure out where it was processed?

717
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,080
<21-5,RYAN>已经在查了
<21-5,RYAN>Yeah, already on it.

718
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,260
<21-5,RYAN>希望能查到是谁去印的照片
<21-5,RYAN>Hopefully, that'll get us who ordered the prints.

719
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,640
<21-6,BECKETT>这张照片是七年前拍的
<21-6,BECKETT>This photo was taken seven years ago.

720
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
<21-6,BECKETT>为什么直到现在才出现
<21-6,BECKETT>Why is it surfacing now?

721
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,450
<21-7,ESPOSITO>关于日期的事你说的没错
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Yo. You were right about the date.

722
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,510
<21-7,ESPOSITO>那天确实发生了一件事情
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Something did happen that night.

723
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,550
<21-7,ESPOSITO>警方还有报告记录
<21-7,ESPOSITO>There's even a police report.

724
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,750
<21-8,BECKETT>报告里该不会记录了白马王子的身份吧
<21-8,BECKETT>I don't suppose the report I.D.'s our prince charming.

725
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,130
<21-9,ESPOSITO>当然记录了  他叫欧文·托马斯
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Sure does. His name's Owen Thomas.

726
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,350
<21-9,ESPOSITO>不过他不可能是犯人
<21-9,ESPOSITO>But he can't be our suspect.

727
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,140
<21-9,ESPOSITO>因为他已经死了
<21-9,ESPOSITO>He's dead.

728
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,080
<21-9,ESPOSITO>七年前被杀的  就在05年5月6号
<21-9,ESPOSITO>He was killed 7 years ago-- May 6, 2005.

729
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,330
<21-10,CASTLE>05/06/05
<21-10,CASTLE>05/06/05.

730
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,670
<21-11,BECKETT>就在他们合照的那晚
<21-11,BECKETT>The night that the photo was taken.

731
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,530
<21-12,ESPOSITO>那天晚上欧文还参加了
<21-12,ESPOSITO>It's also the same night that Owen attended

732
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,590
<21-12,ESPOSITO>一个以童话为主题的地下狂野派对
<21-12,ESPOSITO>an underground rave, fairy-tale themed.

733
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,540
<21-12,ESPOSITO>最后有人见到他是在10点45
<21-12,ESPOSITO>He was last seen alive at 10:45.

734
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,170
<21-13,CASTLE>但这张照片摄于11点23
<21-13,CASTLE>But this picture was taken at 11:23.

735
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,650
<21-14,BECKETT>他怎么死的
<21-14,BECKETT>How did he die?

736
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,600
<21-15,ESPOSITO>内出血加上体内大量的
<21-15,ESPOSITO>Ternal bleeding complicated with high doses

737
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,390
<21-15,ESPOSITO>氯胺酮和氧可酮
<21-15,ESPOSITO>of ketamine and oxycodone.

738
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,660
<21-16,BECKETT>这解释了犯人采取的作案手法
<21-16,BECKETT>That explains our killer's M.O..

739
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,160
<21-17,CASTLE>他当时磕多了俱乐部滥用药
<21-17,CASTLE>Okay, so he's high on club drugs,

741
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,950
<21-17,CASTLE>可什么导致了他的内出血呢
<21-17,CASTLE>but what caused the internal bleeding?

742
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,970
<21-18,ESPOSITO>车祸
<21-18,ESPOSITO>A car.

743
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,600
<21-18,ESPOSITO>他的尸体是在路边被发现的
<21-18,ESPOSITO>His body was found on the side of the road.

744
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,370
<21-18,ESPOSITO>法医鉴定是车祸逃逸
<21-18,ESPOSITO>M.E. wrote it up as a hit and run.

745
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,490
<21-18,ESPOSITO>没有目击证人
<21-18,ESPOSITO>There were no witnesses,

746
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,990
<21-18,ESPOSITO>因此没有线索可查  此案也就被搁置了
<21-18,ESPOSITO>So the trail went cold, they never solved the case.

747
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,490
<21-19,CASTLE>这不是《我知道你们去年夏天干了什么》的情节吗
<21-19,CASTLE>It's "I Know What You Did Last Summer."

748
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,580
<21-19,CASTLE>谁是最愧疚的人
<21-19,CASTLE>"Who's the guiltiest of them all?"

749
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,110
<21-19,CASTLE>犯人认为这三个女人中
<21-19,CASTLE>The killer thinks that one of these women

750
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,340
<21-19,CASTLE>有一个人要为他的死负责
<21-19,CASTLE>is responsible for his death.

751
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,210
<21-19,CASTLE>或许她们知道内情
<21-19,CASTLE>Maybe they are.

752
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,530
<21-20,ESPOSITO>这张照片证明她们是最后见到他活着的人
<21-20,ESPOSITO>This photo proves that they were the last ones to see him alive,

753
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,570
<21-20,ESPOSITO>但她们没有将此事告诉警方
<21-20,ESPOSITO>yet none of them gave statements to the cops.

754
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,400
<21-21,CASTLE>可犯人为什么直到七年后才动手
<21-21,CASTLE>But why are the murders happening now, seven years later?

755
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,780
<21-21,CASTLE>或许某人直到现在
<21-21,CASTLE>Well, maybe after all these years,

756
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,520
<21-22,BECKTT>才发现这张照片
<21-22,BECKTT>someone found this photo.

757
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,060
<21-22,BECKTT>埃斯波西托  你去查查欧文的家人和朋友
<21-22,BECKTT>Esposito, can you look into Owen's family and friends?

758
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,150
<21-22,BECKTT>也许这当中有人在为他报仇
<21-22,BECKTT>Someone might be trying to get payback for his death.

759
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,370
<21-23,ESPOSITO>没问题
<21-23,ESPOSITO>You got it.

761
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,780
<21-24,BECKETT>我们马上来
<21-24,BECKETT>Yeah. We'll be right there.

762
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,700
<21-24,BECKETT>睡美人醒了
<21-24,BECKETT>Sleeping beauty just woke up.

763
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,210
<21-24,BECKETT>夏洛特
<21-24,BECKETT>Charlotte?

764
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,870
<22-1,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  这位是卡塞尔先生
<22-1,BECKETT>I'm detective Beckett. This is Mr. Castle.

765
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,260
<22-1,BECKETT>你感觉好点没有  能回答几个问题吗
<22-1,BECKETT>Do you feel well enough to answer a few questions?

766
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,510
<22-2,CHARLOTTE>可以
<22-2,CHARLOTTE>Yeah.

767
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,380
<22-3,BECKETT>能不能跟我们说说你被攻击的情况
<22-3,BECKETT>What can you tell us about the attack?

768
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,410
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>我当时坐在电脑前
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>I was at my computer,

769
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,160
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>在听音乐
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>just listening to music,

770
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,360
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>接着
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>and... the next thing you know,

771
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,480
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>我被推倒在地
<22-4,CHARLOTTE>I'm being pushed to the floor.

772
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,030
<22-5,CASTLE>你看见行凶的人了吗
<22-5,CASTLE>Did you see who did it?

773
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,590
<22-5,CASTLE>没看到
<22-5,CASTLE>No.

774
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,990
<22-6,CHARLOTTE>医生说我被下药了
<22-6,CHARLOTTE>They're saying--they're saying I was drugged.

775
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,580
<22-6,CHARLOTTE>为什么会有人这样对我
<22-6,CHARLOTTE>Why would someone do this to me?

776
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,430
<22-7,BECKETT>夏洛特  我认为你知道原因
<22-7,BECKETT>Charlotte, I think you know why.

777
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,590
<22-7,BECKETT>你们三个人都收到了这张照片
<22-7,BECKETT>All three of you reived a copy of this photo.

778
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,870
<22-7,BECKETT>艾米和克里斯蒂娜没有你这么幸运
<22-7,BECKETT>Amy and Kristina weren't as lucky as you.

779
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,000
<22-7,BECKETT>她们都死了
<22-7,BECKETT>They didn't make it.

780
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,240
<22-8,CHARLOTTE>我的天啊
<22-8,CHARLOTTE>Oh, my God.

781
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:31,470
<22-8,CHARLOTTE>但我们已经照他说的做了  付了他钱
<22-8,CHARLOTTE>But we did what he asked. We paid him.

782
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,620
<22-9,CASTLE>你们有什么把柄在他手上
<22-9,CASTLE>What does he have on you?

783
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,180
<22-9,CASTLE>那天晚上欧文是怎么死的
<22-9,CASTLE>Wh happened to Owen that night?

784
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,620
<22-10,BECKETT>夏洛特
<22-10,BECKETT>Charlotte?

785
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,410
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>那只是一个童话主题的晚会
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>It was just some stupid... fairy-tale rave.

786
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,380
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>我们只想跳跳舞  开心一下
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>Um, we were just looking to dance and... have fun.

787
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,420
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>欧文搞到了点"K粉"
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>And Owen had scored some "Special K."

788
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,930
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>那个劲儿太大了
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>That hit is pretty hard,

789
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,270
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>但是克里斯蒂娜有她妈妈的氧可酮
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>but Kristina had some of her mom's oxy

790
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,510
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>可以均衡一下
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>and said it would even us out.

791
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,860
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>不知怎么  我们都进了艾米的车
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>Somehow we ended up in Amy's car,

792
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,990
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>就是拍这张图的地方
<22-11,CHARLOTTE>and that's where this picture was taken.

793
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,330
<22-12,BECKETT>欧文怎么会死在马路上
<22-12,BECKETT>How did Owen end up on the side of the road?

794
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,020
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>他出现了严重的幻觉
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>He was having some seriously bad hallucinations,

795
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,910
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>一直在尖叫  还抓我们
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>just... screaming and--and grabbing us.

796
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,980
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>所以我们把车停了下来  赶他下去了
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>So we pulled the car over, and we made him get out.

797
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,680
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>我们以为他回晚会现场了
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>We just figured, he'd walk back to the rave.

798
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,990
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>但是第二天早上新闻在铺天盖地的报道
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>But it was all over the news the next morning

799
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,730
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>那里有一起交通逃逸事故
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>that... that there had been a hit and run

800
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,930
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>死者是他
<22-13,CHARLOTTE>and that he'd been killed.

801
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,180
<22-14,BECKETT>你们为什么不自首
<22-14,BECKETT>And why didn't you come forward?

802
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,720
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我们当时还是孩子
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>Oh, we were just kids then.

803
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,130
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我们都吓傻了
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>We were scared out of our minds. You--

804
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,210
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>你们要理解  自首我们会付出很大代价
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>You have to understand, we had a lot to lose.

805
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,160
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我们家境优越  已经被大学录取
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>We came from good families, we'd been accepted into college,

806
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,860
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我们做了个约定
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>we... we made a pact. And we said,

807
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,020
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>约定不会把那晚的事情告诉任何人
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>we-- we wouldn't tell anyone what happened that night...

808
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,140
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>以后再不往来
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>and that we'd never see each other again.

809
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,820
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我不是在为我们找借口
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>Look, I'm not excusing how we handled it.

810
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,910
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>我们是很蠢
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>We were... stupid,

811
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,290
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>但是我们什么都没做
<22-15,CHARLOTTE>but... we didn't do anything.

812
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
<22-16,CASTLE>有人不这么认为
<22-16,CASTLE>Well, someone thinks you did.

813
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,720
<22-17,BECKETT>你们怎么把钱交给他的
<22-17,BECKETT>What did you do with the money?

814
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,870
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>信上说把钱放进巴勒克街和汤普森街交界处的
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>The note said to put it in a dumpster

815
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,910
<23-1,BECKETT>垃圾桶里
<23-1,BECKETT>at Bleecker and Thompson.

816
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,140
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>我们不希望有丑闻打搅我们的生活
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>We didn't want some scandal messing up our lives,

817
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,630
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>所以我们就照做了
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>So we did it.

818
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,230
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>我们把钱给他了
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>We paid.

819
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,960
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>为什么他还不放过我们
<22-18,CHARLOTTE>So why did he come after us?

820
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,060
<23-1,BECKETT>巴勒克街和汤普森街的交界处
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay, the corner of Bleecker and Thompson--

821
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,380
<23-1,BECKETT>放钱的地方没有监控器
<23-1,BECKETT>there are no security cameras at the drop site,

822
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,770
<23-1,BECKETT>目前为止  也没有证人
<23-1,BECKETT>and so far, no witnesses.

823
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,850
<23-2,CASTLE>他面面俱到
<23-2,CASTLE>He covered his bases.

824
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,890
<23-3,BECKETT>我真的有点恼火了
<23-3,BECKETT>I know. It's really starting to piss me off.

825
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,310
<23-4,CASTLE>你生气的时候还挺可爱的
<23-4,CASTLE>Yeah, and you get cute when you get angry.

826
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,880
<23-4,CASTLE>但生我气就不可爱了
<23-4,CASTLE>But not when you get angry with me.

827
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,360
<23-5,ESPOSITO>我查了一下欧文家里的情况
<23-5,ESPOSITO>So I took a look Owen's family.

828
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,930
<23-5,ESPOSITO>发现一个有动机的人
<23-5,ESPOSITO>I think I found someone with motive.

829
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,980
<23-5,ESPOSITO>他有一个哥哥
<23-5,ESPOSITO>Turns out he has an older brother,

830
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,480
<23-5,ESPOSITO>很明显  他们关系很好
<23-5,ESPOSITO>and apparently, they were close.

831
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,900
<23-6,BECKETT>和死者有关系吗
<23-6,BECKETT>Any connection to our victims?

832
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,270
<23-7,ESPOSITO>有的很
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah

833
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,860
<23-7,ESPOSITO>自己看吧
<23-7,ESPOSITO>See for yourself.

834
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,060
<23-8,BECKETT>等等  他是莱斯利的老公达伦
<23-8,BECKETT>Wait. That's Leslie's husband Darren.

835
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,920
<23-9,CASTLE>欧文的哥哥娶了第一个被害人的妹妹
<23-9,CASTLE>So Owen's brother is married to our first victim's sister?

836
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,250
<23-10,ESPOSITO>是啊  这世界可真小
<23-10,ESPOSITO>What are the odds, right?

837
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,700
<23-11,CASTLE>也许达伦发现了他妻子的姐姐
<23-11,CASTLE>Maybe Darren somehow found out that his wife's sister

838
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,500
<23-11,CASTLE>与他弟弟的死有关
<23-11,CASTLE>was responsible for his brother Owen's death.

839
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,340
<23-12,BECKETT>或者是两家本来就是世交
<23-12,BECKETT>Well, maybe the families just knew each other socially.

840
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,680
<23-12,BECKETT>这不能说明达伦就是凶手
<23-12,BECKETT>It doesn't mean that Darren's our killer.

841
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,270
<23-13,RYAN>的确  但我要说的事能证明
<23-13,RYAN>Oh, that doesn't, but this might.

842
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,530
<23-13,RYAN>鉴证组找到了处理照片的地方
<23-13,RYAN>C.S.U. tracked down where the photo was processed.

843
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,470
<23-13,RYAN>这张是一卷胶卷里的
<23-13,RYAN>It's from a roll of film,

844
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,720
<23-13,RYAN>那个人洗了三张照片
<23-13,RYAN>and the guy who dropped it off had three copies made.

845
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,890
<23-14,BECKETT>店员描述的长相与达伦符合
<23-14,BECKETT>And does the guy's description match Darren's?

846
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,750
<23-15,RYAN>不需要描述  他们有监控
<23-15,RYAN>Even better. They had surity cameras.

847
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,940
<23-16,BECKETT>就是他
<23-16,BECKETT>It's him.

848
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,670
<24-1,LESLIE>我尽快赶来了
<24-1,LESLIE>I got here as fast as I could.

849
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,130
<24-1,LESLIE>有什么消息吗
<24-1,LESLIE>So is there any news?

850
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,970
<24-1,LESLIE>找到杀害我妹妹的人了吗
<24-1,LESLIE>Did you find out who did this to my sister?

851
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,040
<24-2,ESPOSITO>我先问个问题
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Uh, first let me ask,

852
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,460
<24-2,ESPOSITO>你妹妹和你小叔子的关系如何
<24-2,ESPOSITO>what was Amy's relationship with your husband's brother--

853
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,650
<24-4,LESLIE>我是指欧文
<24-4,LESLIE>Owen?

854
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,360
<24-3,LESLIE>他们是高中时期的好朋友
<24-3,LESLIE>They were high school friends.

855
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,880
<24-3,LESLIE>我们都是朋友
<24-3,LESLIE>We all were.

856
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,280
<24-3,LESLIE>这和艾米的案子有什么关系
<24-3,LESLIE>What does this have to do with Amy?

857
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,010
<24-4,LESLIE>欧文很久以前就去世了
<24-4,LESLIE>Owen died years ago.

858
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,040
<24-5,ESPOSITO>你见过这张照片吗
<24-5,ESPOSITO>You ever see this before?

859
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:55,920
<24-5,ESPOSITO>没见过
<24-5,ESPOSITO>No.

860
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,370
<24-6,LESLIE>这是艾米
<24-6,LESLIE>That's Amy,

861
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,080
<24-6,LESLIE>这是欧文
<24-6,LESLIE>and that's Owen.

862
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,890
<24-6,LESLIE>这两个女孩我不认识
<24-6,LESLIE>These two I don't know.

863
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:08,020
<24-7,RYAN>-这是他出车祸那晚照的照片  -这样啊
<24-7,RYAN>- It's from the night that he was killed. - Okay.

864
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,970
<24-8,LESLIE>你丈夫达伦两周之前把它洗了出来
<24-8,LESLIE>Your husband Darren had it printed up two weeks ago.

865
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,090
<24-9,RYAN>你知道他怎么得到这张照片的吗
<24-9,RYAN>Do you have any idea how he got it?

866
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,770
<24-10,LESLIE>上个月
<24-10,LESLIE>Last month,

867
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,600
<24-10,LESLIE>我们在整理我爸爸的阁楼
<24-10,LESLIE>we were cleaning out my dad's attic.

868
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,340
<24-10,LESLIE>找到了一个相机  里面有卷胶卷
<24-10,LESLIE>And found a camera with a roll of film inside.

869
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,220
<24-10,LESLIE>达伦很想看看胶卷上的照片  觉得有趣
<24-10,LESLIE>Darren thought it would be fun to see what was on it.

870
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:30,350
<24-11,LESLIE>你们不是觉得他和艾米的死有关吧
<24-11,LESLIE>You--you don't think he had anything to do with Amy...

871
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,260
<24-11,LESLIE>是这样吗
<24-11,LESLIE>Do you?

872
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,660
<25-1,DARREN>我不知道你们在说什么
<25-1,DARREN>I don't know what you guys are talking about.

873
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,290
<25-1,DARREN>我没有敲诈任何人
<25-1,DARREN>I didn't blackmail anybody.

874
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,580
<25-2,BECKETT>那你不认识这张照片咯
<25-2,BECKETT>All right, so then you don't recognize this photo?

875
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,090
<25-3,DARREN>绝对不认识
<25-3,DARREN>Absolutely not.

876
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:47,210
<25-4,BECKETT>这个人也不是你  对吧  达伦
<25-4,BECKETT>And then... this isn't you, is it, Darren?

877
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,680
<25-5,CASTLE>我能想象你的感觉
<25-5,CASTLE>I can only imagine how you must have felt.

878
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,560
<25-5,CASTLE>这么多年了  竟然发现自己的小姨子
<25-5,CASTLE>After all these years, realizing your own sister-in-law

879
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,450
<25-5,CASTLE>也许和弟弟的死有关
<25-5,CASTLE>might be involved in your brother's death.

880
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,150
<25-6,BECKETT>我们在皇后区你的储藏柜里找到了现金
<25-6,BECKETT>We found the cash in your storage locker in Queens--

881
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,710
<25-6,BECKETT>151815刀
<25-6,BECKETT>$151,815.

882
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,260
<25-7,CASTLE>诡异地恰好是50605的三倍
<25-7,CASTLE>Which, by wild coincidence, is exactly $50,605 times 3.

883
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,920
<25-8,DARREN>欧文吸嗨了
<25-8,DARREN>Owen was high.

884
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,110
<25-8,DARREN>他神志不清
<25-8,DARREN>He was messed up.

885
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,570
<25-8,DARREN>她们明明知道  她们做了什么
<25-8,DARREN>They knew that, and what did they do?

886
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,110
<25-8,DARREN>她们把他扔在那儿
<25-8,DARREN>They left him there.

887
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,260
<25-8,DARREN>她们丢下他  任由他像动物一样被撞死
<25-8,DARREN>They left him and he died like road kill.

888
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,660
<25-9,BECKETT>你本可以去报警的
<25-9,BECKETT>You could've gone to the police.

889
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,950
<25-10,DARREN>报警干嘛  他们第一次调查得那么"出色"
<25-10,DARREN>Because they did such a bang-up job the first time around?

890
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,450
<25-10,DARREN>我只想让她们
<25-10,DARREN>I just wanted them to pay something

891
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,830
<25-10,DARREN>为她们的所作所为付出代价
<25-10,DARREN>for what they did.

892
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,330
<25-10,DARREN>我甚至想要用这笔钱
<25-10,DARREN>I was even gonna use the money

893
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,400
<25-10,DARREN>以欧文的名义建立一个奖学金基金会
<25-10,DARREN>to set up a scholarship fund in Owen's name.

894
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,020
<25-11,BECKETT>真的吗  奖学金基金会
<25-11,BECKETT>Really, a scholarship fund?

895
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,030
<25-11,BECKETT>那谋杀你要建立个什么
<25-11,BECKETT>And what's your spin on murder?

896
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,400
<25-11,BECKETT>有了钱还不够
<25-11,BECKETT>The money wasn't enough.

897
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,190
<25-12,CASTLE>你想复仇
<25-12,CASTLE>You wanted revenge.

898
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,670
<25-12,CASTLE>你想让她们像你弟弟一样死去
<25-12,CASTLE>You wanted them to die like your brother,

899
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,330
<25-12,CASTLE>穿着童话的服装
<25-12,CASTLE>dressed in fairy-tale costumes,

900
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,970
<25-12,CASTLE>过量摄入他服用的毒品
<25-12,CASTLE>O.D.'ing on the some drug he did.

901
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,410
<25-13,DARREN>什么  我没有
<25-13,DARREN>What? No.

902
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,050
<25-13,DARREN>我不知道谁杀了她们  但是不是我
<25-13,DARREN>I don't know who killed them, but it wasn't me.

903
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,670
<25-14,BECKETT>很难让人相信  达伦
<25-14,BECKETT>That's gonna be tough to believe, Darren.

904
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,450
<25-14,BECKETT>你有动机  你因为欧文的死怪罪她们
<25-14,BECKETT>You had motive, you blamed them for Owen's death,

905
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,280
<25-14,BECKETT>而且你还承认你勒索了她们
<25-14,BECKETT>and you just admitted to blackmailing them.

906
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,340
<25-15,DARREN>我要求请律师
<25-15,DARREN>I want a lawyer.

907
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,460
<25-16,BECKETT>你当然要
<25-16,BECKETT>Of course you do.

908
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,720
<26-1,BECKETT>达伦不需要律师
<26-1,BECKETT>Darren doesn't need a lawyer.

909
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,830
<26-1,BECKETT>他需要奇迹
<26-1,BECKETT>He needs a miracle.

910
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,260
<26-1,BECKETT>他妻子跟莱恩说
<26-1,BECKETT>His wife told Ryan that

911
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,180
<26-1,BECKETT>事发时他并不在家
<26-1,BECKETT>he wasn't at the house when the murders were committed.

912
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,710
<26-2,CASTLE>结案了
<26-2,CASTLE>So that's it then.

913
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,870
<26-3,BECKETT>是啊  这件案子结了
<26-3,BECKETT>Yeah, for this case.

914
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,460
<26-3,BECKETT>我们为地检官准备得够充分了  就差系蝴蝶结了
<26-3,BECKETT>We did everything but tie a bow on it for the D.A.

915
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,400
<26-4,RYAN>这边请  摩根女士
<26-4,RYAN>Right this way, Ms. Morgan.

916
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,460
<26-5,LESLIE>是真的吗  达伦
<26-5,LESLIE>Is it true, Darren?

917
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,950
<26-5,LESLIE>是真的吗
<26-5,LESLIE>Is it true?

918
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,230
<26-5,LESLIE>看着我说这不是真的
<26-5,LESLIE>Look me in the eyes and tell me it's not true!

919
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,070
<26-6,DARREN>不  宝贝  我没有伤害任何人
<26-6,DARREN>No, babe. I didn't hurt anyone.

920
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,940
<26-7,LESLIE>你勒索我的妹妹
<26-7,LESLIE>You blackmailed my sister!

921
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,910
<26-7,LESLIE>你骗我
<26-7,LESLIE>You lied to me.

922
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,870
<26-8,DARREN>听着
<26-8,DARREN>You-- no, l-listen.

923
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,190
<26-8,DARREN>我说的是真话  我没有杀害任何人
<26-8,DARREN>I'm telling you the truth, okay? I didn't kill anyone.

924
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,180
<26-8,DARREN>我只想让她们给钱
<26-8,DARREN>I just wanted them to pay.

925
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,230
<26-9,LESLIE>那是谁干的  你有照片
<26-9,LESLIE>Who would do it then? You had the picture.

926
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,030
<26-10,DARREN>不  宝贝  我保证
<26-10,DARREN>No, no! Babe, I swear--

927
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,830
<28-31,BECKETT>我的天  就是你
<28-31,BECKETT>Oh, my God. It was you!

928
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,500
<26-10,DARREN>我发誓  我发誓
<26-10,DARREN>I swear. I swear. Babe--

929
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,640
<26-11,LESLIE>你离我远一点
<26-11,LESLIE>You know what? You need to get away from me...

930
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,340
<26-11,LESLIE>远点
<26-11,LESLIE>Right now!

931
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,810
<26-12,DARREN>听我说  小莱
<26-12,DARREN>Listen. Les--

932
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,710
<26-13,LESLIE>你离我远一点
<26-13,LESLIE>You've just gotta stay...away.

933
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,150
<26-14,CASTLE>谋杀让活着的人更痛苦
<26-14,CASTLE>Murder does more damage to the living than to the dead.

934
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,890
<26-15,BECKETT>全都因为一个可怕的秘密
<26-15,BECKETT>Yeah, all because of a terrible secret.

935
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,340
<26-16,CASTLE>秘密就像是定时炸弹
<26-16,CASTLE>Well, secrets are like time bombs.

936
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,210
<26-17,BECKETT>终究还会爆炸
<26-17,BECKETT>Yeah, eventually, they... explode.

937
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,650
<26-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不是原谅达伦所作的一切
<26-18,BECKETT>You know, Castle, i'm not saying that I condone what Darren did,

938
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,650
<26-18,BECKETT>但是我理解他
<26-18,BECKETT>but I do understand it.

939
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:26,020
<26-19,CASTLE>我懂想要复仇的滋味
<26-19,CASTLE>Yeah. No, I understand wanting revenge.

940
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,770
<26-19,CASTLE>但是他采用的方式好奇怪
<26-19,CASTLE>The way he went about it doesn't add up, though.

941
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,880
<26-20,BECKETT>什么意思
<26-20,BECKETT>What do you mean?

942
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,520
<26-21,CASTLE>勒索是远距离复仇
<26-21,CASTLE>Well, blackmail is revenge from a distance.

943
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,790
<26-21,CASTLE>谋杀却是近距离的  私怨的
<26-21,CASTLE>Murder is up close and personal.

944
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,960
<26-21,CASTLE>两样都做  没道理啊
<26-21,CASTLE>It doesn't make sense he would do both.

945
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,070
<26-22,BECKETT>别低估了他
<26-22,BECKETT>Don't underestimate him.

946
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,980
<26-22,BECKETT>他承认勒索的唯一目的
<26-22,BECKETT>I mean, the only reason that he copped to blackmail

947
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,040
<26-22,BECKETT>是想逃避谋杀指控
<26-22,BECKETT>was to avoid murder charges.

948
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,330
<26-22,BECKETT>和其他变态狂一样
<26-22,BECKETT>And like any psychopath,

949
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,300
<26-22,BECKETT>他是个好演员
<26-22,BECKETT>he's a great actor.

950
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,550
<26-23,CASTLE>-说到...  -说到变态狂还是说到演员
<26-23,CASTLE>- Oh, speaking of... - Psychopaths or actors?

951
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,660
<26-24,BECKETT>我想到了你妈妈
<26-24,BECKETT>I-I was thinking about your mom.

952
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,760
<26-25,CASTLE>原来你是指提到这两个词
<26-25,CASTLE>Oh, so a little of both.

953
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,450
<26-26,BECKETT>我们应该赶得上你老妈的演出
<26-26,BECKETT>I think we can make the play.

954
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:50,630
<26-26,BECKETT>当真要去
<26-26,BECKETT>Really?

955
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,480
<26-27,CASTLE>你想在黑暗恐怖的树林中冒险吗
<26-27,CASTLE>So you want to venture into the dark, scary woods?

956
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,310
<26-28,BECKETT>别害怕  卡塞尔  我可是带枪的
<26-28,BECKETT>Don't worry, Castle. I got a gun.

957
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,910
<26-28,BECKETT>我会保护你不被大灰狼吃掉的
<26-28,BECKETT>I'll protect you from the big bad wolf.

958
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:58,930
<26-29,CASTLE>你会为了我对我老妈痛下杀手
<26-29,CASTLE>You'd use your gun on my mother?

959
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,840
<26-29,CASTLE>我好感动
<26-29,CASTLE>I'm touched.

960
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,280
<27-1,CASTLE>多谢
<27-1,CASTLE>Thank you.

961
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,840
<27-1,CASTLE>谢谢
<27-1,CASTLE>Ah, thank you.

962
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,820
<27-2,BECKETT>天啊  卡塞尔  这称得上是个社交聚会了
<27-2,BECKETT>Oh, wow, Castle. This is quite the soiree.

963
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,440
<27-3,CASTLE>这是家族特点
<27-3,CASTLE>Yeah, it's a family trait.

964
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,180
<27-3,CASTLE>都爱把规模搞大  干杯
<27-3,CASTLE>We tend to go big. Cheers.

965
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,560
<27-4,CASTLE>干杯
<27-4,CASTLE>Cheers.

966
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,480
<27-6,CASTLE>-失陪一下  -好的
<27-6,CASTLE>- Would you excuse me a moment?   - Yeah.

967
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,690
<27-8,CASTLE>你来了
<27-8,CASTLE>Hey. You came.

968
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,010
<27-10,MARTHA>这对我来说意义重大  亲爱的
<27-10,MARTHA>Oh, it means so much to me, darling.

969
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,160
<27-11,ALEXIS>她担心你不会来
<27-11,ALEXIS>She was worried you wouldn't make it.

970
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,210
<27-12,CASTLE>老妈  祝你演出成功
<27-12,CASTLE>Break a leg, mother.

971
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,720
<27-13,ALEXIS>抓紧时间  两分钟后开幕
<27-13,ALEXIS>We have a schedule to keep. Curtain in two minutes.

972
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,680
<27-14,MARTHA>这个蝴蝶结总是打不对
<27-14,MARTHA>I can't get this bow straight.

973
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
<27-15,CASTLE>我来帮你吧
<27-15,CASTLE>Allow me. Allow me.

974
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,720
<27-16,MARTHA>我应该让阿丽克西斯帮我打结的
<27-16,MARTHA>Oh, maybe I should have Alexis do it.

975
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,690
<27-16,MARTHA>你这辈子都没打过几个蝴蝶结
<27-16,MARTHA>I mean, how many bows have you tied in your lifetime?

976
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,510
<27-17,CASTLE>但我每天系鞋带啊
<27-17,CASTLE>Well, I tie my shoes every day.

977
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,560
<27-17,CASTLE>还是你教我的  记得吗
<27-17,CASTLE>If you remember, you taught me.

978
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,850
<27-18,MARTHA>是啊  没错
<27-18,MARTHA>Yeah, yeah, true.

979
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,250
<27-19,CASTLE>蝴蝶结
<27-19,CASTLE>The bow.

980
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,010
<27-19,CASTLE>蝴蝶结系得不对
<27-19,CASTLE>The bow was tied incorrectly.

981
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:54,350
<27-20,MARTHA>我早说过应该让阿丽克西斯帮我系的
<27-20,MARTHA>Well, I told you, we should've had Alexis do it.

982
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,490
<27-21,CASTLE>不是说这个结  是另一个  她服装上的那个
<27-21,CASTLE>Not you bow. The other bow. The one on her costume.

983
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,480
<27-21,CASTLE>我们抓错人了
<27-21,CASTLE>We arrested the wrong man.

984
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,670
<28-1,CHARLOTTE>什么  我不懂
<28-1,CHARLOTTE>What? I-I don't understand.

985
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,570
<28-1,CHARLOTTE>你是说达伦不是凶手吗
<28-1,CHARLOTTE>So you're saying Darren didn't do it?

986
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,830
<28-2,CASTLE>他敲诈勒索是真的
<28-2,CASTLE>Well, he's guilty of blackmail,

987
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,160
<28-2,CASTLE>但他没有杀人
<28-2,CASTLE>but that's as far as it goes.

988
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,340
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>那如果凶手依然逍遥法外
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>So what if the killer's still out there?

989
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,530
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>他来杀我怎么办
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>What if he comes after me

990
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,920
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>不会的
<28-3,CHARLOTTE>He won't.

991
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,000
<28-4,BECKETT>我们的警员全天候守候
<28-4,BECKETT>We have officers outside 24/7.

992
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,110
<28-4,BECKETT>我们会抓到凶手的  夏洛特
<28-4,BECKETT>We'll find him, Charlotte.

993
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,460
<28-4,BECKETT>我们只是
<28-4,BECKETT>We just, um,

994
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,830
<28-4,BECKETT>我们想要你帮点忙
<28-4,BECKETT>we need a bit of your help.

995
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,370
<28-5,CHARLOTTE>当然  我尽我所能
<28-5,CHARLOTTE>Of course. Whatever I can do.

996
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,950
<28-6,BECKETT>我们认为抓到真凶的关键
<28-6,BECKETT>Well, we think that the key to finding the real kill

997
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,510
<28-6,BECKETT>是要弄清欧文被撞死的那天晚上
<28-6,BECKETT>is through understanding exactly what happened

998
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,730
<28-6,BECKETT>到底发生了什么
<28-6,BECKETT>the night of Owen's death.

999
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,190
<28-6,BECKETT>你能回答几个问题吗
<28-6,BECKETT>Can you answer a few questions?

1000
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,430
<28-7,CHARLOTTE>好吧  尽量吧
<28-7,CHARLOTTE>Y-yeah. I mean, I guess so,

1001
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,800
<28-7,CHARLOTTE>但我把知道的都告诉你们了
<28-7,CHARLOTTE>though I'm pretty sure I told you everything I know.

1002
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,540
<28-8,BECKETT>上次我们谈话时  你说所有人
<28-8,BECKETT>Well, last time we spoke, you said that everyone

1003
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,740
<28-8,BECKETT>都在艾米的车上
<28-8,BECKETT>was in Amy's car?

1004
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,720
<28-9,CHARLOTTE>是的
<28-9,CHARLOTTE>Right.

1005
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,190
<28-10,BECKETT>开车的是谁
<28-10,BECKETT>And who was driving?

1006
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,520
<28-11,CHARLOTTE>艾米  怎么
<28-11,CHARLOTTE>She was. Why?

1007
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,240
<28-12,CASTLE>我们调查了一下
<28-12,CASTLE>Well, we did a little checking.

1008
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,150
<28-12,CASTLE>欧文去世次日
<28-12,CASTLE>The day after Owen died,

1009
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,700
<28-12,CASTLE>艾米把她的车带到汽车修理店
<28-12,CASTLE>Amy brought her car to a body shop.

1010
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,710
<28-12,CASTLE>车子的护栅和保险杠都坏了
<28-12,CASTLE>She had a broken grille and a dented bumper.

1011
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,080
<28-13,BECKETT>知道是怎么损坏的吗
<28-13,BECKETT>Any idea how she got those dents?

1012
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
<28-14,CASTLE>夏洛特  那天晚上到底发生了什么
<28-14,CASTLE>Charlotte, what really happened that night?

1013
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,410
<28-14,CASTLE>欧文有没有试图回到车上
<28-14,CASTLE>Did Owen try to get back into the car?

1014
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,130
<28-14,CASTLE>可能艾米慌张了
<28-14,CASTLE>Maybe Amy panicked,

1015
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,750
<28-14,CASTLE>离开时不小心撞到他了
<28-14,CASTLE>Accidentally hitting him as she drove away?

1016
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,620
<28-15,BECKETT>夏洛特
<28-15,BECKETT>Charlotte?

1017
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:13,070
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>我祈求艾米掉头的
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>I begged Amy to go back.

1018
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,110
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>克里斯蒂娜和我都劝的
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>Kristina and I both did.

1019
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,540
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>我们求她掉头  但她仍然径直开
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>We begged her, but she just kept driving.

1020
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,660
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>她不是有意要撞他的
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>She didn't mean to hurt him.

1021
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,050
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>是场意外
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>It was just an accident.

1022
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,420
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>这就是真相
<28-16,CHARLOTTE>That's the truth. That's what really happened.

1023
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,850
<28-17,CASTLE>真的吗
<28-17,CASTLE>Is it?

1024
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,910
<28-18,CASTLE>看看这些蝴蝶结
<28-18,CASTLE>Take a look at how the bows

1025
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,460
<28-18,CASTLE>都是怎样系在被害人的服装上的
<28-18,CASTLE>are tied on the victims' costumes.

1026
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,960
<28-19,CHARLOTTE>怎么了
<28-19,CHARLOTTE>What about them?

1027
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,570
<28-20,CASTLE>这些蝴蝶结是凶手系的
<28-20,CASTLE>Well, the killer tied these bows

1028
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,740
<28-20,CASTLE>在被害人被下药之后
<28-20,CASTLE>after the victims were drugged.

1029
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,300
<28-20,CASTLE>注意蝴蝶结的样式
<28-20,CASTLE>See how they look,

1030
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,610
<28-20,CASTLE>都是完美的水平
<28-20,CASTLE>How the loops are pleasingly horizontal?

1031
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,750
<28-20,CASTLE>再来看看系在你睡美人服装上的蝴蝶结
<28-20,CASTLE>Now... look at the bow on your sleeping beauty outfit.

1032
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,210
<28-20,CASTLE>蝴蝶结却是竖直的
<28-20,CASTLE>See how the loops are vertical?

1033
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,110
<28-20,CASTLE>有点奇怪
<28-20,CASTLE>It's a little weird.

1034
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,230
<28-20,CASTLE>如果三个蝴蝶结都是凶手系的
<28-20,CASTLE>I mean, if the killer tied all three bows,

1035
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,350
<28-20,CASTLE>为什么偏偏你的与别人的不同
<28-20,CASTLE>Why would yours be different?

1036
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,310
<28-21,BECKETT>因为这三个蝴蝶结都是你系的
<28-21,BECKETT>It's because you tied all three bows.

1037
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,580
<28-21,BECKETT>这个不同是因为这是你给自己系的
<28-21,BECKETT>This one is different because you tied it on yourself

1038
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,790
<28-21,BECKETT>系到身后
<28-21,BECKETT>behind your back.

1039
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,990
<28-22,CHARLOTTE>不  我被攻击了
<28-22,CHARLOTTE>No. I was attacked.

1040
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,560
<28-22,CHARLOTTE>我是被害人
<28-22,CHARLOTTE>I am a victim.

1041
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,360
<28-23,CASTLE>但医生说你只摄入了
<28-23,CASTLE>Yet, your doctor said you received

1042
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,800
<28-23,CASTLE>相当于其他女孩体内一半剂量的氧可酮
<28-23,CASTLE>half the dose of oxy that the other girls got,

1043
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,020
<28-23,CASTLE>不致死的剂量
<28-23,CASTLE>A nonlethal dose.

1044
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,330
<28-24,BECKETT>当我们把车停到你家门外
<28-24,BECKETT>How soon after we pulled up

1045
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,760
<28-24,BECKETT>你过了多久想出给自己注射毒品的
<28-24,BECKETT>outside of your building did you give yourself that shot?

1046
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,010
<28-25,CHARLOTTE>这太疯狂了
<28-25,CHARLOTTE>This is crazy.

1047
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,070
<28-25,CHARLOTTE>我为什么要制造自己被袭击的假象
<28-25,CHARLOTTE>Why would I fake an attack on myself?

1048
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,120
<28-26,CASTLE>这样就没人会怀疑
<28-26,CASTLE>So no one would suspect you

1049
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,090
<28-26,CASTLE>你杀害了目睹你罪行仅有的两个目击证人
<28-26,CASTLE>of silencing the only two witnesses to your crime.

1050
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,980
<28-27,CHARLOTTE>你们在说什么啊
<28-27,CHARLOTTE>What are you talking about?

1051
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,400
<28-28,CASTLE>当时克里斯蒂娜和艾米
<28-28,CASTLE>At the time, Kristina and Amy

1052
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,450
<28-28,CASTLE>都同意帮你保守秘密
<28-28,CASTLE>were willing to bury your secret,

1053
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,010
<28-28,CASTLE>但后来
<28-28,CASTLE>But then...

1054
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,310
<28-28,CASTLE>这张照片出现了
<28-28,CASTLE>This photo showed up.

1055
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,560
<28-29,BECKETT>你还能再指望她们保守多久呢
<28-29,BECKETT>I mean, how long could you expect them to keep the secret,

1056
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,610
<28-29,BECKETT>尤其是犯案的人是你
<28-29,BECKETT>Especially since you were at fault?

1057
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,850
<28-30,CASTLE>你所想的只有这桩丑事
<28-30,CASTLE>All you could think about was the scandal--

1058
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:49,810
<28-30,CASTLE>监狱会毁了你的人生
<28-30,CASTLE>Jail, how it would ruin your life--

1059
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,090
<28-30,CASTLE>都是因为克里斯蒂娜和艾米知道真相
<28-30,CASTLE>All because Kristina and Amy knew the truth.

1060
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,650
<28-30,CASTLE>夏洛特
<28-30,CASTLE>Charlotte,

1061
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,160
<28-31,BECKETT>当天艾米的车是你驾驶的
<28-31,BECKETT>you were behind the wheel in Amy's car.

1062
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,570
<28-31,BECKETT>是你开车撞了欧文  导致他的死亡
<28-31,BECKETT>It was you that hit and killed Owen.

1063
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,000
<28-32,CHARLOTTE>不  我说了  车是艾米开的
<28-32,CHARLOTTE>No, Amy was driving. I told you.

1064
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,210
<28-33,BECKETT>那为什么汽车修理费是你支付的
<28-33,BECKETT>Then why did you pay for the car repairs?

1065
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,360
<28-34,BECKETT>我们有收据
<28-34,BECKETT>We have the receipt.

1066
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,730
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>你们不知道那天晚上发生了什么
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>You don't know what happened that night.

1067
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,630
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>你们证明不了我撞了欧文
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>You can't prove that I hit Owen,

1068
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,070
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>你们也证明不了我杀了艾米和克里斯蒂娜
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>and you can't prove that I killed Amy or Kristina.

1069
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,600
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>我能
<28-35,CHARLOTTE>Yes, I can.

1070
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,160
<28-36,BECKETT>你的事务所处理了一位年迈女士
<28-36,BECKETT>Your firm handled the reverse mortgage

1071
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,260
<28-36,BECKETT>杰米·伊萨克森的反向抵押贷款业务
<28-36,BECKETT>of an old woman named Jamie Isaacson.

1072
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,220
<28-36,BECKETT>她用信用卡支付了服装费
<28-36,BECKETT>She paid closing costs with her credit card.

1073
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,070
<28-36,BECKETT>而那就是你用来
<28-36,BECKETT>That's the same credit card

1074
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,410
<28-36,BECKETT>支付那三套服装的信用卡
<28-36,BECKETT>that you used to pay for all three costumes.

1075
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,670
<28-37,BECKETT>夏洛特·博伊德你因谋杀
<28-37,BECKETT>Charlotte Boyd, you are under arrest

1076
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,810
<28-37,BECKETT>艾米·摩根
<28-37,BECKETT>for the murders of Amy Morgan...

1077
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,940
<28-37,BECKETT>克里斯蒂娜·柯蒂斯
<28-37,BECKETT>Kristina Curtis,

<28-37,BECKETT>和过失杀死欧文·托马斯被捕
<28-37,BECKETT>and the wrongful death of Owen Thomas.

1079
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,850
<28-38,CHARLOTTE>蝴蝶结
<28-38,CHARLOTTE>The bows?

1080
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,880
<28-38,CHARLOTTE>就这么露陷了
<28-38,CHARLOTTE>Seriously?

1081
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,160
<29-1,CASTLE>她其实是完美的童话坏蛋
<29-1,CASTLE>She's actually the perfect fairy-tale villain.

1082
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,100
<29-1,CASTLE>好比大灰狼
<29-1,CASTLE>Like the big bad wolf,

1083
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,490
<29-1,CASTLE>把自己伪装成无辜的人
<29-1,CASTLE>she disguised herself as an innocent,

1084
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,900
<29-1,CASTLE>又好比白雪公主里的邪恶继母
<29-1,CASTLE>but like snow white's evil stepmother,

1085
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,650
<29-1,CASTLE>她不择手段  甚至杀戮
<29-1,CASTLE>she was willing to do anything, even kill,

1086
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,910
<29-1,CASTLE>只为了保护自己形象
<29-1,CASTLE>to protect her image.

1087
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,070
<29-2,RYAN>这么多年过去了
<29-2,RYAN>After all these years,

1088
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,310
<29-2,RYAN>也许欧文的家人终于可以释怀了
<29-2,RYAN>maybe Owen's family can have some closure about his death.

1089
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,360
<29-3,ESPOSITO>但是代价呢
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but at what cost?

1090
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,430
<29-3,ESPOSITO>两个女人死了
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Two women are dead,

1091
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,160
<29-3,ESPOSITO>达伦依然被指控敲诈勒索
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Darren's still being charged with blackmail,

1092
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,380
<29-3,ESPOSITO>我确定他妻子肯定跟他离婚
<29-3,ESPOSITO>and I'm sure his marriage is over.

1093
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,410
<29-3,ESPOSITO>这就是我们需要童话的原因
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Well, and that's why we need fairy tales

1094
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,070
<29-4,BECKETT>面对太多残酷的现实
<29-4,BECKETT>in the face of too much reality,

1095
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,270
<29-4,BECKETT>童话提醒我们美好的结局依然可能
<29-4,BECKETT>to remind us that happy endings are still possible.

1096
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,590
<29-5,RYAN>好的  明早见
<29-5,RYAN>All right. See you in the morning.

1097
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,230
<29-5,RYAN>-再见  -再见
<29-5,RYAN>- Later.  - Bye.

1098
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,530
<29-6,CASTLE>说到童话故事
<29-6,CASTLE>Speaking of fairy tales,

1099
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,470
<29-6,CASTLE>我老妈要安可演出了
<29-6,CASTLE>my mother is ready to give her encore performance.

1100
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,750
<29-7,BECKETT>该回到黑暗丛林了吗
<29-7,BECKETT>Time to go back into the woods?

1101
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,530
<29-8,CASTLE>还带着枪吗
<29-8,CASTLE>Still got your gun?

1102
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,010
<30-1,MARTHA>这是一生一次的好机会
<30-1,MARTHA>It was the opportunity of a lifetime--

1103
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,490
<30-1,MARTHA>有机会在百老汇塑造
<30-1,MARTHA>the chance to originate the role

1104
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,790
<30-1,MARTHA>一个邪恶的巫婆的角色
<30-1,MARTHA>of the wicked witch on Broadway.

1105
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,200
<30-1,MARTHA>但这也意味着要离开家
<30-1,MARTHA>But it would mean being away from home

1106
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,130
<30-1,MARTHA>一周演六个晚场  两个日场
<30-1,MARTHA>Six nights a week, two matinees.

1107
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,500
<30-1,MARTHA>我该怎么做呢
<30-1,MARTHA>Huh. What was I to do?

1108
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,420
<30-2,CASTLE>要知道这全是虚构的
<30-2,CASTLE>Realize that none of it ever happened?

1109
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,380
<30-3,MARTHA>弗朗西斯·培根曾写道
<30-3,MARTHA>Francis Bacon once wrote,

1110
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,710
<30-3,MARTHA>有子女之人
<30-3,MARTHA>"He that hath children

1111
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,110
<30-3,MARTHA>已将自己押给了命运
<30-3,MARTHA>hath given hostages to fortune."

1112
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,440
<30-3,MARTHA>如果我是人质  那么我的儿子理查德
<30-3,MARTHA>Well, if I was a hostage, then my son Richard

1113
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,160
<30-3,MARTHA>就是我的绑架者
<30-3,MARTHA>was my captor,

1114
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,090
<30-3,MARTHA>我的奴役者
<30-3,MARTHA>my enslaver.

1115
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,420
<30-4,CASTLE>我人可就在这呢
<30-4,CASTLE>Hey, I'm right here.

1116
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,110
<30-5,MARTHA>我没有接演那个角色  我拒绝了财富
<30-5,MARTHA>I turned down the role, turned my back on fortune.

1117
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,190
<30-5,MARTHA>这
<30-5,MARTHA>And...

1118
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,470
<30-5,MARTHA>是我职业生涯最棒的一次抉择
<30-5,MARTHA>it was the best career move I ever made,

1119
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,860
<30-5,MARTHA>因为一个更伟大的角色出现在我面前
<30-5,MARTHA>for an even greater role came my way...

1120
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,350
<30-5,MARTHA>这个角色
<30-5,MARTHA>A part--

1121
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,760
<30-5,MARTHA>可能是我此生扮演过的最伟大的角色
<30-5,MARTHA>perhaps the greatest role that I have ever played--

1122
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,250
<30-6,MARTHA>那就是
<30-6,MARTHA>That...

1123
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,950
<30-6,MARTHA>母亲
<30-6,MARTHA>Of mother.

1124
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,930
<30-7,BECKETT>太感人了
<30-7,BECKETT>That's sweet.

1125
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,800
<30-8,CASTLE>你说得没错  很感人
<30-8,CASTLE>You're right. Thats sweet.

1126
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,940
<30-10,CASTLE>抱歉
<30-10,CASTLE>Sorry.

1127
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,930
<30-11,MARTHA>如果理查德
<30-11,MARTHA>Now if Richard

1128
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,920
<30-11,MARTHA>扮演儿子这个角色时  也能像我一样
<30-11,MARTHA>had only been able to embrace the role of son

1129
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,700
<30-11,MARTHA>倾注那么多心血就好了
<30-11,MARTHA>with the same level of commitment.

1130
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,630
<30-12,CASTLE>果然还是回到了黑暗森林
<30-12,CASTLE>And into the woods we go.
