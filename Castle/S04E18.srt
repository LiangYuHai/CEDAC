42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,920

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,910
<3-5,MARTHA>提一提我的表演学校
<3-5,MARTHA>put it into one of her columns.

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,500
<3-5,MARTHA>这会是非常有效的宣传
<3-5,MARTHA>It would be invaluable publicity.

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,440
<3-6,CASTLE>是的  但那得看怎么提
<3-6,CASTLE>Yes, well, that would depend on the mention.

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,080
<3-6,CASTLE>你没忘记她对你在《热铁皮屋顶上的猫》中
<3-6,CASTLE>You aren't forgetting her blistering review...of your performance

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,120
<3-6,CASTLE>饰演的玛吉的刻薄评论吧
<3-6,CASTLE>of Maggie in "Cat on a hot tin roof", are you?

49
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,340
<3-7,MARTHA>那是1983年
<3-7,MARTHA>That was 1983.

50
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,590
<3-7,MARTHA>事情已经过去了

<3-8,CASTLE>"Martha Rodgers as Maggie the cat

53
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,310
<3-8,CASTLE>更像一只无助的猫咪
<3-8,CASTLE>is more of a helpless kitten,

54
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,430
<3-8,CASTLE>只要不能如愿就又是拍手又是喵喵叫"
<3-8,CASTLE>mewing and flapping her hands when she doesn't get her way."

55
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,390
<3-9,MARTHA>你记下来了
<3-9,MARTHA>You memorized it?

56
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,550
<3-10,CASTLE>没办法
<3-10,CASTLE>I couldn't help it.

57
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,170
<3-10,CASTLE>几个月里你都在公寓里走来走去念叨着这句话
<3-10,CASTLE>You walked around the apartment quoting it for months.

58
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,780
<3-10,CASTLE>妈妈  我想说的是
<3-10,CASTLE>Mother, I'm just saying,

59
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,890
<3-10,CASTLE>也许找一个曾对你不怎么友善的人
<3-10,CASTLE>maybe it's not a good idea to ask

60
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,720
<3-10,CASTLE>帮你这么重要的忙
<3-10,CASTLE>an important favor of someone who's been

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,750
<3-10,CASTLE>不是个好主意
<3-10,CASTLE>so... unkind to you in the past.

62
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,580
<3-11,MARTHA>这里的关键词是"曾"
<3-11,MARTHA>The operative word here is "Past."

63
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,350
<3-11,MARTHA>我想我可以不受这事的影响
<3-11,MARTHA>I think I can rise above.

64
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,260
<3-11,MARTHA>另外  我的表演学校
<3-11,MARTHA>Besides, my acting school

65
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,640
<3-11,MARTHA>对我来说比那些陈年旧事重要多了
<3-11,MARTHA>is more important to me than some old grudge.

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,340
<3-12,CASTLE>这可真成熟  妈妈
<3-12,CASTLE>Well, that's very mature of you, mother.

<3-13,MARTHA>谢谢
<3-13,MARTHA>Thank you.

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,750
<3-14,CASTLE>"如果田纳西·威廉斯知道玛莎·罗杰斯
<3-14,CASTLE>"If Tennessee Williams knew what crimes Martha Rodgers

<3-14,CASTLE>以他的名义对观众犯下的罪行
<3-14,CASTLE>had committed against this audience in his name,

71
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,710
<3-14,CASTLE>他会以伤害罪逮捕她"
<3-14,CASTLE>he would have her arrested for assault."

72
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,240
<3-15,MARTHA>不受影响
<3-15,MARTHA>Rising above.

73
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,240
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>别逗了  卡塞尔  这个剧作家能有多刻薄
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>Come on, Castle. How mean can this critic be?

74
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,860
<4-2,CASTLE>我只是怕她是在自寻伤心
<4-2,CASTLE>I'm just afraid that she's gonna get her heart broken, you know?

75
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,640
<4-2,CASTLE>你知道我妈妈
<4-2,CASTLE>I mean, you know my mother.

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,340
<4-2,CASTLE>看外表  坚强自信
<4-2,CASTLE>On the exterior, she's a tough cookie.

77
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,070
<4-2,CASTLE>她的虚张声势其实掩藏了
<4-2,CASTLE>But underneath all that bravado--

78
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
<4-2,CASTLE>她脆弱的心
<4-2,CASTLE>gooey center.

79
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,020
<5-1,BECKETT>蕾妮
<5-1,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

80
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,480
<5-1,BECKETT>死者是谁
<5-1,BECKETT>So who's our victim?

81
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,360
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>奥黛特·莫顿
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>Odette Morton.

82
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,990
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>死因是心脏中一枪
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>'cause of death is a single G.S.W. to the heart.

83
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,540
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>可能是9毫米的子弹  她当场死亡
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>Probably a 9 millimeter. She died instantly.

84
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,830
<5-3,RICHARD CASTLE>子弹穿透了她的身体
<5-3,RICHARD CASTLE>The bullet went right through her.

85
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,180
<5-4,BECKETT>除非凶手用了消音器
<5-4,BECKETT>Well, unless our killer used a silencer

86
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,480
<5-4,BECKETT>否则肯定有人听到枪声
<5-4,BECKETT>someone must have heard the shot.

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,870
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>不一定
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Not necessarily.

88
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,140
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>根据舞台经理说的  开始录制节目时
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>According to the stage manager, this area clears out

89
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,120
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这里就没人了
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>once taping starts.

90
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,800
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>另外开幕焰火也会掩盖枪声
<5-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Plus the opening pyrotechnics could've covered a gunshot.

91
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,710
<5-6,BECKETT>那前提是她正好是在节目开场时中枪的
<5-6,BECKETT>Well, that's assuming that she was shot just as the show started.

92
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,990
<5-7,LANIE>看起来就是这样
<5-7,LANIE>It looks like she was.

93
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,200
<5-8,ESPOSITO>是的
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the, uh,

94
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,820
<5-8,ESPOSITO>化妆师在三点差一刻给奥黛特画完妆
<5-8,ESPOSITO>makeup girl finished with Odette at 2:45,

95
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,370
<5-8,ESPOSITO>三点开始录制节目
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Taping starts at 3:00,

96
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,040
<5-8,ESPOSITO>三点过四分发现她的尸体
<5-8,ESPOSITO>and she was discovered at 3:04.

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,160
<5-9,CASTLE>十九分钟  很短的时间区
<5-9,CASTLE>19 minutes. That's not a very big window.

98
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,750
<5-10,BECKETT>去问问有没有员工看见有谁靠近这间房间
<5-10,BECKETT>All right, see if the crew saw anyone near this room around that time.

99
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,980
<5-11,ESPOSITO>没问题
<5-11,ESPOSITO>You got it.

100
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,390
<5-12,BECKETT>莱恩  能给我份今晚被邀请来
<5-12,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. Can I get a list of all the guests

101
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,450
<5-12,BECKETT>参与录制的所有来宾
<5-12,BECKETT>that were invited to tonight's taping

102
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,140
<5-12,BECKETT>和在保安那里登过记的人员名单吗
<5-12,BECKETT>along with anyone that checked in at security?

103
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,080
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>已经在统计了
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>Uh, already on it,

104
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,330
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>但那不是唯一的入口
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>but that's not the only way in here.

105
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,400
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>大厅的走廊尽头还有一个安全出口
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>There's an exit door to the alley down the hall.

106
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,690
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>工作人员经常把门开着
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>The crew guys like to prop it open

107
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,900
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>好出去抽根烟
<5-13,KEVIN RYAN>so they can go out for a smoke.

108
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,200
<5-14,CASTLE>那么要么凶手碰巧找到了没锁的们
<5-14,CASTLE>So either our killer got lucky and found an unlocked door...

109
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,600
<5-15,BECKETT>要么是内部人员作案
<5-15,BECKETT>Or this was an inside job.

110
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,920
<5-16,LANIE>我也认为是这样
<5-16,LANIE>That gets my vote.

111
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,350
<5-16,LANIE>奥黛特肯定会胜出
<5-16,LANIE>Odette was a lock to win this thing.

112
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,520
<5-16,LANIE>我打赌是她哪个卑鄙的对手干的
<5-16,LANIE>I bet it was one of her backstabbing rivals that did this.

113
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,110
<5-17,LANIE>怎么啦  我看这个节目
<5-17,LANIE>What? I watch the show.

114
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,110
<5-17,LANIE>奥黛特是我最喜欢的选手
<5-17,LANIE>Odette was my favorite contestant.

115
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,650
<5-17,LANIE>她是有钱祖父养大的女继承人
<5-17,LANIE>She was an heiress raised by her rich grandpa,

116
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,650
<5-17,LANIE>一个误入歧途的派对女郎
<5-17,LANIE>a party girl headed down the wrong path,

117
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,560
<5-17,LANIE>与死亡擦肩而过令她幡然醒悟
<5-17,LANIE>then a brush with death made her wake up

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,160
<5-17,LANIE>改变了她的坏女孩作风
<5-17,LANIE>and change her bad-girl ways.

119
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,710
<5-18,CASTLE>故事不错
<5-18,CASTLE>That's a great story.

120
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,680
<5-19,LANIE>就是结局不如人意
<5-19,LANIE>Except for the ending.

121
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,030
<5-20,RYAN>我得说  帕里什医生
<5-20,RYAN>I gotta say, Dr. Parish.

122
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,010
<5-20,RYAN>没想到你会是《热舞之夜》的粉丝
<5-20,RYAN>I never figured you for a fan of "A night of dance".

123
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,290
<5-21,LANIE>其实我不是
<5-21,LANIE>I'm not exactly.

124
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,540
<5-21,LANIE>只是
<5-21,LANIE>It's just...

125
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,600
<5-21,LANIE>我小时候  最大的梦想就是
<5-21,LANIE>When I was young, more than anything,

126
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,380
<5-21,LANIE>成为首席芭蕾舞演员
<5-21,LANIE>I wanted to be a prima ballerina.

127
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,290
<5-21,LANIE>我没跳舞的时候心里也想着跳舞
<5-21,LANIE>If I wasn't dancing, I was thinking about dancing.

128
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,060
<5-22,CASTLE>那么发生了什么事
<5-22,CASTLE>So what happened?

129
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,440
<5-23,LANIE>我十三岁的时候开始发育
<5-23,LANIE>The girls came along when I was 13.

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,790
<5-23,LANIE>跳芭蕾的没几个是波涛汹涌的
<5-23,LANIE>Not that many top-heavy ballerinas out there.

131
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,150
<5-24,CASTLE>我觉得该多点这样的
<5-24,CASTLE>Well, I think there should be.

132
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,950
<5-25,BECKETT>你当然喜闻乐见了
<5-25,BECKETT>Of course you do.

133
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,630
<5-26,CASTLE>我不是这个意思
<5-26,CASTLE>That's not what I meant.

134
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,320
<5-27,CASTLE>不过呢...
<5-27,CASTLE>Although...

135
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,670
<5-28,BECKETT>奥黛特有什么亲属吗
<5-28,BECKETT>Does Odette have any next of kin?

136
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,550
<5-29,LANIE>保罗·莫顿  她的哥哥
<5-29,LANIE>Um, Paul Morton, her brother.

137
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,780
<5-30,BECKETT>好  把他带过来
<5-30,BECKETT>Okay, great. Bring him down here.

138
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,470
<5-30,BECKETT>和剩下的选手聊聊
<5-30,BECKETT>And talk to the rest of the contestants,

139
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,050
<5-30,BECKETT>我想知道是不是有人
<5-30,BECKETT>I want to see if anyone is taking this competition

140
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,920
<5-30,BECKETT>把这场比赛看的太认真了
<5-30,BECKETT>just a little too seriously.

141
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,340
<6-1,ESPOSITO>我们了解到你和奥黛特
<6-1,ESPOSITO>We understand that you and Odette

142
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,420
<6-1,ESPOSITO>一整天都在排练你们的舞蹈
<6-1,ESPOSITO>were rehearsing your dance most of the day.

143
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,530
<6-1,ESPOSITO>她看起来怎么样
<6-1,ESPOSITO>How did she seem?

144
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,700
<6-2,SANTINO>她很紧张  我们两个都是
<6-2,SANTINO>On edge. We both were.

145
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,480
<6-2,SANTINO>我们之中会有一个人被淘汰
<6-2,SANTINO>I mean, one of us was about to be eliminated,

146
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,690
<6-2,SANTINO>所以我不敢相信她彩排到11点就走了
<6-2,SANTINO>which is why I can't believe she just left rehearsal at 11:00

147
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,830
<6-2,SANTINO>竟然离开了半个小时
<6-2,SANTINO>and took off for half an hour.

148
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,920
<6-3,ESPOSITO>-去做什么了  -她不说
<6-3,ESPOSITO>- To do what? - She wouldn't say.

149
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,930
<6-4,SANTINO>但是这支舞将决定一切
<6-4,SANTINO>But everything was riding on this dance.

150
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,570
<6-5,JEANINE>她告诉我她要去见一个朋友
<6-5,JEANINE>She told me she had to meet a friend.

151
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,180
<6-5,JEANINE>如果有人找她让我掩护一下
<6-5,JEANINE>She asked me to cover if anyone was looking for her.

152
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,160
<6-6,RYAN>你知道她
<6-6,RYAN>Um... do you have any idea

153
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,810
<6-6,RYAN>为什么遮遮掩掩的吗
<6-6,RYAN>why she was being so secretive?

154
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,700
<6-7,JEANINE>制作人不喜欢我们在演出当天离开演播室
<6-7,JEANINE>The producers don't like us to leave the studio on show day.

155
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,900
<6-7,JEANINE>所以一定是重要的事
<6-7,JEANINE>So it must have been important.

156
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,030
<6-8,ESPOSITO>纽约警察局
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Well, the NYPD thanks you

157
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,590
<6-8,ESPOSITO>感谢你的配合
<6-8,ESPOSITO>for your cooperation.

158
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,770
<6-9,RYAN>也感谢你
<6-9,RYAN>You, too.

159
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,820
<6-10,RYAN>靠
<6-10,RYAN>Damn.

160
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,070
<6-10,RYAN>-你看见了吗  -嗯
<6-10,RYAN>- Did you see that? - Mm-hmm.

161
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,950
<6-11,ESPOSITO>她好像装作我不存在一样
<6-11,ESPOSITO>She acted like I didn't even exist.

162
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,000
<6-12,RYAN>你确实不存在
<6-12,RYAN>You don't.

163
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,840
<6-13,ESPOSITO>你带上戒指的那一刻起你就不存在了
<6-13,ESPOSITO>Not since you put that ring on your finger.

164
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,800
<6-13,ESPOSITO>习惯单身女性把你当隐形人的现实吧
<6-13,ESPOSITO>Get used to being invisible to single women.

165
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,640
<7-1,PAUL MORTON>我从来没有见她像过去几个月这么开心过
<7-1,PAUL MORTON>I've never seen her happier than these past couple months.

166
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,830
<7-1,PAUL MORTON>我真不敢想象我的妹妹死了
<7-1,PAUL MORTON>I can't believe that my sister's dead.

167
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,100
<7-2,CASTLE>我们知道她
<7-2,CASTLE>We understand she had some...

168
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,510
<7-2,CASTLE>过去有一些困难
<7-2,CASTLE>difficulties in the past.

169
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,800
<7-3,PAUL>几年前  我们的祖父去世了
<7-3,PAUL>A few years ago, our grandfather passed away,

170
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
<7-3,PAUL>奥黛特很难接受这个事实
<7-3,PAUL>and Odette took it hard.

171
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,580
<7-3,PAUL>她退了学
<7-3,PAUL>Uh, she quit school,

172
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,610
<7-3,PAUL>和一个很好的人分了手
<7-3,PAUL>she broke off her relationship with a nice guy,

173
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,370
<7-3,PAUL>开始和不正经的人鬼混
<7-3,PAUL>started hanging out with a bad crowd.

174
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,420
<7-4,BECKETT>什么样的不正经人呢
<7-4,BECKETT>What kind of bad crowd?

175
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,980
<7-4,BECKETT>派对动物和吸毒的
<7-4,BECKETT>You know, partiers and druggies.

176
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,400
<7-5,PAUL>她被逮捕了很多次
<7-5,PAUL>She was arrested several times.

177
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,120
<7-5,PAUL>但是事故过后  她就改过自新了
<7-5,PAUL>But after the accident, she left all of that behind.

178
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,320
<7-6,CASTLE>你是指她差点死掉那次
<7-6,CASTLE>That was her brush with death?

179
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,730
<7-7,PAUL>是去年的一次火车脱轨事件
<7-7,PAUL>It was a train derailment last year.

180
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,280
<7-7,PAUL>奥黛特在车上
<7-7,PAUL>Odette was on board.

181
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,300
<7-7,PAUL>她成功得活下来了  但把她吓得不轻
<7-7,PAUL>She made it out alive, but it scared the hell out of her.

182
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,860
<7-7,PAUL>于是她改变了自己的人生轨迹
<7-7,PAUL>She turned her life around.

183
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,940
<7-7,PAUL>六个月的舞蹈训练  接下来我知道的就是
<7-7,PAUL>Six months of dance training, and the next thing that I know,

184
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,440
<7-7,PAUL>她试镜了《热舞之夜》
<7-7,PAUL>she's auditioned for "A night of dance"

185
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,870
<7-7,PAUL>而且被选中了
<7-7,PAUL>and been accepted.

186
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,080
<7-7,PAUL>她终于找到了人生中的方向
<7-7,PAUL>She finally found a direction in life.

187
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,630
<7-7,PAUL>她差一点就圆了自己的梦
<7-7,PAUL>She was so close to realizing her dream.

188
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,140
<7-8,BECKETT>奥黛特生前有没有
<7-8,BECKETT>Was there anyone in Odette's old life

189
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,860
<7-8,BECKETT>可能给她带来麻烦的人
<7-8,BECKETT>that could've come back to cause trouble for her?

190
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,570
<7-9,PAUL>据我所知没有
<7-9,PAUL>Not that I'm aware of.

191
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,440
<7-10,CASTLE>演出中呢  有没有和她不合的人
<7-10,CASTLE>What about on the show? Anyone she didn't get along with?

192
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,300
<7-11,PAUL>呃  她确实提到了一个人
<7-11,PAUL>Uh, uh, she did mention someone,

193
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,770
<7-11,PAUL>另外一个选手
<7-11,PAUL>another contestant.

194
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,750
<7-11,PAUL>我记着她说他的名字是艾迪
<7-11,PAUL>I think she said his name was Eddie.

195
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,220

204
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,850
<8-6,BECKETT>奥黛特告诉她的哥哥剧组里
<8-6,BECKETT>Now Odette told her brother that there was someone

205
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,710
<8-6,BECKETT>有个人和她合不来
<8-6,BECKETT>on the show that she didn't get along with.

206
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,160
<8-7,MAX>艾迪·戈登  但是他已经不在了
<8-7,MAX>Eddie Gordon, but he's not here anymore.

207
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,750
<8-7,MAX>上周  艾迪和奥黛特在淘汰赛中
<8-7,MAX>Last week, Eddie and Odette performed

208
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,850
<8-7,MAX>表演了一段受鲍勃·弗希启发的一段舞蹈
<8-7,MAX>a Bob-Fosse-inspired number for the elimination dance-off.

209
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,900
<8-7,MAX>我们投票把艾迪淘汰了
<8-7,MAX>We voted and sent Eddie home.

210
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,520
<8-7,MAX>他很沮丧
<8-7,MAX>He was upset.

211
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,630
<8-8,BECKETT>-有多沮丧  -你得知道
<8-8,BECKETT>- How upset? - Well, you have to understand,

212
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,460
<8-9,MAX>所有的参赛者都会在节目中
<8-9,MAX>all the contestants are cast on this show

213
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,560
<8-9,MAX>讲述他们独特但又熟悉的故事
<8-9,MAX>to tell their unique yet familiar stories.

214
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040
<8-9,MAX>奥黛特是个可怜的富家女孩
<8-9,MAX>Odette was the poor little rich girl,

215
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,090
<8-9,MAX>而艾迪却是个贫穷的痞子
<8-9,MAX>and Eddie was the kid from the wrong side of the tracks.

216
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,250
<8-10,MAX>我们选艾迪是为了戏剧效果
<8-10,MAX>We cast Eddie to bring the drama.

217
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,300
<8-10,MAX>艾迪带来了戏剧效果
<8-10,MAX>Eddie brought the drama

218
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,560
<8-10,MAX>而他带来的戏剧效果不光光是镜头前的
<8-10,MAX>and not just for the cameras.

219
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,380
<8-10,MAX>我们让他打包走人的时候他很生气
<8-10,MAX>He was furious when we sent him packing.

220
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,530
<8-10,MAX>话讲的相当难听
<8-10,MAX>and we all got an earful about it.

221
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,010
<8-11,PAM>他太无礼了
<8-11,PAM>Oh, and he was so rude.

222
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,180
<8-12,PIERRE>我不得不叫保安
<8-12,PIERRE>I had to call security.

223
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,040
<8-13,BECKETT>他有威胁任何人吗
<8-13,BECKETT>Was he threatening?

224
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,950
<8-14,MAX>这么说吧  他走了之后我松了一口气
<8-14,MAX>Let's just say, I was relieved when he was gone.

225
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:45,930
<8-14,MAX>不过真是很讽刺
<8-14,MAX>Ironic, really.

226
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,770
<8-15,CASTLE>为什么
<8-15,CASTLE>How so?

227
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,890
<8-16,MAX>根据赛制
<8-16,MAX>Well, according to the rules,

228
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,380
<8-16,MAX>当一个参赛者不能继续参赛
<8-16,MAX>when a contestant is unable to continue,

229
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,230
<8-16,MAX>上一个被淘汰的舞者会回来
<8-16,MAX>the last eliminated dancer returns

230
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,500
<8-16,MAX>代替他或她的位置
<8-16,MAX>to take his or her place.

231
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,400
<8-17,CASTLE>而那个人就是艾迪·戈登
<8-17,CASTLE>And that dancer is Eddie Gordon.

232
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,250
<9-1,EDDIE>让我告诉你一些
<9-1,EDDIE>Let me tell you something

233
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,970
<9-1,EDDIE>关于单纯可爱小姐奥黛特的事吧
<9-1,EDDIE>about Miss sweet-and-innocent Odette.

234
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,870
<9-1,EDDIE>她今天晚上阴我
<9-1,EDDIE>She threw me under the bus tonight.

235
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,670
<9-1,EDDIE>她缺席了整整一周的彩排
<9-1,EDDIE>She blew off rehearsals all week,

236
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,090
<9-1,EDDIE>她搞错了自己的舞步  还把失误怪在我身上
<9-1,EDDIE>then messed up her footwork and blames it on me.

237
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,200
<9-1,EDDIE>知道按我们那儿的规矩
<9-1,EDDIE>Where I'm from, we know what to do

238
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,730
<9-1,EDDIE>怎么对付这样撒谎的婊子吗
<9-1,EDDIE>with lying bitches like that.

239
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,850
<9-2,ESPOSITO>那是艾迪的临别采访
<9-2,ESPOSITO>That was Eddie's exit interview.

240
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,780
<9-2,ESPOSITO>制片人鼓励选手们放开了说
<9-2,ESPOSITO>The contestants are encouraged by producers to speak freely.

241
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,190
<9-3,CASTLE>他显然是采纳了他们的意见
<9-3,CASTLE>He certainly took their advice.

242
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,510
<9-4,RYAN>艾迪在罗切斯特有犯罪记录
<9-4,RYAN>Eddie has got a record back home in Rochester,

243
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,510
<9-4,RYAN>一位《热舞之夜》的助理说
<9-4,RYAN>and one of the assistants at "A night of dance"

244
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,420
<9-4,RYAN>记得在奥黛特被杀的那天下午
<9-4,RYAN>says they remember seeing him in the studio

245
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,110
<9-4,RYAN>在摄影棚看到了他
<9-4,RYAN>the afternoon Odette was murdered.

246
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,290
<9-5,BECKETT>那么艾迪被淘汰了
<9-5,BECKETT>Okay, so Eddie was eliminated,

247
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,010
<9-5,BECKETT>但是他知道如果奥黛特不能参加比赛
<9-5,BECKETT>but he knew that if Odette was out of the running,

248
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,820
<9-5,BECKETT>他就会被叫回来代替她的位置
<9-5,BECKETT>he'd be asked to return and take her slot.

249
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,320
<9-6,CASTLE>所以他回来"淘汰"奥黛特
<9-6,CASTLE>So he went back and eliminated Odette...

250
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,210
<9-6,CASTLE>永久地淘汰
<9-6,CASTLE>Permanently.

260
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,670
<10-1,BECKETT>入室抢劫  盗窃
<10-1,BECKETT>B&E, robbery--

261
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,430
<10-1,BECKETT>你在罗切斯特还真是忙啊  艾迪
<10-1,BECKETT>you were pretty busy up in Rochester, Eddie.

262
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,230
<10-2,EDDIE GORDON>没错  但那是很久前的事了
<10-2,EDDIE GORDON>Yeah, but that was a long time ago.

263
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,100
<10-2,EDDIE GORDON>开始跳舞之后我就不过恶棍一样的生活了
<10-2,EDDIE GORDON>When I started dancing, I gave up thug life.

264
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,780
<10-3,BECKETT>但当你被淘汰的时候
<10-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that didn't stop you from going off

265
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,220
<10-3,BECKETT>你还是对评委态度很恶劣
<10-3,BECKETT>on the judges when you were eliminated.

266
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,120
<10-4,EDDIE>淘汰我是他们错误的选择
<10-4,EDDIE>Me going home was the wrong call

267
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,810
<10-4,EDDIE>我就是这么说的
<10-4,EDDIE>and I said so.

268
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,730
<10-4,EDDIE>或许我说出来了
<10-4,EDDIE>Maybe I said it loud,

269
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,530
<10-4,EDDIE>但说狠话可不代表我是杀人凶手
<10-4,EDDIE>but that don't make me no killer.

270
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,520
<10-5,CASTLE>现在奥黛特不能完成比赛
<10-5,CASTLE>Now that Odette can't finish the competition,

271
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,280
<10-5,CASTLE>上一个被淘汰的选手会被叫回来参赛
<10-5,CASTLE>the last eliminated contestant will be asked to return,

272
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,810
<10-5,CASTLE>那个人就是你  艾迪
<10-5,CASTLE>and that's you, Eddie.

273
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,750
<10-6,EDDIE>就像我爸爸曾经说的
<10-6,EDDIE>Like my daddy used to say,

274
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,480
<10-6,EDDIE>天道难测
<10-6,EDDIE>the universe works in mysterious ways.

275
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
<10-7,BECKETT>也许你决定"助天行道"
<10-7,BECKETT>And maybe you decided to give the universe just a little shove.

276
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,160
<10-8,BECKETT>录制那天你在演播室做什么
<10-8,BECKETT>So what were you doing at the studio on show day?

277
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,530
<10-9,EDDIE>我提前过来看我兄弟桑蒂诺
<10-9,EDDIE>I went by early to see my boy Santino.

278
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,800
<10-9,EDDIE>为他的大日子鼓鼓劲
<10-9,EDDIE>Give him support on his big day.

279
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,190
<10-10,BECKETT>你还真是对答如流  艾迪
<10-10,BECKETT>You got an answer for everything, don't you, Eddie?

280
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,090
<10-10,BECKETT>知道你还有什么吗
<10-10,BECKETT>And you know what else you got?

281
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,740
<10-10,BECKETT>你有动机和动手的机会
<10-10,BECKETT>You got motive and opportunity.

282
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,780
<10-11,EDDIE>这事发生时我正在城市的另一头
<10-11,EDDIE>Man, I was across town when that mess happened,

283
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,940
<10-11,EDDIE>见我的经纪人
<10-11,EDDIE>meeting my agent.

284
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,320
<10-11,EDDIE>但上周  奥黛特确实有些事缠身
<10-11,EDDIE>But last week, something was going on with Odette...

285
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,230
<10-11,EDDIE>一些和跳舞无关的事
<10-11,EDDIE>Something that didn't have nothing to do with dancing.

286
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,640
<10-12,BECKETT>-什么意思  -她练舞时不在状态
<10-12,BECKETT>- What do you mean? - She was out of it.

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,270
<10-13,EDDIE>跳错简单的舞步
<10-13,EDDIE>Missing easy steps,

288
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,530
<10-13,EDDIE>她说要去洗手间
<10-13,EDDIE>she'd say she's going to the ladies room,

289
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,860
<10-13,EDDIE>却一去半小时
<10-13,EDDIE>and then be gone for half an hour.

290
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
<10-14,CASTLE>你觉得她在干什么
<10-14,CASTLE>What do you think she was doing?

291
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,330
<10-15,EDDIE>我知道她在干什么
<10-15,EDDIE>I know what she was doing.

292
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,280
<10-15,EDDIE>我看见她从后门穿出
<10-15,EDDIE>I saw her go out the back door,

293
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,200
<10-15,EDDIE>在小巷里和个男人见面
<10-15,EDDIE>meet some guy in the alley.

294
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,700
<10-15,EDDIE>他们很严肃地谈了一会儿
<10-15,EDDIE>They talked real serious for a minute,

295
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,480
<10-15,EDDIE>然后她给了他一卷钞票
<10-15,EDDIE>then she handed him a roll of bills.

296
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,070
<10-15,EDDIE>好像有三千
<10-15,EDDIE>Looked like 3 grand easy.

297
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,430
<10-16,BECKETT>你有看清楚那个男人吗
<10-16,BECKETT>You get a good enough look at this guy?

298
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,580
<10-16,BECKETT>能为我们画幅肖像吗
<10-16,BECKETT>You think you can provide us with a sketch?

299
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,390
<10-17,EDDIE>可以  我能办到
<10-17,EDDIE>Yeah. I can do that.

300
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,950
<11-1,RYAN>艾迪·戈登说的是真话
<11-1,RYAN>So Eddie Gordon spoke the truth.

301
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,010
<11-1,RYAN>奥黛特别杀时  他确实正见经纪人
<11-1,RYAN>He was meeting with his agent when Odette was shot.

302
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,340
<11-2,CASTLE>那他说看见奥黛特在小巷里
<11-2,CASTLE>So maybe he was also telling the truth

303
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,500
<11-2,CASTLE>和个男人见面也可能是真话了
<11-2,CASTLE>about the guy he saw Odette with in the alley.

304
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,160
<11-3,RYAN>他为我们画了幅肖像
<11-3,RYAN>Well, he gave us a sketch.

305
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,620
<11-3,RYAN>但是没啥特点
<11-3,RYAN>Pretty generic, though.

306
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,330
<11-3,RYAN>深发白人帅哥
<11-3,RYAN>Handsome, caucasian, dark hair.

307
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,930
<11-4,CASTLE>可能她在中枪那天
<11-4,CASTLE>You know, that missing half-hour when Odette left rehearsal

308
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,440
<11-4,CASTLE>离开排练的半小时
<11-4,CASTLE>the day she was shot--

309
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,140
<11-4,CASTLE>就是和他在一起
<11-4,CASTLE>maybe she was with him.

310
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
<11-5,RYAN>我会让警员在演播室周围散播肖像
<11-5,RYAN>I'll have uniforms circulate the sketch around the studio,

311
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,730
<11-5,RYAN>看是否有人能认出他
<11-5,RYAN>see if anybody recognizes him.

312
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,000
<11-6,CASTLE>如果奥黛特在列车事故后回归正道
<11-6,CASTLE>Okay, so if Odette had straightened up after the train accident,

313
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,430
<11-6,CASTLE>那她在后台门外偷偷
<11-6,CASTLE>What was she doing behind the stage door

314
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,400
<11-6,CASTLE>给人一卷钱是为什么
<11-6,CASTLE>secretly giving some guy a roll of bills?

315
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,440
<11-7,RYAN>可能是毒品交易
<11-7,RYAN>Could be a drug deal.

316
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,560
<11-7,RYAN>也许奥黛特的又犯老毛病了
<11-7,RYAN>Maybe Odette was falling back into old habits.

317
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
<11-7,RYAN>银行账单上有近期的提款记录吗
<11-7,RYAN>Any recent withdrawals in her bank statement?

318
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,140
<11-8,BECKETT>没有那么大的数额  可看看...
<11-8,BECKETT>Yeah, not for that amount of money, but check out...

319
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,220
<11-8,BECKETT>这些信用卡支付记录
<11-8,BECKETT>these credit card payments.

320
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,850
<11-8,BECKETT>在过去的半年里  奥黛特的信用卡支出
<11-8,BECKETT>For the last six months, Odette's credit card spending

321
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,920
<11-8,BECKETT>都很稳定  但大约一个月前
<11-8,BECKETT>was pretty much steady, and then about a month ago,

322
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,380
<11-8,BECKETT>它却猛然增加了
<11-8,BECKETT>it suddenly shot up.

323
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,260
<11-9,CASTLE>可不是  她卡都刷爆了
<11-9,CASTLE>No kidding. Her cards were maxed out.

324
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,050
<11-9,CASTLE>花费超过十万美元了
<11-9,CASTLE>Over 100 grand in charges?

325
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,940
<11-9,CASTLE>她把这些钱都花哪了
<11-9,CASTLE>What was she spending all that money on?

326
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,930
<12-1,BECKETT>谢谢你的到来  林奇伯格先生
<12-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lynchberg.

327
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,050
<12-1,BECKETT>你既是奥黛特的业务经理
<12-1,BECKETT>You were Odette's business manager

328
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,450
<12-1,BECKETT>也是她祖父财产的遗嘱执行人吗
<12-1,BECKETT>as well as the executor of her grandfather's estate?

329
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,420
<12-2,SAMUEL LYNCHBERG>很不幸  现在还需
<12-2,SAMUEL LYNCHBERG>And now I have the unfortunate task

330
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,230
<12-2,SAMUEL LYNCHBERG>处理奥黛特的财产
<12-2,SAMUEL LYNCHBERG>of handling Odette's estate as well.

331
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,830
<12-3,BECKETT>那谁会继承她在家族信托中的份额
<12-3,BECKETT>And who inherits her share of the family trust?

332
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,930
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>遵照奥黛特的遗嘱
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>Per Odette's wishes,

333
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,130
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>份额会归格兰姆·莫顿基金会
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>it goes to the Graham Morton Foundation.

334
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,240
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>这是个慈善组织
<12-4,LYNCHBERG>It's a charitable organization.

335
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,070
<12-5,BECKETT>我留意到上月她的开销
<12-5,BECKETT>You know, I noticed a pretty big spike

336
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,540
<12-5,BECKETT>有了非常大的增幅
<12-5,BECKETT>in her spending over the last month.

337
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,830
<12-5,BECKETT>-你知道是怎么回事吗  -相信你知道
<12-5,BECKETT>- Do you have any idea what that was about? - I'm sure you know

338
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,470
<12-6,LYNCHBERG>自从三年前奥黛特的祖父过世后
<12-6,LYNCHBERG>that after Odette's grandfather passed away three years ago,

339
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,670
<12-6,LYNCHBERG>她经历了一段黑暗时期
<12-6,LYNCHBERG>she went through a bad period.

340
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,960
<12-7,BECKETT>是的  她哥哥已告知我们了
<12-7,BECKETT>Yeah, her brother filled us in--

341
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,140
<12-7,BECKETT>开派对  吸毒
<12-7,BECKETT>parties, drugs.

342
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,400
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>那时候我尤其关心的就是她的开销
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>Of particular concern to me during that time was her spending.

343
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,890
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>她会喝得烂醉  突然就买辆车
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>Odette would get drunk and spontaneously buy a car

344
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,650
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>或是投标一间新公寓
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>or put a bid down on a new apartment.

345
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,350
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>她还会为朋友的隆鼻手术买单
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>She paid for her friend's nose job--

346
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,270
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>就是随心所欲  肆意妄为
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>just whatever struck her fancy.

347
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,420
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>但在去年列车事故之后
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>But then after the train accident last year,

348
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,770
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>一切都停止了
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>all that stopped.

349
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,470
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>这使关心她的我们都舒了一口气
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>It was, uh, refreshing to those of us who cared about her.

350
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,320
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>我当时担心她上月的挥金如土是
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>I was worried that last month's credit card charges

351
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,700
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>故态复萌的表现
<12-8,LYNCHBERG>indicated that she might have been backsliding.

352
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,320
<12-9,BECKETT>她都买了什么
<12-9,BECKETT>What was she buying?

353
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,110
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>大部分都是衣服
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>Clothing mostly.

354
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,280
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>那两天大部分开销
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>The bulk of the charges were over two days

355
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,680
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>都在第五大道的一家百货公司
<12-10,LYNCHBERG>at one particular 5th Avenue Department Store.

356
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,650
<12-11,BECKETT>我想看看原始收据
<12-11,BECKETT>I'd like to see the original receipts.

357
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,620
<12-12,LYNCHBERG>当然可以
<12-12,LYNCHBERG>Of course.

358
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,790
<13-1,BECKETT>这是我见过最奇怪的大血拼了
<13-1,BECKETT>This is the weirdest spending spree I have ever seen.

359
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,640
<13-1,BECKETT>奥黛特在衣服上花了上万的美元
<13-1,BECKETT>Odette spent tens of thousands of dollars on clothes,

360
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,890
<13-1,BECKETT>但从收据来看  衣服都不是她的尺码
<13-1,BECKETT>but nothing in her size according to these receipts.

361
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,480
<13-1,BECKETT>所有的衣服都是4号
<13-1,BECKETT>Everything's in size 4.

362
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,810
<13-2,ESPOSITO>而我搜查过她的公寓
<13-2,ESPOSITO>And I went through her apartment.

363
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,580
<13-2,ESPOSITO>也没看见价值十万的新衣服
<13-2,ESPOSITO>I didn't see 100 grand worth of new clothes.

364
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,530
<13-2,ESPOSITO>也许她把它们藏起来了
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe she hid 'em.

365
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,000
<13-3,CASTLE>我听着像经典的加油卡诡计
<13-3,CASTLE>Sounds to me like the old gas card scam.

366
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,710
<13-4,BECKETT>什么意思
<13-4,BECKETT>What do you mean?

367
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,480
<13-5,CASTLE>父母对你的零用钱管得非常严
<13-5,CASTLE>Your parents put you on a strict allowance,

368
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,700
<13-5,CASTLE>但他们给你张加油卡  好让你替车加油
<13-5,CASTLE>but they give you a gas card so you can fill your car.

369
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,080
<13-5,CASTLE>你替朋友的车加油
<13-5,CASTLE>Well, you fill your friends cars,

370
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,060
<13-5,CASTLE>然后他们就给你现金
<13-5,CASTLE>and they give you cash.

371
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,930
<13-5,CASTLE>我一些在寄宿学校的朋友
<13-5,CASTLE>Some of my buddies in boarding school

372
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,780
<13-6,BECKETT>-就这样使零用钱翻了倍  -是嘛
<13-6,BECKETT>- nearly doubled their allowance. - Uh-huh.

373
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,160
<13-7,CASTLE>当然不是我
<13-7,CASTLE>Not me, of course.

374
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
<13-7,CASTLE>那...
<13-7,CASTLE>That...

375
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,300
<13-7,CASTLE>可别告诉我妈
<13-7,CASTLE>Don't tell my mother.

376
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,240
<13-8,ESPOSITO>这么说  如果奥黛特急着要现金
<13-8,ESPOSITO>So if Odette needed cash in a hurry to,

377
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,750
<13-8,ESPOSITO>比如要在小巷里付钱给谁...
<13-8,ESPOSITO>say, maybe pay off some guy in an alley...

378
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,750
<13-9,BECKETT>可每月家族信托所给的津贴
<13-9,BECKETT>But the monthly stipend from her family trust

379
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,550
<13-9,BECKETT>并不足以支付
<13-9,BECKETT>wasn't enough to cover it.

380
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,690
<13-10,CASTLE>所以她买衣服  再倒卖给朋友
<13-10,CASTLE>So she charges the clothes, sells them to her friends,

381
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,410
<13-10,CASTLE>周转点现金
<13-10,CASTLE>in some cash flow.

382
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,450
<13-11,ESPOSITO>但这些仍不够
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Which is still not enough.

383
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,730
<13-11,ESPOSITO>但信用卡刷爆  没法换钱了
<13-11,ESPOSITO>The card's maxed out, the money train stops,

384
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,960
<13-11,ESPOSITO>她不能付款给债主了
<13-11,ESPOSITO>and she can't make payment to whoever she owes.

385
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,170
<13-11,ESPOSITO>所以她死了
<13-11,ESPOSITO>She ends up dead.

386
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,330
<13-12,BECKETT>可你们真认为奥黛特有个
<13-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but do you guys think that Odette actually had

387
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,690
<13-12,BECKETT>穿4码衣服的朋友
<13-12,BECKETT>one size 4 friend

388
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,810
<13-12,BECKETT>愿意花十万美元买一堆小脚牛仔裤和
<13-12,BECKETT>willing to pay 100 grand for a bunch of pegged jeans

389
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,780
<13-12,BECKETT>一个人造兔毛手提包吗
<13-12,BECKETT>and a faux rabbit purse?

390
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,680
<13-13,CASTLE>你刚才说兔毛吗
<13-13,CASTLE>Did you say rabbit?

391
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,950
<14-1,BECKETT>贾思敏
<14-1,BECKETT>Jasmine.

392
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,940
<14-1,BECKETT>我们得谈谈
<14-1,BECKETT>We need to talk.

393
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,690
<14-1,BECKETT>你是从哪里得到这包的
<14-1,BECKETT>Where'd you get the bag?

394
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,520
<14-1,BECKETT>一个朋友给我的
<14-1,BECKETT>A friend gave it to me.

395
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,360
<15-1,BECKETT>是你的朋友奥黛特·莫顿吗
<15-1,BECKETT>Your friend Odette Morton?

396
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,180
<15-2,JASMINE>我们和售货员谈过了  贾思敏
<15-2,JASMINE>We talked to the salesperson, Jasmine.

397
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,390
<15-3,BECKETT>她说奥黛特当时跟你在一起
<15-3,BECKETT>She said that you were with Odette

398
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,860
<15-3,BECKETT>给你买了十万块的衣服
<15-3,BECKETT>when she dropped 100 grand on clothes for you.

399
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,060
<15-4,JASMINE>奥黛特是个非常慷慨的人
<15-4,JASMINE>Odette was very generous.

400
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,300
<15-5,BECKETT>但她死了
<15-5,BECKETT>She's also very dead,

401
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,440
<15-5,BECKETT>我一听就知道这是个勒索骗局
<15-5,BECKETT>and I know a blackmail scheme when I hear one.

402
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,300
<15-6,CASTLE>也许奥黛特确实遇到了一些
<15-6,CASTLE>Maybe Odette had something going on in her life

403
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,500
<15-6,CASTLE>不想让别人知道的事
<15-6,CASTLE>she wanted to keep secret.

404
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,950
<15-6,CASTLE>可是被你发现了
<15-6,CASTLE>You found out about it and told her

405
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,380
<15-6,CASTLE>想要封住你的口  就得跟你买一整柜衣服
<15-6,CASTLE>that the price for your silence was a closet full of fancy duds.

406
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,410
<15-7,JASMINE>那我为何杀她呢
<15-7,JASMINE>But why would I kill her?

407
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,860
<15-8,CASTLE>也许她不能继续满足你了  你很失望
<15-8,CASTLE>Maybe she couldn't give anymore, you got frustrated,

408
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,500
<15-8,CASTLE>然后就杀了她
<15-8,CASTLE>you killed her.

409
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,220
<15-8,CASTLE>又或者她决定公开秘密
<15-8,CASTLE>Maybe she decided to come forward herself,

410
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,220
<15-8,CASTLE>告你勒索
<15-8,CASTLE>accuse you of blackmail,

411
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,940
<15-8,CASTLE>然后你杀了她
<15-8,CASTLE>you killed her.

412
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,690
<15-8,CASTLE>贾思敏  我能想到的情节多了去了
<15-8,CASTLE>Jasmine, these are just off the top of my head.

413
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,670
<15-9,BECKETT>-我们回警局再说吧  -等等
<15-9,BECKETT>- We can finish off this conversation at the precinct. - Wait.

414
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,050
<15-10,JASMINE>上个月  我有天很晚下班
<15-10,JASMINE>Last month, I was here working late,

415
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,410
<15-10,JASMINE>正好撞见奥黛特匆忙从我的位置旁经过
<15-10,JASMINE>and I happened to see Odette walk by my desk real fast,

416
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,900
<15-10,JASMINE>一脸苦闷  然后我看到
<15-10,JASMINE>like she was upset. Next thing I know,

417
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,160
<15-10,JASMINE>布莱德·梅维尔出现了  好像是来找她
<15-10,JASMINE>here comes Brad Melville, like he's looking for her.

418
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,250
<15-11,CASTLE>布莱德·梅维尔  节目的主持吗
<15-11,CASTLE>Brad Melville, the show's host?

419
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,810
<15-11,CASTLE>《热舞之夜》的主持人来找
<15-11,CASTLE>Why would the host of "A Night of Dance"

420
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,910
<15-11,CASTLE>一个参赛选手干嘛
<15-11,CASTLE>be looking for a contestant?

421
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,130
<15-11,CASTLE>主持和选手不是禁止有交情吗
<15-11,CASTLE>Aren't they not supposed to fraternize?

422
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,590
<15-12,JASMINE>所以我跟了上去
<15-12,JASMINE>That's why I followed him.

423
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,550
<15-12,JASMINE>布莱德和奥黛特在楼梯间吵了一架
<15-12,JASMINE>Brad and Odette were in the stairwell having a fight.

424
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,290
<15-13,BECKETT>吵了些什么
<15-13,BECKETT>About what?

425
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,720
<15-14,JASMINE>我不是很清楚
<15-14,JASMINE>I'm not completely sure.

426
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,820
<15-14,JASMINE>不过我吓唬奥黛特
<15-14,JASMINE>But when I bluffed Odette

427
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,540
<15-14,JASMINE>要把她跟布莱德的事告诉麦克斯时
<15-14,JASMINE>that I was going to tell Max about her and Brad,

428
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,470
<15-14,JASMINE>她特别紧张
<15-14,JASMINE>she got really nervous.

429
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,460
<15-14,JASMINE>她说她可以给我点好处  让我别说出去
<15-14,JASMINE>She offered to buy me some stuff I wanted if I'd keep quiet.

430
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,250
<15-14,JASMINE>我觉得这交易不错
<15-14,JASMINE>And I thought that sounded like a good deal.

431
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,800
<15-14,JASMINE>但事情到此为止  我绝不会伤害奥黛特的
<15-14,JASMINE>But that's it. I would've never hurt Odette.

432
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,560
<15-15,BECKETT>不好意思  你这话实在让人难以相信
<15-15,BECKETT>You'll have to pardon me if I don't take you at your word.

433
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,640
<15-16,JASMINE>如果说有谁想杀奥黛特
<15-16,JASMINE>Look, if anyone had a reason to murder Odette,

434
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,340
<15-16,JASMINE>肯定就是布莱德
<15-16,JASMINE>it was Brad.

435
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,880
<15-16,JASMINE>我有录音为证
<15-16,JASMINE>Just listen. I recorded the two of them.

436
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,280
<15-17,BRAD>我们明明说好了的
<15-17,BRAD>We had a deal.

437
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,130
<15-18,ODETTE>如果你不说出去  我也不说
<15-18,ODETTE>And I'm willing to stand by it if you are.

438
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,940
<15-19,BRAD>我辛辛苦苦才爬到现在这个位置
<15-19,BRAD>I have worked too hard to get where I am.

439
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,610
<16-1,BRAD>如果别人知道这事  奥黛特
<16-1,BRAD>If anyone finds out about this, Odette,

440
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,300
<16-1,BRAD>你就死定了
<16-1,BRAD>I swear, I'll kill you.

441
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,030
<15-19,BRAD>麦克斯·兰弗罗要是发现布莱德·梅维尔
<15-19,BRAD>If Max Renfro found out that Brad Melville

442
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,760
<15-20,BECKETT>跟某个选手有来往
<15-20,BECKETT>was in a relationship with one of the contestants,

443
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,410
<15-20,BECKETT>他会怎么做
<15-20,BECKETT>what would happen?

444
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,890
<15-21,JASMINE>选手会被开除
<15-21,JASMINE>She'd be thrown off the show,

445
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,440
<15-21,JASMINE>主持人也是
<15-21,JASMINE>and he'd be fired.

446
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,570
<15-22,CASTLE>足够作为谋杀动机了  谁有异议不
<15-22,CASTLE>Motive for murder, anyone?

447
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,570
<16-1,BRAD>如果有别人知道这事  奥黛特
<16-1,BRAD>If anyone finds out about this, Odette,

448
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,170
<16-1,BRAD>你就死定了
<16-1,BRAD>I swear, I'll kill you.

449
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,050
<16-2,BRAD>事情不是你们听到的那样
<16-2,BRAD>That is completely not what it sounds like.

450
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,970
<16-3,BECKETT>布莱德  我们听到的是  在奥黛特
<16-3,BECKETT>What it sounds like, Brad, is you threatening

451
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,380
<16-3,BECKETT>死前数周  你威胁过奥黛特·莫顿
<16-3,BECKETT>Odette Morton's life a few weeks before she was murdered.

452
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,020
<16-4,BRAD>可我当初是想要保护她
<16-4,BRAD>But I was trying to protect her.

453
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,510
<16-5,CASTLE>怎么个保护法
<16-5,CASTLE>Protect her how?

454
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,090
<16-6,BRAD>我知道奥黛特有过一段麻烦史
<16-6,BRAD>I knew about Odette's troubled past--

455
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,650
<16-6,BRAD>总是嗑药  酒后驾车
<16-6,BRAD>the drugs, the D.U.I.s.

456
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,080
<16-6,BRAD>可她说现在都戒了  还说跳舞
<16-6,BRAD>But I also believed her when she said she was clean now

457
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,880
<16-6,BRAD>是她最在乎的事情  我也信过她
<16-6,BRAD>and that dancing was all she cared about.

458
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,530
<16-7,BECKETT>你是想说她在撒谎吗
<16-7,BECKETT>Are you trying to say that that wasn't true?

459
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,970
<16-8,BRAD>我想说的是
<16-8,BRAD>What I'm trying to say is,

460
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,590
<16-8,BRAD>两个月前  我有一天很早就去化妆
<16-8,BRAD>two months ago, I walked into makeup early one morning,

461
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,710
<16-8,BRAD>结果发现奥黛特在注射毒品
<16-8,BRAD>and found Odette shooting up.

462
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,920
<16-9,BECKETT>你确定吗
<16-9,BECKETT>Are you sure about this?

463
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,570
<16-10,BRAD>百分之百确定
<16-10,BRAD>100% positive.

464
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,010
<16-10,BRAD>要是让麦克斯知道这事
<16-10,BRAD>If Max knew she was using,

465
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,650
<16-10,BRAD>她肯定会被当场淘汰
<16-10,BRAD>she would've been eliminated on the spot.

466
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,300
<16-11,BECKETT>可你没告诉麦克斯
<16-11,BECKETT>But you never told max.

467
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,990
<16-12,BRAD>奥黛特发誓她会戒掉
<16-12,BRAD>Odette promised she would clean up.

468
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,310
<16-12,BRAD>我就给了她一次机会  但我一直有留意她
<16-12,BRAD>I gave her a second chance, but I also kept an eye on her.

469
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,280
<16-12,BRAD>然后一个月前  她又被我抓了现行
<16-12,BRAD>Then a month ago, I caught her again.

470
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,030
<16-12,BRAD>我跟她说我没法再帮她了  我得告诉麦克斯
<16-12,BRAD>I told her I was going to max, that she was on her own.

471
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,650
<16-13,CASTLE>麦克斯知道了吗
<16-13,CASTLE>And did you?

472
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,460
<16-14,BRAD>没有  因为奥黛特威胁我
<16-14,BRAD>No, because Odette threatened me.

473
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,170
<16-14,BRAD>她说如果我去麦克斯那里告密
<16-14,BRAD>She said that if I went to max and told him what I'd seen,

474
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,220
<16-14,BRAD>她就要告诉麦克斯
<16-14,BRAD>that she'd go to him and tell him that I was the one

475
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,740
<16-14,BRAD>我第一次放过了她
<16-14,BRAD>that let her off the first time.

476
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,000
<16-14,BRAD>麦克斯肯定会因为
<16-14,BRAD>Max would've fired me

477
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,790
<16-14,BRAD>我隐瞒了这么大秘密而开除我的
<16-14,BRAD>for keeping a secret that big from him.

478
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,280
<16-14,BRAD>我就做不了节目了
<16-14,BRAD>I'd be off the show.

479
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
<16-15,BECKETT>我就成了布莱恩·邓克曼
<16-15,BECKETT>I'd be Brian Dunkleman.

480
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
<16-15,BECKETT>2002年第一季美国偶像的主持之一  季终后辞职
<16-15,BECKETT>因后来节目大红  评论称其毁掉了自己的职业生涯

481
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,340
<16-15,BECKETT>布莱恩·邓克曼是谁
<16-15,BECKETT>Who's Brian Dunkleman?

482
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,600
<16-16,BRAD>看吧  没人知道他
<16-16,BRAD>Exactly.

483
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,060
<16-17,CASTLE>就是说如果奥黛特被开除  她就要拉你当垫背
<16-17,CASTLE>So... if Odette went down, she was taking you with her.

484
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,920
<17-1,RYAN>布莱德说的没错
<17-1,RYAN>Brad was right about her shooting up.

485
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,620
<17-1,RYAN>在她的珠宝箱的活底层里
<17-1,RYAN>Found these hidden in a false bottom

486
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,620
<17-1,RYAN>找到了这玩意儿  怪不得鉴证组
<17-1,RYAN>underneath her jewelry box. No wonder C.S.U. missed it.

487
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,470
<17-1,RYAN>-搜她公寓的时候没找到  -有可能是兴奋剂
<17-1,RYAN>- when they went through her apartment. - Could be speed.

488
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,350
<17-2,ESPOSITO>可我刚跟蕾妮通过电话
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, except I just got off the phone with Lanie,

489
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,680
<17-3,BECKETT>她说毒理检验报告显示
<17-3,BECKETT>and she said that preliminary tox screen results show

490
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,080
<17-3,BECKETT>奥黛特没有吸毒
<17-3,BECKETT>that Odette wasn't using drugs,

491
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,060
<17-3,BECKETT>至少不是常见的毒品
<17-3,BECKETT>at least none of the usual ones.

492
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,280
<17-3,BECKETT>这针管里头到底是什么东西
<17-3,BECKETT>So what the hell is in this bottle?

493
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,710
<17-3,BECKETT>然后我跟劳伦斯爵士说  "拉瑞  这是
<17-3,BECKETT>And so I said to Sir Laurence, "Larry, that is

495
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,180
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>这是我见过演《奥赛罗》的第二棒的演出
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>the second best performance of 'Othello' I have ever seen.

496
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,490
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>但是没有人能够超越
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>But I'm afraid no one can improve

497
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,850
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>奥森·威尔斯的表演"
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>the Orson Welles interpretation."

499
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,980
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>"拉瑞"  我对他说
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>"Larry," I said,

500
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,900
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>"你就是没他演得好"
<18-1,OONA MARCONI>"You've simply been outdone."

501
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,100
<18-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>呃  那奥利弗怎么回答的
<18-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>Wow. What did, uh, Olivier say to that?

502
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,060
<18-4,OONA>他说...
<18-4,OONA>He said...

503
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,400
<18-4,OONA>"亲爱的
<18-4,OONA>"My dear girl,

504
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,310
<18-4,OONA>你还真有戏剧评论家的天赋"
<18-4,OONA>you have the makings of a theater critic."

505
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,520
<18-5,OONA>于是我就成了评论家
<18-5,OONA>And so here I am.

506
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,650
<18-6,MARTHA>是啊  你确实有天赋
<18-6,MARTHA>Yes, indeed, you are.

507
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,680
<18-6,MARTHA>噢对了
<18-6,MARTHA>Oh, by the way,

508
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,930
<18-6,MARTHA>不知道你最近听说没
<18-6,MARTHA>I don't know if I told you that recently,

509
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,830
<18-6,MARTHA>我开了一家表演学校
<18-6,MARTHA>I opened my own acting school.

510
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,410
<18-7,OONA>玛莎
<18-7,OONA>Martha.

511
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,030
<18-7,OONA>太棒了
<18-7,OONA>How wonderful.

<18-8,MARTHA>谢谢
<18-8,MARTHA>Thank you.

513
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,390
<18-9,OONA>你能把你
<18-9,OONA>How good of you to share

<18-9,OONA>"多年"的表演经验
<18-9,OONA>your years and... years of experience

515
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,740
<18-9,OONA>跟下一代分享真是太好了
<18-9,OONA>with a new generation.

516
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,850
<18-10,CASTLE>是啊  我们都为她感到自豪
<18-10,CASTLE>Yes, we are very proud.

517
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,800
<18-11,MARTHA>我在想
<18-11,MARTHA>And I was wondering,

518
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,990
<18-11,MARTHA>或许你可以赏脸来我的学校
<18-11,MARTHA>perhaps you might consider stopping by

519
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,080
<18-11,MARTHA>旁听一两堂课
<18-11,MARTHA>and sitting in on a class or two,

520
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,170
<18-11,MARTHA>如果觉得还不错的话
<18-11,MARTHA>and then if you felt so inclined,

521
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,790
<18-11,MARTHA>在你那个出色的专栏里
<18-11,MARTHA>mentioning our little school

522
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,820
<18-11,MARTHA>提几句我学校的事
<18-11,MARTHA>in one of your wonderful columns.

523
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,920
<18-12,OONA>我乐意之至
<18-12,OONA>I'd be happy to do that.

524
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,180
<18-12,OONA>你把时间地点告诉我就好
<18-12,OONA>You just tell me where and when.

525
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,270
<18-13,MARTHA>那太好了
<18-13,MARTHA>Well, that's lovely.

526
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,560
<18-14,OONA>希望你别把你那个在说重要台词前
<18-14,OONA>I just hope you're not teaching your students

527
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,320
<18-14,OONA>把头往一边倾斜的
<18-14,OONA>your little trick of tilting your head

528
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,520
<18-14,OONA>小动作教给学生们
<18-14,OONA>before delivering an important line of dialogue.

529
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,380
<18-15,MARTHA>我哪有这个动作
<18-15,MARTHA>I don't do that.

530
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,870
<18-16,OONA>你演"小猫"玛吉的时候就是这样的
<18-16,OONA>Well, you did it when you played Maggie the cat.

531
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,040
<18-17,OONA>对了  你双手还会像小鸟振翅那样抖动
<18-17,OONA>Oh, and you fluttered your hands like little bird wings.

532
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,770
<18-17,OONA>我一直等着你飞起来呢
<18-17,OONA>I kept waiting for you to take off.

533
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,840
<18-18,CASTLE>谁要吃派吗
<18-18,CASTLE>Who wants pie?

534
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,720
<18-18,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你能不能
<18-18,CASTLE>Alexis, would you--

535
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,990
<18-18,CASTLE>谢谢
<18-18,CASTLE>Thank you.

536
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,710
<18-19,MARTHA>我记得那年我获得了托尼奖的提名
<18-19,MARTHA>I believe that was the year that I was nominated for a Tony.

537
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,680
<18-20,OONA>也许比起我  美国戏剧协会
<18-20,OONA>Well, perhaps the American Theatre Wing

538
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,760
<18-20,OONA>对于歪头和乱挥手更宽容一些
<18-20,OONA>is more tolerant of head tilting and hand fluttering than I am.

539
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,290
<18-21,OONA>玛莎  我只是在开玩笑
<18-21,OONA>Oh, Martha, I'm just teasing.

540
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,230
<18-21,OONA>你不会还在为以前的那则评论生气吧
<18-21,OONA>You can't possibly still be upset about that old review.

541
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,910
<18-22,CASTLE>咱们别说会觉得后悔的话
<18-22,CASTLE>Let's not say anything we'll regret.

542
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,600
<18-23,MARTHA>那就不叫评论  那是诽谤
<18-23,MARTHA>That was no review. That was a hatchet job.

543
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,060
<18-23,MARTHA>根本就是毫无理由的恶意诽谤
<18-23,MARTHA>It was vicious and it was uncalled for.

544
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,860
<18-24,OONA>不过那的确是大实话
<18-24,OONA>And it was also accurate.

545
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,450
<18-25,CASTLE>别受影响
<18-25,CASTLE>Rise above.

546
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,430
<18-26,MARTHA>知道吗  乌娜  我撤回我的邀请
<18-26,MARTHA>You know what, Oona? I rescind my request.

547
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,140
<18-26,MARTHA>我现在绝不会接受你对我学校的赞扬
<18-26,MARTHA>There is no way I would accept your endorsement of my school now

548
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,560
<18-26,MARTHA>哪怕你求我
<18-26,MARTHA>if you begged me.

549
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,380
<18-27,OONA>没可能
<18-27,OONA>Fat chance of that.

550
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,410
<18-27,OONA>你记住  玛莎
<18-27,OONA>Just remember, Martha,

551
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,660
<18-27,OONA>演不利者  从教
<18-27,OONA>those who can't do teach.

552
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,090
<18-28,MARTHA>教不利者
<18-28,MARTHA>And those who can't teach

553
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,030
<18-28,MARTHA>评
<18-28,MARTHA>become theater critics.

554
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,970
<18-29,ALEXIS>奶奶
<18-29,ALEXIS>Gram.

555
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,160
<18-30,CASTLE>本可能更糟的
<18-30,CASTLE>Could've been worse.

556
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,320
<18-30,CASTLE>糟到极致了
<18-30,CASTLE>It couldn't have been worse.

557
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,870
<19-1,CASTLE>我妈妈敞开心扉
<19-1,CASTLE>My mother exposed her gooey center,

558
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,730
<19-1,CASTLE>乌娜·马可尼却扎了把刀子上去
<19-1,CASTLE>and Oona Marconi drove a stake through it.

559
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,100
<19-2,BECKETT>帮我转告她  我深表同情
<19-2,BECKETT>Well, tell her, I feel her pain.

560
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,350
<19-3,CASTLE>谢了  我会的  案子有什么进展吗
<19-3,CASTLE>Thanks. I will. Anything new on the case?

561
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,530
<19-4,BECKETT>警员找到了奥黛特遇害当天上午11点
<19-4,BECKETT>Yeah, unis found the cafe that Odette went to at 11:00 a.m.

562
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,890
<19-4,BECKETT>她去过的咖啡馆
<19-4,BECKETT>the day that she was killed.

563
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,380
<19-5,CASTLE>是去和神秘男子交易毒品吗
<19-5,CASTLE>Scoring drugs off her mystery man?

564
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,670
<19-6,BECKETT>是去喝杯脱脂拿铁
<19-6,BECKETT>More like scoring a fat-free latte.

565
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,480
<19-6,BECKETT>她约了个朋友喝咖啡
<19-6,BECKETT>She met up with a friend for coffee.

566
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,900
<19-6,BECKETT>苏珊·斯坦纳
<19-6,BECKETT>Suzanne Steiner.

567
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,090
<19-7,CASTLE>朋友
<19-7,CASTLE>A friend?

568
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,660
<19-7,CASTLE>录制日擅自离开可是件大事
<19-7,CASTLE>Leaving the studio on show day was a very big deal.

569
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,250
<19-7,CASTLE>有什么重要的事这么刻不容缓
<19-7,CASTLE>What was so important that it couldn't wait?

570
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,450
<19-8,BECKETT>苏珊说  她只是想叙叙旧
<19-8,BECKETT>According to Suzanne, she just wanted to talk about old times.

571
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,110
<19-9,RYAN>实验室发来份传真
<19-9,RYAN>Hey, we got a fax from the lab.

572
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,430
<19-9,RYAN>我们在奥黛特公寓找到的小瓶清澈液体
<19-9,RYAN>That clear vial of liquid that we found at Odette's apartment?

573
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,550
<19-9,RYAN>不是违禁药品
<19-9,RYAN>It wasn't illegal drugs.

574
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,690
<19-9,RYAN>是胰岛素
<19-9,RYAN>It's insulin.

575
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,650
<19-10,CASTLE>奥黛特有糖尿病吗
<19-10,CASTLE>Odette was diabetic?

576
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,950
<19-11,RYAN>她医生说没有
<19-11,RYAN>Not according to her doctor.

577
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,790
<19-11,RYAN>他说已经一年多没见过她了
<19-11,RYAN>He said he hasn't seen her in over a year.

578
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,460
<19-12,BECKETT>也许她是最近患上的
<19-12,BECKETT>Well, maybe she developed it recently

579
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,910
<19-12,BECKETT>有或者她换了个医生
<19-12,BECKETT>or maybe she went to a new doctor.

580
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,700
<19-13,CASTLE>那为什么不直接告诉布莱德·梅维尔实情呢
<19-13,CASTLE>Then why not just tell Brad Melville the truth,

581
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,590
<19-13,CASTLE>那并不是甲基苯丙胺[一种兴奋剂]只是胰岛素
<19-13,CASTLE>that it wasn't speed, it was insulin?

582
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,940
<19-13,CASTLE>何必要贿赂贾思敏呢
<19-13,CASTLE>And why bother buying Jasmine half of 5th Avenue to keep it quiet?

583
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,700
<19-14,ESPOSITO>我想我知道答案
<19-14,ESPOSITO>Well, I think I can help with that.

584
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,760
<19-14,ESPOSITO>奥黛特家的鉴证报告出来了
<19-14,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. report is back on Odette's place.

585
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,210
<19-14,ESPOSITO>他们只发现了一组指纹
<19-14,ESPOSITO>They only found one set of prints

586
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,380
<19-14,ESPOSITO>却不属于奥黛特
<19-14,ESPOSITO>and they were not Odette's.

587
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,980
<19-14,ESPOSITO>是一个叫芭芭拉·兰戴尔的女人的
<19-14,ESPOSITO>They belong to a woman named Barbra Landau.

588
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,510
<19-15,BECKETT>芭芭拉·兰戴尔又是谁
<19-15,BECKETT>Who the hell is Barbra Landau?

589
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,580
<19-16,ESPOSITO>是个不该跟奥黛特有交集的人
<19-16,ESPOSITO>Not someone who would run in Odette's circles.

590
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,450
<19-16,ESPOSITO>她在寄养家庭长大
<19-16,ESPOSITO>She was raised in foster care

591
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,480
<19-16,ESPOSITO>高中辍学
<19-16,ESPOSITO>and was a high school dropout.

592
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,180
<19-17,CASTLE>那她是和奥黛特一起住吗
<19-17,CASTLE>So she was staying with Odette?

593
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,300
<19-18,BECKETT>我们得和她谈谈
<19-18,BECKETT>We need to talk to her.

594
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,420
<19-19,ESPOSITO>八成是没戏了
<19-19,ESPOSITO>That's gonna be tough.

595
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,210
<19-19,ESPOSITO>据官方记录  芭芭拉·兰戴尔已经去世一年多了
<19-19,ESPOSITO>Officially, Barbra Landau has been dead for over a year.

596
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,840
<19-19,ESPOSITO>这是她的死亡证明
<19-19,ESPOSITO>Here's her death certificate.

597
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
<19-20,BECKETT>她在一场火车相撞事故中
<19-20,BECKETT>She died of blunt force trauma

598
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,730
<19-20,BECKETT>被钝器砸中致死
<19-20,BECKETT>from injuries suffered in a train collision.

599
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,440
<19-20,BECKETT>是的
<19-20,BECKETT>That's right.

600
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,640
<19-21,ESPOSITO>正是奥黛特幸存的那次火车事故
<19-21,ESPOSITO>The same train collision that Odette survived.

601
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,980
<19-21,ESPOSITO>可她真的幸存了吗
<19-21,ESPOSITO>Or did she?

602
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,650
<19-21,ESPOSITO>看到奥黛特的照片了吗
<19-21,ESPOSITO>You see that picture of Odette?

603
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,300
<19-21,ESPOSITO>这张是...
<19-21,ESPOSITO>Well, this...

604
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,500
<19-21,ESPOSITO>芭芭拉
<19-21,ESPOSITO>is Barbra.

605
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,680
<19-22,CASTLE>一模一样
<19-22,CASTLE>They're identical.

606
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,030
<19-23,BECKETT>不可能
<19-23,BECKETT>But that's impossible.

607
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,010
<19-23,BECKETT>不可能吗
<19-23,BECKETT>Impossible

608
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,490
<19-24,CASTLE>这或许是所有问题的答案
<19-24,CASTLE>or the explanation to everything?

609
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,210
<19-24,CASTLE>事故以后奥黛特发生了巨大的改变
<19-24,CASTLE>The dramatic change in Odette after the accident,

610
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,260
<19-24,CASTLE>还隐藏自己的糖尿病史
<19-24,CASTLE>the need to hide being a diabetic,

611
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,780
<19-24,CASTLE>因为奥黛特没有糖尿病
<19-24,CASTLE>because Odette was not a diabetic...

612
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,700
<19-25,BECKETT>奥黛特·莫顿并没在事故中幸存
<19-25,BECKETT>Odette Morton didn't survive that train crash.

613
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,860
<19-25,BECKETT>活下来的是芭芭拉
<19-25,BECKETT>Barbra did.

614
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,920
<19-26,CASTLE>如凤凰从灰烬中涅槃
<19-26,CASTLE>And like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

615
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,490
<19-26,CASTLE>芭芭拉·兰戴尔从火车残骸里爬出来
<19-26,CASTLE>Barbra Landau walked away from the wreckage of that train

616
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,650
<19-26,CASTLE>继而偷走了奥黛特·莫顿的生活
<19-26,CASTLE>and stole Odette Morton's life.

617
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,790
<20-1,CASTLE>双胞胎姐妹出生后被领养
<20-1,CASTLE>Twin girls are born and put up for adoption.

618
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,230
<20-1,CASTLE>奥黛特被有钱人家收养了
<20-1,CASTLE>Odette goes to a wealthy, loving family.

619
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,100
<20-1,CASTLE>芭芭拉就没那么幸运了
<20-1,CASTLE>Barbra--not so lucky.

620
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,490
<20-1,CASTLE>她辗转于寄养家庭之间
<20-1,CASTLE>She gets bounced around from one foster home to the next,

621
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,200
<20-1,CASTLE>可内心深处她一直知道
<20-1,CASTLE>always knowing deep inside

622
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,150
<20-1,CASTLE>她注定能过上更好的生活
<20-1,CASTLE>that she was meant for something better.

623
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,260
<20-1,CASTLE>然后有一天  她们在开往迈阿密的火车上相遇
<20-1,CASTLE>Then one day, the two of them meet on a train bound for Miami.

624
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,920
<20-1,CASTLE>姐妹之情一触即发
<20-1,CASTLE>The connection is instantaneous.

625
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,270
<20-1,CASTLE>在接下来的两天里  她们了解了彼此的一切
<20-1,CASTLE>In two days, they learn everything there is to know about each other,

626
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,440
<20-1,CASTLE>芭芭拉忍不住地想
<20-1,CASTLE>And Barbra can't help but think,

627
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,190
<20-1,CASTLE>假如当初我也像奥黛特那样进入富人家
<20-1,CASTLE>If only I had landed in the lap of luxury like Odette,

628
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,190
<20-1,CASTLE>我想干什么都行了
<20-1,CASTLE>I could've been anything I wanted to be.

629
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,030
<20-2,BECKETT>你是说芭芭拉为了夺走奥黛特的生活
<20-2,BECKETT>Are you suggesting that Barbra purposefully caused the derailment

630
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,620
<20-2,BECKETT>制造了脱轨事故吗
<20-2,BECKETT>to take over Odette's life?

631
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,010
<20-2,BECKETT>怎么办到的  用巫术吗
<20-2,BECKETT>With what, her crazy wiccan powers?

632
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,270
<20-3,CASTLE>那就会是个惊人大逆转了
<20-3,CASTLE>Wow, that would be an incredible twist,

633
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,550
<20-4,CASTLE>不是  当然不是
<20-4,CASTLE>But no, no.

634
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,860
<20-4,CASTLE>事故就是事故
<20-4,CASTLE>The accident happens.

635
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,640
<20-4,CASTLE>奥黛特遇害
<20-4,CASTLE>Odette is killed.

636
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,940
<20-4,CASTLE>芭芭拉幸存
<20-4,CASTLE>Barbra survives.

637
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,960
<20-4,CASTLE>混乱之中
<20-4,CASTLE>And in the midst of all the chaos and rubble,

638
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,310
<20-4,CASTLE>她看到了机会
<20-4,CASTLE>she sees her chance.

639
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,950
<20-4,CASTLE>她跟奥黛特换了身份
<20-4,CASTLE>She switches identification with Odette,

640
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,860
<20-4,CASTLE>改变了自己的命运
<20-4,CASTLE>and she changes her destiny.

641
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,540
<20-4,CASTLE>仅用一步  芭芭拉就为自己
<20-4,CASTLE>In one move, Barbra builds herself

642
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,560
<20-4,CASTLE>建立了一个更美好的未来和完美人生
<20-4,CASTLE>a better future, a perfect life.

643
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,370
<20-5,BECKETT>直到一年后还是被害了
<20-5,BECKETT>Until she was murdered a year later.

644
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,300
<20-6,CASTLE>"失散多年的双胞胎"这种故事
<20-6,CASTLE>Yeah, well, separated twin stories

645
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,120
<20-6,CASTLE>从来不会有好结局
<20-6,CASTLE>never end happily,

646
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,140
<20-6,CASTLE>除了《天生一对》
<20-6,CASTLE>except "The Parent Trap."

647
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
<20-7,RYAN>血液报告来了
<20-7,RYAN>Blood tests are back.

648
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,510
<20-7,RYAN>奥黛特和芭芭拉
<20-7,RYAN>Odette and Barbra

649
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,400
<20-7,RYAN>并没有血缘关系
<20-7,RYAN>were not biologically related.

650
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,630
<20-8,ESPOSITO>我们也找不到芭芭拉在世的家人
<20-8,ESPOSITO>And Barbra has no living family we could find.

651
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,190
<20-9,CASTLE>如果她们不是姐妹
<20-9,CASTLE>If they're not related,

652
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,190
<20-9,CASTLE>怎么可能长得这么像
<20-9,CASTLE>how can Barbra look so much like Odette?

653
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:26,860
<20-9,CASTLE>我也不知道
<20-9,CASTLE>I don't know.

654
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,980
<20-10,ESPOSITO>不过我们查到了她之前工作的地方
<20-10,ESPOSITO>But we do have an address for her former place of employment,

655
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,000
<20-10,ESPOSITO>是个市中心的脱衣舞俱乐部
<20-10,ESPOSITO>a strip club in midtown.

656
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,520
<20-11,RYAN>我们之前办案的思路是
<20-11,RYAN>See, we've been operating under the theory

657
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,820
<20-11,RYAN>奥黛特因为她自己惹的事被害
<20-11,RYAN>that Odette was murdered because she was Odette.

658
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,180
<20-11,RYAN>但如果她是因为她的真实身份而遇害呢
<20-11,RYAN>But what if she was murdered because she was really Barbra?

659
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,170
<20-12,BECKETT>查明芭芭拉的底细
<20-12,BECKETT>Find out everything you can about Barbra.

660
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:39,970
<20-12,BECKETT>与此同时
<20-12,BECKETT>In the meantime,

661
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,490
<20-12,BECKETT>我要再询问一遍奥黛特的哥哥保罗
<20-12,BECKETT>I'm gonna reinterview Odette's brother Paul.

662
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,650
<20-13,CASTLE>他现在成了嫌犯吗
<20-13,CASTLE>Is he a person of interest now?

663
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,230
<20-14,BECKETT>我只是不能相信芭芭拉
<20-14,BECKETT>I'm just having trouble believing that Barbra managed

664
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,830
<20-14,BECKETT>能瞒住奥黛特的哥哥一年多
<20-14,BECKETT>to fool Odette's own brother for over a year.

665
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,890
<20-14,BECKETT>他得让我相信他不知情
<20-14,BECKETT>He's gonna have to convince me that he didn't know.

666
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,100
<20-15,CASTLE>听起来这工作更适合
<20-15,CASTLE>Well, that sounds like something better done

667
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,530
<20-15,CASTLE>一对一死磕
<20-15,CASTLE>one-on-one, mano a mano.

668
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,630
<20-15,CASTLE>而我想和他们一起去市中心走一趟
<20-15,CASTLE>Meantime, I want to take a ride downtown with the boys,

669
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,510
<20-15,CASTLE>-去脱衣舞俱乐部溜溜  -抱歉了 卡塞尔
<20-15,CASTLE>- check out that strip club. - Sorry, Castle.

670
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,860
<20-16,RYAN>人已经满了
<20-16,RYAN>Three's a crowd.

671
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,170
<20-17,ESPOSITO>怎么了  为什么不让卡塞尔去
<20-17,ESPOSITO>What's up? Why you freezing out our boy like that?

672
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,380
<20-18,RYAN>我想做个实验
<20-18,RYAN>I want to try an experiment.

673
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,540
<20-18,RYAN>和卡塞尔一起去会搞砸的
<20-18,RYAN>Having Castle along would mess things up.

674
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,950
<20-18,RYAN>给你
<20-18,RYAN>Here.

675
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,480
<20-19,RYAN>戴上我的婚戒
<20-19,RYAN>Wear my wedding ring.

676
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,730
<20-20,ESPOSITO>干啥呢  把那东西给我拿走
<20-20,ESPOSITO>What? Get that thing away from me, man.

677
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,430
<20-20,ESPOSITO>这东西很扫兴
<20-20,ESPOSITO>It's a mood killer.

678
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,650
<20-21,RYAN>我们在夜总会时你就戴着它吧
<20-21,RYAN>Just wear it when we're at the club.

679
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,260
<20-22,ESPOSITO>为什么
<20-22,ESPOSITO>What for?

680
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,780
<20-23,RYAN>我已经和所有已婚男性朋友交流过了
<20-23,RYAN>See, I been talking to all my married guy friends,

681
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,810
<20-23,RYAN>他们说你的那套理论是胡扯
<20-23,RYAN>they say that your theory is way off.

682
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,120
<20-23,RYAN>戴着婚戒
<20-23,RYAN>Wearing a wedding ring

683
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,350
<20-23,RYAN>可以让男人更受女人关注  而不是相反
<20-23,RYAN>gets them more attention from women, not less.

684
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,840
<20-25,RYAN>-所以呢  -所以你把它戴上
<20-25,RYAN>- So? - So wear the ring.

685
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,960
<20-26,RYAN>我想看看女人会不会继续跟你调情
<20-26,RYAN>I want to see if women still flirt with you

686
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,360
<20-26,RYAN>同时无视我
<20-26,RYAN>and ignore me.

687
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,480
<20-27,ESPOSITO>那你不希望卡塞尔来的原因是
<20-27,ESPOSITO>So you didn't want Castle to come because...

688
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,290
<20-28,RYAN_ESPOSITO>所有的女人都会和他调情
<20-28,RYAN_ESPOSITO>All the women would flirt with him.

689
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,530
<20-29,RYAN>我想知道是不是只是婚戒的原因
<20-29,RYAN>I want to know if it's just the ring

690
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,140
<20-29,RYAN>让女人们都敬而远之
<20-29,RYAN>that's repelling members of the fairer sex.

691
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,870
<20-30,ESPOSITO>和婚戒无关  老兄  是你自身原因
<20-30,ESPOSITO>It's not the ring, bro. It's you.

692
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,590
<20-31,ESPOSITO>当你结婚了一阵子
<20-31,ESPOSITO>See, once you've been married for a little while

693
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,100
<20-31,ESPOSITO>你会感到一丝乏味和不满
<20-31,ESPOSITO>and you're feeling a little bored and unsatisfied,

694
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,720
<20-31,ESPOSITO>婚戒会让你得到女人们的爱慕
<20-31,ESPOSITO>The ring will get you love from the ladies.

695
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
<20-31,ESPOSITO>她们想让你脱离苦海
<20-31,ESPOSITO>They'll want to take you away from all that

696
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,430
<20-31,ESPOSITO>好让你娶她们  然后再一起享受乏味和不满
<20-31,ESPOSITO>so that you can be bored and unsatisfied with them.

697
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,740
<20-32,RYAN>那现在为何不是这样
<20-32,RYAN>Why not now?

698
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,110
<20-33,ESPOSITO>因为现在你沉浸在和妻子
<20-33,ESPOSITO>Cause now you're all blissfully happy

699
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,810
<20-33,ESPOSITO>以及新婚的幸福中
<20-33,ESPOSITO>with your wife and whatnot.

700
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,020
<20-33,ESPOSITO>你全身散发着蜜月期的臭味
<20-33,ESPOSITO>You have the stink of honeymoon phase all over you.

701
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,930
<20-33,ESPOSITO>没有哪个女人想接近的
<20-33,ESPOSITO>No woman wants to be around that.

702
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,380
<20-34,RYAN>会持续多久呢
<20-34,RYAN>How long does it last?

703
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,530
<20-35,ESPOSITO>这说不准
<20-35,ESPOSITO>Well, it's hard to say.

704
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,290
<20-35,ESPOSITO>但根据对你和珍妮的了解
<20-35,ESPOSITO>But knowing you and Jenny,

705
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,710
<20-35,ESPOSITO>也许是一辈子吧
<20-35,ESPOSITO>probably forever.

706
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,190
<21-1,CHANTAL>芭比这人呐
<21-1,CHANTAL>Oh, yeah, Barbie.

707
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,330
<21-1,CHANTAL>她成天梦想成为百老汇的舞蹈演员
<21-1,CHANTAL>All she wanted was to be a dancer on Broadway.

708
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,210
<21-2,RYAN>她以前经常把这挂在嘴边吗
<21-2,RYAN>She used to talk about it a lot, huh?

709
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,290
<21-3,CHANTAL>可不止呢
<21-3,CHANTAL>More than that.

710
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,960
<21-3,CHANTAL>她去美容了  换了发型
<21-3,CHANTAL>She got a makeover, changed her hair,

711
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,220
<21-3,CHANTAL>两年前又给鼻子做了整形
<21-3,CHANTAL>and then two years ago, she got her nose done

712
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,370
<21-3,CHANTAL>其实她鼻子原本就很好
<21-3,CHANTAL>even though her nose looked fine before.

713
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,410
<21-4,ESPOSITO>当时芭芭拉有没有和任何人有过纠纷
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Back in the day, did Barbra have trouble with anybody,

714
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,550
<21-4,ESPOSITO>比如顾客或者男友
<21-4,ESPOSITO>say a customer, maybe a boyfriend?

715
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,620
<21-5,CHANTAL>男友  是有的  杰森
<21-5,CHANTAL>Boyfriend, yeah. Jason.

716
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,480
<21-6,ESPOSITO>是他吗
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Could this be him?

717
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
<21-6,ESPOSITO>就是他
<21-6,ESPOSITO>That's him.

718
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,400
<21-7,CHANTAL>杰森·巴格维尔
<21-7,CHANTAL>Jason Bagwell.

719
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,940
<21-8,RYAN>你知道我们如何能找到杰森吗
<21-8,RYAN>Do you know where we can find Jason?

720
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,520
<21-9,CHANTAL>他住在字母城[纽约曼哈顿一街区]
<21-9,CHANTAL>He lived over in Alphabet City.

721
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,660
<21-9,CHANTAL>他总是耍阴谋诡计
<21-9,CHANTAL>He was always running some scam,

722
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,680
<21-9,CHANTAL>从芭芭拉那儿借钱用于新的投资
<21-9,CHANTAL>borrowing money from Barbra for some new business venture

723
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,290
<21-9,CHANTAL>而且从不还钱
<21-9,CHANTAL>and never paying her back.

724
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,100
<21-9,CHANTAL>但是她爱他
<21-9,CHANTAL>But she loved him.

725
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,510
<21-9,CHANTAL>疯狂的爱  懂吗
<21-9,CHANTAL>Crazy love, you know?

726
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,380
<21-10,ESPOSITO>我懂的
<21-10,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah. I do.

<21-12,CHANTAL>If you wanted, you could come back later.

730

<21-12,CHANTAL>我的表演八点开始
<21-12,CHANTAL>My show starts at 8:00.

731
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,330
<21-13,ESPOSITO>我可能会...
<21-13,ESPOSITO>I could probably--

732

<21-14,RYAN>他老婆喊他回家吃饭呢  香檀
<21-14,RYAN>He's gotta get home to the little woman, Shantell,

733

<21-14,RYAN>但我们真心感谢你的时间和合作
<21-14,RYAN>but we do thank you for your time and your cooperation.

734
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,000
<21-15,CHANTAL>好的
<21-15,CHANTAL>All right.

735
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:23,950
<21-16,ESPOSITO>你发什么神经  老兄
<21-16,ESPOSITO>What's wrong with you, man?

736
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,310
<21-16,ESPOSITO>你为什么要坏了我的好事
<21-16,ESPOSITO>Why you gotta throw salt in my game like that?

737
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,340
<21-17,RYAN>你现在不能勾搭女人
<21-17,RYAN>You can't pick up on honeys

738
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,550
<21-17,RYAN>你会玷污手上戴的婚戒
<21-17,RYAN>while wearing the eternal symbol

739
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,320
<21-17,RYAN>它可是象征着我对珍妮永恒的爱与承诺
<21-17,RYAN>of my love and commitment to Jenny.

740
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,380
<21-17,RYAN>-我是不是大声说出来了  -是的
<21-17,RYAN>- Did I just say that out loud? - Mm-hmm.

741
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,290
<21-19,RYAN>怪不得女人们不和我调情
<21-19,RYAN>No wonder women won't flirt with me.

742
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,490
<21-19,RYAN>因为她们清楚自己不可能勾引到
<21-19,RYAN>I'm a lost cause,

743
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,480
<21-19,RYAN>一个深爱着自己妻子的男人
<21-19,RYAN>a man in love with his wife.

744
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,320
<21-20,ESPOSITO>知足吧  老兄
<21-20,ESPOSITO>Enjoy it, my friend.

745
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,670
<21-20,ESPOSITO>很多男人都羡慕你呢
<21-20,ESPOSITO>A lot of men would switch places with you.

746
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,940
<21-20,ESPOSITO>当然我除外  别的男人
<21-20,ESPOSITO>Not me. Mnh-mnh. Other men.

747
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,750
<21-20,ESPOSITO>那些寂寞单身男
<21-20,ESPOSITO>Guys. Unhappy single guys.

748
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,100
<21-21,RYAN>是啊  把婚戒还我
<21-21,RYAN>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me my ring back,

749
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,580
<21-21,RYAN>然后你可以去问香檀的手机号
<21-21,RYAN>and you can go get Shantell's phone number.

750
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,790
<21-21,RYAN>下一个轮到你了
<21-21,RYAN>...You're next up.

753
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,720
<21-24,ESPOSITO>卡住了
<21-24,ESPOSITO>It's stuck.

754
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,180
<22-1,CASTLE>伙计们正在找芭芭拉的前男友
<22-1,CASTLE>The guys are out picking up Barbra's ex-boyfriend.

755
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,840
<22-1,CASTLE>我正好利用这段时间来跟进
<22-1,CASTLE>I thought I'd use the time to follow up

756
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,390
<22-1,CASTLE>他们在夜总会得到的情报
<22-1,CASTLE>on what they learned at the club.

757
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,090
<22-1,CASTLE>首先芭芭拉·兰戴尔
<22-1,CASTLE>Starting with the fact that Barbra Landau

758
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,850
<22-1,CASTLE>确实做了整容手术
<22-1,CASTLE>did get plastic surgery.

759
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,690
<22-1,CASTLE>这是她在车管局登记的旧照片
<22-1,CASTLE>Here is her old D.M.V. Photo.

760
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,260
<22-2,BECKETT>-她很漂亮  -是的
<22-2,BECKETT>- She's a pretty girl. - Exactly.

761
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,350
<22-3,CASTLE>整容没有让她变得更漂亮
<22-3,CASTLE>Plastic surgery didn't make her look more beautiful.

762
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,830
<22-3,CASTLE>只是让她变得更像奥黛特·莫顿
<22-3,CASTLE>It just made her look more like Odette Morton.

763
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,370
<22-3,CASTLE>还记得她的会计塞缪尔·林奇伯格告诉你的话吗
<22-3,CASTLE>You remember her accountant Samuel Lynchberg told you

764
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,620
<22-3,CASTLE>奥黛特为她朋友的鼻部整形买单
<22-3,CASTLE>that Odette paid for her friend's nose job?

765
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,260
<22-4,BECKETT>你难道认为芭芭拉就是那个朋友
<22-4,BECKETT>And you think Barbra is that friend?

766
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,520
<22-4,BECKETT>你认为她们互相认识
<22-4,BECKETT>You think they knew each other?

767
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,150
<22-5,CASTLE>我确定
<22-5,CASTLE>I know it.

768
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,440
<22-5,CASTLE>林奇伯格的助手证实了这点
<22-5,CASTLE>Lynchberg's assistant confirmed it.

769
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,210
<22-5,CASTLE>奥黛特为芭芭拉的整容和开销买单
<22-5,CASTLE>Odette paid for Barbra's surgery plus expenses.

770
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,710
<22-6,BECKETT>我猜你一定对其中的原因有套理论
<22-6,BECKETT>And I'm guessing you have a theory as to why.

771
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
<22-7,CASTLE>你是清楚奥黛特喜欢派对的
<22-7,CASTLE>You know Odette loved to party.

772
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,230
<22-7,CASTLE>从我个人经历来看
<22-7,CASTLE>Speaking from personal experience,

773
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,890
<22-7,CASTLE>那种持续的狂欢作乐
<22-7,CASTLE>I can tell you that all that constant carousing

774
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,080
<22-7,CASTLE>是不会没有恶果的
<22-7,CASTLE>does not come without consequences,

775
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,960
<22-7,CASTLE>比如拘捕  罚义务社区服务之类的
<22-7,CASTLE>Like arrests, community service hours,

776
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,490
<22-7,CASTLE>或在某个陌生旅馆房间醒来
<22-7,CASTLE>waking up in a strange hotel room

777
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,090
<22-7,CASTLE>头上还套着女孩的内裤  那...
<22-7,CASTLE>with some girl's panties on your head. That's...

778
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,070
<22-7,CASTLE>当我没说过
<22-7,CASTLE>Forget that part.

779
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,190
<22-7,CASTLE>这就是奥黛特在社区服务时拍的照片
<22-7,CASTLE>Here is Odette doing her community service hours

780
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,530
<22-7,CASTLE>是惩罚她在2010年第二次酒后驾车
<22-7,CASTLE>for her second D.U.I. in 2010.

781
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,380
<22-7,CASTLE>这是奥黛特和朋友参加一个新娘婚前派对的照片
<22-7,CASTLE>Here's Odette at a bridal shower with friends.

782
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:02,950
<22-8,BECKETT>那又如何
<22-8,BECKETT>So?

783
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,210
<22-9,CASTLE>根据时间标识
<22-9,CASTLE>So according to the time stamps,

784
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,680
<22-9,CASTLE>这两张照片是同一天拍下的
<22-9,CASTLE>these photos were taken on the same day

785
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
<22-9,CASTLE>相隔20分钟不到
<22-9,CASTLE>within 20 minutes of each other.

786
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,220
<22-10,BECKETT>就是说在救济厨房的其实是芭芭拉
<22-10,BECKETT>So it was really Barbra at the soup kitchen.

787
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,590
<22-11,CASTLE>奥黛特犯了罪
<22-11,CASTLE>Odette would do the crime,

788
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,630
<22-11,CASTLE>却不想去做社区义务劳动
<22-11,CASTLE>but she didn't want to do the time.

789
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,860
<22-11,CASTLE>所以她让假冒的自己去帮她做苦活
<22-11,CASTLE>So she created a faux-dette to do her dirty work for her.

790
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,280
<22-11,CASTLE>估计给了不少报酬
<22-11,CASTLE>A job that I bet paid very well.

791
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,860
<22-11,CASTLE>也许在城镇的某个疯狂的夜晚
<22-11,CASTLE>Maybe a wild night on the town

792
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,490
<22-11,CASTLE>奥黛特来到了脱衣舞夜总会
<22-11,CASTLE>Brings Odette to the strip club,

793
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,310
<22-11,CASTLE>在那儿她见到了芭芭拉
<22-11,CASTLE>where she sees Barbra--

794
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,590
<22-11,CASTLE>见到了芭芭拉的"一切"
<22-11,CASTLE>all of Barbra--

795
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,780
<22-12,BECKETT>而她意识到
<22-12,BECKETT>and she realizes,

796
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,920
<22-12,BECKETT>只要花点心思
<22-12,BECKETT>with a little work,

797
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,590
<22-11,CASTLE>芭芭拉能成为她完美的分身
<22-11,CASTLE>Barbra could be the perfect double for her,

798
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,120
<22-11,CASTLE>去做那些
<22-11,CASTLE>doing all the unpleasant jobs

799
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,380
<22-11,CASTLE>奥黛特懒的去做的差事
<22-11,CASTLE>that Odette simply couldn't be bothered to do--

800
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,340
<22-11,CASTLE>社区服务  药检
<22-11,CASTLE>community service hours, drug tests--

801
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,380
<22-12,BECKETT>再稍加训练和一点整容手术
<22-12,BECKETT>And with a little training and some surgical tweaks,

802
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,750
<22-12,BECKETT>芭芭拉还能做更多
<22-12,BECKETT>Barbra could do even more,

803
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,620
<22-12,BECKETT>比如和奥黛特的经理人开会
<22-12,BECKETT>like meetings with Odette's business manager

804
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,860
<22-12,BECKETT>或是玛格丽特姨妈的无聊午宴
<22-12,BECKETT>or boring luncheons with her aunt Margaret.

805
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,240
<22-13,CASTLE>奥黛特的小圈子里没有人知道这诡计
<22-13,CASTLE>Nobody in Odette's inner circle could've known about the ruse,

806
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,530
<22-13,CASTLE>所以当火车失事时
<22-13,CASTLE>so that when the train crashed,

807
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,610
<22-13,CASTLE>芭芭拉看到了从配角成为主角的机会
<22-13,CASTLE>Barbra saw her chance to go from understudy to leading lady,

808
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,260
<22-14,BECKETT>-她抓住了这机会  -这能解释她的转变
<22-14,BECKETT>- and she took it. - Okay, so that explains the transition,

809
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,850
<22-14,BECKETT>但我们还是不知道谁杀了她
<22-14,BECKETT>but we still don't know who killed her.

810
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,190
<22-15,CASTLE>也许我们知道
<22-15,CASTLE>Maybe we do.

811
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,180
<22-15,CASTLE>肯定是某个看到电视后
<22-15,CASTLE>It would have to be someone that knew

812
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,450
<22-15,CASTLE>发现其实奥黛特就是芭芭拉的人
<22-15,CASTLE>Odette was actually Barbra when he saw her on tv,

813
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,630
<22-15,CASTLE>某个想要从
<22-15,CASTLE>someone who was looking

814
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,680
<22-15,CASTLE>她的新生活中捞好处的人
<22-15,CASTLE>to cash in on her new life...

815
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,110
<22-16,BECKETT>就像芭芭拉的男朋友杰森
<22-16,BECKETT>Someone like Barbra's boyfriend Jason.

816
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,570
<22-17,JASON>我是说真的  这太疯狂了  我没有杀人
<22-17,JASON>I'm telling you, this is crazy. I didn't kill anybody.

817
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,120
<23-1,BECKETT>我认为事情的经过是这样的
<23-1,BECKETT>Here's what I think happened--

818
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,280
<23-1,BECKETT>你意识到芭芭拉没有
<23-1,BECKETT>you realized that Barbra didn't die

819
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,820
<23-1,BECKETT>在火车意外中死去
<23-1,BECKETT>in that train accident.

820
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,930
<23-1,BECKETT>她还活着
<23-1,BECKETT>She was alive.

821
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,250
<23-2,CASTLE>而且变成了奥黛特·莫顿  这意味着她很富有
<23-2,CASTLE>And living as Odette Morton, which meant she was very rich.

822
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,700
<23-3,BECKETT>你知道她的秘密  而你也想变富
<23-3,BECKETT>You knew her secret, and you wanted to be rich, too.

823
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,600
<23-4,CASTLE>但是芭芭拉不是那种
<23-4,CASTLE>But Barbra wasn't the kind of girl

824
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,980
<23-4,CASTLE>好不容易攀上枝头
<23-4,CASTLE>to claw her way into the good life

825
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,270
<23-4,CASTLE>然后被你这种人占便宜的女孩
<23-4,CASTLE>and then be taken advantage of by the likes of you.

826
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,200
<23-5,BECKETT>她拒绝了你  所以你开枪杀了她
<23-5,BECKETT>She rejected you, and so you shot her.

827
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,920
<23-6,JASON>看到没  这就是我什么都没说的原因
<23-6,JASON>See, this--this is why I didn't come forward.

828
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,370
<23-6,JASON>我知道你们会怀疑我
<23-6,JASON>I knew you'd suspect me.

829
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,360
<23-7,BECKETT>我们怀疑有动机的人  杰森
<23-7,BECKETT>We suspect people with motive, Jason.

830
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,770
<23-8,JASON>你们搞错了
<23-8,JASON>You've got it wrong.

831
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,510
<23-8,JASON>是芭芭拉来找的我
<23-8,JASON>Barbra came to me.

832
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,230
<23-8,JASON>两个礼拜前  她出现在我门前
<23-8,JASON>Two weeks ago, she showed up on my doorstep

833
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,490
<23-8,JASON>把整个故事告诉了我
<23-8,JASON>and told me the whole story.

834
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,240
<23-9,BECKETT>芭芭拉拥有所有她想要的一切
<23-9,BECKETT>Barbra had everything she could want--

835
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,910
<23-9,BECKETT>一个完美的生活
<23-9,BECKETT>a perfect life.

836
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,380
<23-9,BECKETT>她为什么会冒险联系你呢
<23-9,BECKETT>Why would she risk it all by getting in touch with you?

837
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,850
<23-10,JASON>因为她想我了
<23-10,JASON>Because she missed me.

838
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,160
<23-11,JASON>而且奥黛特的生活并不像芭芭拉
<23-11,JASON>And Odette's life wasn't as perfect

839
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,350
<23-11,JASON>想的那么完美
<23-11,JASON>as Barbra thought.

840
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,530
<23-11,JASON>芭芭拉很孤独
<23-11,JASON>Barbra was lonely,

841
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,760
<23-11,JASON>她想跟我重归于好
<23-11,JASON>and she wanted to get back together.

842
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,950
<23-11,JASON>她告诉我她发现了一些关于奥黛特的事情
<23-11,JASON>She told me she had found out some stuff about Odette,

843
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,990
<23-11,JASON>她过去的什么秘密
<23-11,JASON>um, secrets from her past.

844
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,630
<23-12,BECKETT>-什么秘密  -我不知道
<23-12,BECKETT>- What kind of secrets? - I don't know.

845
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,370
<23-13,JASON>但是她说  如果有人发现了
<23-13,JASON>But she said, if anyone found out,

846
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,200
<23-13,JASON>一切都会被毁了
<23-13,JASON>it would all be over for her.

847
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,760
<23-14,CASTLE>你觉得她是因为这个秘密被杀的吗
<23-14,CASTLE>You think this secret got her killed?

848
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,260
<23-15,JASON>她说她可以利用这个秘密
<23-15,JASON>She said she could use it to her advantage.

849
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,040
<23-15,JASON>她只是还需要一些信息
<23-15,JASON>She just needed more information.

850
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,960
<23-15,JASON>能够作为筹码
<23-15,JASON>Information was-- was leverage,

851
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,510
<23-15,JASON>那信息可以保护她
<23-15,JASON>it would protect her,

852
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,380
<23-15,JASON>但是她必须要快点行动
<23-15,JASON>but she had to move fast.

853
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,130
<23-16,BECKETT>但她还是不够快
<23-16,BECKETT>And she didn't move fast enough.

854
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,400
<23-17,JASON>芭芭拉从小一直跳舞跳到大
<23-17,JASON>Barbra had been dancing since she was a little kid,

855
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,030
<23-17,JASON>她的梦想就是成为百老汇的明星
<23-17,JASON>and all she ever wanted was to be a star on Broadway.

856
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,960
<23-17,JASON>她就要成功了
<23-17,JASON>And she was so close.

857
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,880
<23-18,CASTLE>所以不是她自己的过去
<23-18,CASTLE>So it wasn't something from her own past

858
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,390
<23-18,CASTLE>使得芭芭拉被杀的
<23-18,CASTLE>that got Barbra killed.

859
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,730
<23-18,CASTLE>而是奥黛特的
<23-18,CASTLE>It was something from Odette's.

860
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,870
<24-1,BECKETT>在她被害一周前
<24-1,BECKETT>Okay, so a week before her death,

861
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,580
<24-1,BECKETT>芭芭拉假扮的奥黛特  举止古怪
<24-1,BECKETT>Barbra, as Odette, is acting odd,

862
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,900
<24-1,BECKETT>她错过彩排
<24-1,BECKETT>she's missing rehearsals--

863
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,060
<24-2,CASTLE>她找到前男友
<24-2,CASTLE>She seeks out her ex,

864
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,760
<24-2,CASTLE>告诉他奥黛特的完美生活并不完美
<24-2,CASTLE>tells him that Odette's perfect life isn't so perfect

865
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,280
<24-2,CASTLE>而且奥黛特过去的某件事情
<24-2,CASTLE>and that there's something in Odette's past

866
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,130
<24-2,CASTLE>-是个麻烦  -是的
<24-2,CASTLE>- that's a problem. - Right.

867
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,290
<24-3,BECKETT>她需要信息  她去哪了呢
<24-3,BECKETT>So she needs information. So where does she go?

868
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,830
<24-4,CASTLE>苏珊·斯坦纳
<24-4,CASTLE>Suzanne Steiner.

869
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,590
<24-4,CASTLE>还记得吗  被害那天芭芭拉和她一起喝咖啡
<24-4,CASTLE>Remember, Barbra met her for coffee the day she died?

870
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,760
<24-4,CASTLE>她想和苏珊聊聊旧时光
<24-4,CASTLE>She wanted to talk to Suzanne about old times.

871
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,490
<24-4,CASTLE>我不知道我能帮什么忙
<24-4,CASTLE>I'm not sure what help I can be.

872
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,590
<25-1,SUZANNE STEINER>那天奥黛特看上去挺正常的
<25-1,SUZANNE STEINER>Odette seemed fine the day that I saw her.

873
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,350
<25-2,BECKETT>是吗
<25-2,BECKETT>Mm-hmm.

874
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,830
<25-3,SUZANNE>我一直忘记她不是奥黛特
<25-3,SUZANNE>Oh, I keep forgetting that she wasn't Odette.

875
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,930
<25-3,SUZANNE>她们实在是太像了
<25-3,SUZANNE>Oh, the resemblance was remarkable.

876
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,870
<25-4,BECKETT>你说她想要叙旧
<25-4,BECKETT>You said that she wanted to reminisce.

877
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,470
<25-4,BECKETT>你们两个有多亲近
<25-4,BECKETT>How close were the two of you?

878
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,250
<25-5,SUZANNE>我父亲在她祖父家做了
<25-5,SUZANNE>Well, my dad was the butler in her grandfather's home

879
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,800
<25-5,SUZANNE>二十年的管家  所以
<25-5,SUZANNE>for 20 years, so...

880
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,470
<25-5,SUZANNE>我们两个可以说是一起长大的
<25-5,SUZANNE>we practically grew up together.

881
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,900
<25-6,BECKETT>那她想要谈些什么
<25-6,BECKETT>And what did she want to talk about?

882
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,480
<25-7,SUZANNE>她问起了她祖父
<25-7,SUZANNE>Well, she asked about her grandfather.

883
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,560
<25-7,SUZANNE>奥黛特的祖父
<25-7,SUZANNE>Well, Odette's grandfather.

884
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,290
<25-9,SUZANNE>她说起他们以前有多亲近
<25-9,SUZANNE>She talked about how close they had been.

885
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,510
<25-9,SUZANNE>然后还问起他去世的那天
<25-9,SUZANNE>And then she asked about the day that he died.

886
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,330
<25-10,BECKETT>-他是在睡梦中过世的  是不是  -是的
<25-10,BECKETT>- He died in his sleep, didn't he? - Yeah.

887
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,140
<25-11,SUZANNE>是的  他那时已经98岁了
<25-11,SUZANNE>Yeah, he was 98.

888
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,490
<25-11,SUZANNE>很奇怪她会问我
<25-11,SUZANNE>It was odd that she asked,

889
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,670
<25-11,SUZANNE>因为那时候我不在那里
<25-11,SUZANNE>because I wasn't there,

890
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,320
<25-11,SUZANNE>但她在的
<25-11,SUZANNE>But she was--

891
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,650
<25-11,SUZANNE>奥黛特在  还有我父亲
<25-11,SUZANNE>Odette was-- along with my father,

892
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,950
<25-11,SUZANNE>在我提醒了她之后
<25-11,SUZANNE>and when I reminded her of that,

893
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,000
<25-11,SUZANNE>她问起了我父亲
<25-11,SUZANNE>she asked about my dad.

894
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,050
<25-11,SUZANNE>她说她想和他  叙叙旧
<25-11,SUZANNE>She said she wanted to... catch up with him.

895
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,160
<25-12,BECKETT>你知道他们两个联系过了吗
<25-12,BECKETT>Do you know if the two of them ever spoke?

896
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,280
<25-13,SUZANNE>我把他的号码给了她
<25-13,SUZANNE>Well, I gave her his number,

897
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,230
<25-13,SUZANNE>但我不知道发生了什么
<25-13,SUZANNE>but I-I'm not sure what happened.

898
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,010
<26-1,ESPOSITO>不行  还是拿不下来
<26-1,ESPOSITO>Mnh-mnh. It's not coming off.

899
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,990
<26-1,ESPOSITO>像是焊在我手上了一样
<26-1,ESPOSITO>It's like it soldered itself onto my hand.

900
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,290
<26-2,CASTLE>说不定是被邪灵附体了
<26-2,CASTLE>Maybe it's possessed, you know,

901
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,530
<26-2,CASTLE>就像是斯蒂芬·金小说里被诅咒的邪器
<26-2,CASTLE>like some kind of cursed object from a Stephen King story.

902
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,790
<26-3,RYAN>我该怎么跟我老婆说  我没戴结婚戒指
<26-3,RYAN>How can I tell my wife that I'm not wearing my wedding ring

903
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,580
<26-3,RYAN>是因为我把戒指借给埃斯波西托
<26-3,RYAN>because I lent it to Esposito as an experiment

904
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,590
<26-3,RYAN>来看脱衣舞女会不会和我调情
<26-3,RYAN>to see if strippers would flirt with me?

905
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,860
<26-3,RYAN>也许她会觉得挺好笑的
<26-3,RYAN>Maybe she'll see the humor in it.

906
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,000
<26-5,ESPOSITO>-绝对不可能  -你死定了
<26-5,ESPOSITO>- Not a chance. - You're a dead man.

907
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,560
<26-6,BECKETT>好了  查尔斯·卡森
<26-6,BECKETT>So Charles Carson,

908
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,390
<26-6,BECKETT>奥黛特死去祖父的前管家
<26-6,BECKETT>former butler to Odette's late grandfather.

909
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,930
<26-6,BECKETT>没有犯罪记录  但是听好了
<26-6,BECKETT>No record, but get this--

910
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,890
<26-6,BECKETT>他的名字有点耳熟  我就查了
<26-6,BECKETT>his name rang a bell, so I looked up

911
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,830
<26-6,BECKETT>星期三节目录制的宾客名单
<26-6,BECKETT>the guest list from Wednesday's taping,

912
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,360
<26-6,BECKETT>他在上面
<26-6,BECKETT>and he's on it.

913
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,500
<26-6,BECKETT>奥黛特在最后时刻加了一张卡森先生的票
<26-6,BECKETT>Odette called in a last-minute ticket request for Mr Carson.

914
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,550
<26-7,CASTLE>这么说他在节目现场
<26-7,CASTLE>So he was at the show.

915
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,580
<26-8,BECKETT>是的  保安说他是在2点15进场的
<26-8,BECKETT>Yes, security has him going through at 2:15,

916
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,150
<26-8,BECKETT>但在那之后就没有人记得见过他了
<26-8,BECKETT>but after that, no one remembers seeing him.

917
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,220
<26-9,CASTLE>苏珊说冒牌货
<26-9,CASTLE>Okay, so Suzanne said that faux-dette

918
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,510
<26-9,CASTLE>想谈论她祖父去世的那天
<26-9,CASTLE>wanted to talk about the day her grandfather died.

919
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,330
<26-9,CASTLE>如果这就是芭芭拉发现的秘密呢
<26-9,CASTLE>What if this was the secret that Barbra was on to?

920
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,070
<26-9,CASTLE>如果格兰姆·莫顿不是自然死亡
<26-9,CASTLE>What if Graham Morton didn't die of natural causes

921
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,700
<26-9,CASTLE>而她认为这个查尔斯·卡森
<26-9,CASTLE>and she felt somehow Charles Carson here

922
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,020
<27-10,CASTLE>与此事有关呢
<27-10,CASTLE>had something to do with it?

923
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,050
<26-10,BECKETT>我们得去看看格兰姆·莫顿的验尸报告
<26-10,BECKETT>We need to see Graham Morton's autopsy report.

924
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,520
<27-1,ALEXIS>根据我对验尸报告的研究
<27-1,ALEXIS>Based on my reading of the coroner's report,

925
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,330
<27-1,ALEXIS>我能看出为什么格兰姆·莫顿会被判为自然死亡
<27-1,ALEXIS>I can see why Graham Morton's death was ruled natural causes.

926
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,140
<27-2,CASTLE>然而
<27-2,CASTLE>However --

927
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,790
<27-2,CASTLE>转折来了
<27-2,CASTLE>Ooh. There's a however.

928
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,250
<27-3,LANIE>非常大的转折  说吧
<27-3,LANIE>A very big however. Tell 'em.

929
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,540
<27-4,ALEXIS>有些异常之处让我觉得可疑
<27-4,ALEXIS>There were some anomalies I found suspicious.

930
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,350
<27-4,ALEXIS>莫顿先生的双眼都出现了淤点
<27-4,ALEXIS>Evidence of petechiae in both eyes,

931
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,640
<27-4,ALEXIS>他的鼻梁右侧还有近期造成的淤青
<27-4,ALEXIS>fresh bruising on the right side of Mr. Morton's nose,

932
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,630
<27-4,ALEXIS>而这一切可能是  比如说
<27-4,ALEXIS>which could have happened if, say,

933
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,620
<27-4,ALEXIS>有人用枕头捂住他的脸造成的
<27-4,ALEXIS>someone was holding a pillow over his face.

934
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,890
<27-4,ALEXIS>总之言之  有充分的证据表明
<27-4,ALEXIS>All in all, I think there's ample evidence

935
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,520
<27-4,ALEXIS>莫顿先生是被谋杀的
<27-4,ALEXIS>that Mr. Morton was murdered.

936
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,070
<27-5,CASTLE>充分的证据
<27-5,CASTLE>Ample.

937
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
<27-6,CASTLE>是谋杀
<27-6,CASTLE>Murdered.

938
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,690
<27-6,CASTLE>我太为你骄傲了
<27-6,CASTLE>I am just so proud.

939
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,170
<27-7,ALEXIS>-老爸  注意公私分明  -好吧
<27-7,ALEXIS>- Dad, work. Boundaries.  - Right.

940
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,930
<27-8,CASTLE>还有件事  我要求对方把档案发来时
<27-8,CASTLE>One more thing. When I requested the file be sent over,

941
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,590
<27-9,LANIE>职员告诉我
<27-9,LANIE>the clerk told me

942
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,290
<27-9,LANIE>我是本周第二个要求看这个的人
<27-9,LANIE>that I was the second person this week to ask for it.

943
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,980
<27-9,LANIE>奥黛特·莫顿周二也去过那里
<27-9,LANIE>Odette Morton was there on Tuesday.

944
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,280
<27-10,CASTLE>这么说芭芭拉发现奥黛特的祖父是被谋杀的
<27-10,CASTLE>So Barbra realized Odette's grandfather was murdered

945
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,560
<27-10,CASTLE>她肯定也想到管家卡森
<27-10,CASTLE>and must have thought Carson the butler

946
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,400
<27-10,CASTLE>跟这件事脱不了干系
<27-10,CASTLE>had something to do with it.

947
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,260
<27-11,BECKETT>而当卡森发现
<27-11,BECKETT>And then when Carson figured out

948
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,400
<27-11,BECKETT>芭芭拉知道得太多了
<27-11,BECKETT>that Barbra knew too much,

949
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,410
<27-11,BECKETT>就把她给杀了
<27-11,BECKETT>he killed her.

950
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,850
<27-11,BECKETT>咱们明天一早就得把他叫来问话
<27-11,BECKETT>We're gonna bring him in first thing in the morning.

951
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,960
<27-12,CASTLE>还要以双重谋杀罪逮捕他
<27-12,CASTLE>And arrest him for a double murder.

952
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,710
<28-1,CASTLE>早上好
<28-1,CASTLE>Good morning.

953
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,460
<28-2,MARTHA>我可一点都不好
<28-2,MARTHA>Speak for yourself.

954
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,590
<28-2,MARTHA>理查德  我这次真是搞砸了
<28-2,MARTHA>Oh, Richard. I really messed up.

955
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,050
<28-2,MARTHA>我就是为了逞一时只气
<28-2,MARTHA>I just let my ego get the better of me,

956
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,210
<28-2,MARTHA>这下乌娜·马可尼绝不会赞扬我的学校了
<28-2,MARTHA>now Oona Marconi is never gonna endorse my school.

957
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,590
<28-2,MARTHA>她也行还会为泄恨写些负面报道
<28-2,MARTHA>She'll probably write something negative just out of spite.

958
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,720
<28-3,CASTLE>你还是有机会扭转乾坤的
<28-3,CASTLE>Well, there is a chance you can still turn this around.

959
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,550
<28-3,CASTLE>但问题是你愿意向一个
<28-3,CASTLE>But are you willing to apologize to someone

960
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,730
<28-3,CASTLE>如此过分的人道歉吗
<28-3,CASTLE>who doesn't really deserve it?

961
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,150
<28-4,MARTHA>亲爱的  我觉得这现在根本就不是
<28-4,MARTHA>Darling, I don't think a simple apology

962
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,970
<28-4,MARTHA>道个歉就能解决的问题了
<28-4,MARTHA>is gonna get me out of this.

963
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,090
<28-5,CASTLE>那我就只好引用唐·维托·柯里昂的一句名言了
<28-5,CASTLE>Then in the wise words of Don Vito Corleone...

965
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,460
<28-5,CASTLE>你得给她提出一个
<28-5,CASTLE>you need to make her an offer

966
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,290
<28-5,CASTLE>她无法拒绝的提议
<28-5,CASTLE>she can't refuse.

967
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,950
<28-5,CASTLE>如果我能
<28-5,CASTLE>And if there's anything --

968
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,710
<28-5,CASTLE>如果我能帮上忙的话
<28-5,CASTLE>if there's anything I can do to help,

969
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,690
<28-5,CASTLE>-告诉我一声  -我会的
<28-5,CASTLE>- you let me know.  - I will.

970
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,000
<28-6,MARTHA>我会的
<28-6,MARTHA>I will.

971
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:56,230
<29-1,BECKETT>卡森先生  你为格兰姆·莫顿工作了二十五余年
<29-1,BECKETT>Mr. Carson, you worked for Graham Morton for over 25 years.

972
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,790
<29-1,BECKETT>据我了解  你跟他的孙子和孙女关系很好
<29-1,BECKETT>I understand that you were very close with his grandkids.

973
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,470
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>我们关系的确很亲近
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>Well, as -- as close as one could be

974
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,810
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>但我们仍是
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>while still maintaining

975
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>雇主与雇员的关系
<29-2,CHARLES CARSON>the employer-servant relationship.

976
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,910
<29-3,CASTLE>所以当死者打电话邀请你
<29-3,CASTLE>So when the victim called you and invited you

977
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,520
<29-3,CASTLE>去参加周三晚上的《热舞之夜》的录制
<29-3,CASTLE>to the "Night of Dance" taping on Wednesday,

978
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,110
<29-3,CASTLE>-你欣然同意了  -我乐意至极
<29-3,CASTLE>- you said yes.  - I was delighted.

979
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,190
<29-4,CHARLES>她让我在录制结束后跟她聚聚
<29-4,CHARLES>She asked me to meet her afterwards

980
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,670
<29-4,CHARLES>她说她有个问题要问我
<29-4,CHARLES>and said that she had a question for me,

981
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,770
<29-4,CHARLES>但正如你们所知的  录制取消了
<29-4,CHARLES>but of course, as you know, they canceled the show,

982
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,670
<29-4,CHARLES>而我直到第二天才知道究竟发生了什么
<29-4,CHARLES>and I didn't find out until the next day what had happened.

983
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,420
<29-4,CHARLES>我完全不知道
<29-4,CHARLES>I had no idea

984
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,680
<29-4,CHARLES>那个女孩根本就不是奥黛特
<29-4,CHARLES>that that girl wasn't Odette

985
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,850
<29-4,CHARLES>我也不知道她要找我谈些什么
<29-4,CHARLES>and no idea why she wanted to talk to me.

986
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,620
<29-5,BECKETT>她想找你谈格兰姆·莫顿去世那天的事
<29-5,BECKETT>She wanted to talk to you about the day that Graham Morton died.

987
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,450
<29-6,CHARLES>她为什么会对这个感兴趣
<29-6,CHARLES>Why would she care about that?

988
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,530
<29-7,CASTLE>她似乎找到了一些证据表明
<29-7,CASTLE>It seems she had some evidence

989
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,330
<29-7,CASTLE>莫顿先生不是自然死亡的
<29-7,CASTLE>that Mr. Morton didn't die of natural causes.

990
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,370
<29-8,CHARLES>你把我搞糊涂了  你是说他是被谋杀的吗
<29-8,CHARLES>I don't understand. Are you saying that he was murdered?

991
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,870
<29-9,BECKETT>莫顿先生去世当天你也在他家  对吧
<29-9,BECKETT>You were at the house that day, weren't you?

992
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,260
<29-10,CHARLES>上帝啊  你不会认为我
<29-10,CHARLES>Oh, good lord. You don't think that I had --

993
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,200
<29-11,BECKETT>你是和他关系最近的人
<29-11,BECKETT>You were the person closest to him.

994
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,950
<29-11,BECKETT>你有充足的机会
<29-11,BECKETT>You had ample opportunity.

995
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,020
<29-12,CASTLE>我们看过遗嘱了
<29-12,CASTLE>We've seen the will.

996
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,900
<29-12,CASTLE>他给你留下了很大一笔遗产
<29-12,CASTLE>He left you a generous bequest.

997
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,190
<29-13,CHARLES>我是绝对不会伤害莫顿先生的
<29-13,CHARLES>I would never have hurt Mr. Morton.

998
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,180
<29-13,CHARLES>但是那个女人
<29-13,CHARLES>But that woman --

999
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,470
<29-13,CHARLES>那个假扮成奥黛特的女人
<29-13,CHARLES>the woman who pretended to be Odette --

1000
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,990
<29-13,CHARLES>她可能猜中了他的死因
<29-13,CHARLES>she might be right about his death.

1001
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,970
<29-13,CHARLES>其实  有可能
<29-13,CHARLES>In fact, it's possible

1002
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,950
<29-13,CHARLES>她真认为我对此知情
<29-13,CHARLES>that she believed that I knew something.

1003
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,290
<29-13,CHARLES>告诉我
<29-13,CHARLES>Tell me,

1004
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,520
<29-13,CHARLES>莫顿先生是怎么死的
<29-13,CHARLES>how did Mr. Morton die?

1005
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,650
<29-13,CHARLES>他是被人闷死的吗
<29-13,CHARLES>Was he smothered?

1006
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,890
<29-14,BECKETT>你为什么这么问
<29-14,BECKETT>Why would you ask that?

1007
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,650
<29-15,CHARLES>他去世的那个月  家里的气氛一直很紧张
<29-15,CHARLES>The month he died, there was tension in the household.

1008
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,460
<29-15,CHARLES>莫顿先生不喜欢
<29-15,CHARLES>Odette was seeing someone

1009
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,840
<29-15,CHARLES>奥黛特当时的男朋友
<29-15,CHARLES>of whom Mr. Morton did not approve.

1010
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,610
<29-16,BECKETT>你知道是谁吗
<29-16,BECKETT>Do you know who?

1011
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,600
<29-17,CHARLES>不知道  但是他命令她跟那个人分手
<29-17,CHARLES>No, but he ordered her to break it off,

1012
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,040
<29-17,CHARLES>当然了  那天奥黛特哭得稀里哗啦
<29-17,CHARLES>and of course, that day Odette was crying,

1013
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
<29-17,CHARLES>几乎整个早上都躲在房间里哭
<29-17,CHARLES>she spent most of the morning in her room.

1014
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
<29-17,CHARLES>一点左右时  莫顿先生说他想睡一会儿
<29-17,CHARLES>At about 1:00, Mr. Morton said that he wanted to take a nap,

1015
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,320
<29-17,CHARLES>于是我把床上的枕头都拿走了
<29-17,CHARLES>so I cleared the bed of all the pillows.

1016
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,520
<29-17,CHARLES>他喜欢平躺着睡
<29-17,CHARLES>He preferred a-a flat surface.

1017
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,430
<29-17,CHARLES>过了一会儿以后
<29-17,CHARLES>Now a few moments later,

1018
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,170
<29-17,CHARLES>楼下厨房出了点乱子
<29-17,CHARLES>there was a commotion down in the kitchen.

1019
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,560
<29-17,CHARLES>奥黛特把三明治放在烤箱里烤太久了
<29-17,CHARLES>Odette had put a sandwich in the toaster oven too long,

1020
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,610
<29-17,CHARLES>结果发生了小火灾
<29-17,CHARLES>and it had caused a small fire.

1021
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,500
<29-17,CHARLES>我们把火扑灭了
<29-17,CHARLES>We put it out,

1022
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,790
<29-17,CHARLES>然后我去楼上查看莫顿先生
<29-17,CHARLES>and then I went back upstairs to check on Mr. Morton,

1023
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,560
<29-17,CHARLES>他已经死了
<29-17,CHARLES>and he was dead.

1024
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,600
<29-17,CHARLES>那时我就注意到了
<29-17,CHARLES>And that's when I noticed it.

1025
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,800
<29-18,CASTLE>注意到了什么
<29-18,CASTLE>Noticed what?

1026
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,140
<29-19,CHARLES>床上有个枕头
<29-19,CHARLES>A pillow on the bed.

1027
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,140
<29-19,CHARLES>而我很确定我之前把所有的枕头都拿走了
<29-19,CHARLES>And I was sure that I had taken them all off.

1028
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,780
<29-19,CHARLES>所以我跟奥黛特说了
<29-19,CHARLES>So I told Odette about it,

1029
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,880
<29-19,CHARLES>但是她说肯定是我记错了
<29-19,CHARLES>but she said my mind was playing tricks on me,

1030
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,020
<29-19,CHARLES>我就没再追究
<29-19,CHARLES>so I let it go.

1031
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,650
<29-20,BECKETT>卡森先生  你在厨房的时候
<29-20,BECKETT>Mr. Carson, when you were in the kitchen,

1032
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,930
<29-20,BECKETT>奥黛特是否曾离开过你的视线
<29-20,BECKETT>was there ever a moment that Odette was out of your sight?

1033
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,340
<29-20,BECKETT>没有
<29-20,BECKETT>No.

1034
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,690
<29-21,CHARLES>我知道她是无辜的
<29-21,CHARLES>I-I knew she was innocent.

1035
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,990
<29-21,CHARLES>她不是无辜的
<29-21,CHARLES>She wasn't innocent.

1036
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,070
<29-22,CASTLE>她是为了引开你
<29-22,CASTLE>She was the distraction.

1037
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,170
<29-22,CASTLE>奥黛特把你引到厨房
<29-22,CASTLE>Odette got you down to the kitchen

1038
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,880
<29-22,CASTLE>而她的同伙则借机谋杀了她的祖父
<29-22,CASTLE>while her accomplice went and murdered her grandfather.

1039
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,100
<29-23,BECKETT>而当芭芭拉·兰戴尔搞清了事实真相后
<29-23,BECKETT>And then when Barbra Landau figured out the truth,

1040
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,620
<29-23,BECKETT>那个同伙把她也杀掉了
<29-23,BECKETT>the accomplice murdered her, too.

1041
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,590
<29-23,BECKETT>感谢你能来  林奇伯格先生
<29-23,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lynchberg.

1042
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,540
<30-1,BECKETT>林奇伯格先生
<30-1,BECKETT>Mr. Lynchberg,

1043
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,260
<30-2,CASTLE>作为莫顿家族的财务顾问
<30-2,CASTLE>being the Morton family financial advisor,

1044
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,880
<30-2,CASTLE>你肯定对他们一家人的
<30-2,CASTLE>that must give you pretty good insight

1045
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,060
<30-2,CASTLE>私生活了如指掌吧
<30-2,CASTLE>into their -- their personal lives, right?

1046
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,210
<30-3,LYNCHBERG>知道一个人都把钱花在什么地方
<30-3,LYNCHBERG>Well, looking at what people spend their money on,

1047
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,280
<30-3,LYNCHBERG>的确会让你对这个人有所了解
<30-3,LYNCHBERG>you get to know folks pretty well.

1048
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,720
<30-4,BECKETT>那你有多了解奥黛特呢
<30-4,BECKETT>And how well did you know Odette?

1049
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,700
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>就跟我对其他客户的了解一样
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>As well as any of my clients.

1050
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,420
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>但毕竟我之前多次为她的生活方式说她
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>But given the lectures that I gave her about her lifestyle,

1051
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,440
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>或许更了解她吧
<30-5,LYNCHBERG>maybe more so.

1052
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,230
<30-6,CASTLE>据我们所知  在奥黛特的祖父去世的那段时间
<30-6,CASTLE>We understand, about the time her grandfather died,

1053
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,780
<30-6,CASTLE>她正在跟某个人交往
<30-6,CASTLE>Odette was dating someone,

1054
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,080
<30-6,CASTLE>但她祖父不同意他们在一起
<30-6,CASTLE>someone her grandfather didn't approve of.

1055
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,900
<30-7,LYNCHBERG>这并不奇怪
<30-7,LYNCHBERG>Mm. Well, that's not surprising.

1056
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,670
<30-7,LYNCHBERG>他们经常意见相左
<30-7,LYNCHBERG>The two of them rarely saw eye to eye.

1057
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,470
<30-8,BECKETT>你记得奥黛特的男朋友是谁吗
<30-8,BECKETT>This boyfriend -- do you remember who he was?

1058
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,160
<30-9,LYNCHBERG>不记得  为什么问这个
<30-9,LYNCHBERG>No. Why?

1059
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,710
<30-10,BECKETT>因为我们认为他伙同
<30-10,BECKETT>Well, because we think that he conspired

1060
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,320
<30-10,BECKETT>奥黛特杀死了她的祖父
<30-10,BECKETT>with Odette to kill her grandfather

1061
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
<30-10,BECKETT>而他后来又杀死了芭芭拉
<30-10,BECKETT>and then he killed Barbra

1062
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,550
<30-10,BECKETT>因为她马上就要搞清楚事情的真相了
<30-10,BECKETT>when she was on the verge of figuring it all out.

1063
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,110
<30-11,CASTLE>你确定你不记得了吗
<30-11,CASTLE>You're sure you don't remember?

1064
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:29,740
<30-11,CASTLE>确定
<30-11,CASTLE>Mnh-mnh.

1065
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,370
<30-13,BECKETT>我们跟奥黛特的哥哥通过电话
<30-13,BECKETT>Well, we just spoke with Odette's brother,

1066
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,040
<30-13,BECKETT>他记得
<30-13,BECKETT>and he remembers.

1067
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,490
<30-13,BECKETT>事实上  他记得她的男友是你
<30-13,BECKETT>In fact, he remembers it being you.

1068
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,950
<30-14,BECKETT>他说你们两个想要结婚
<30-14,BECKETT>He said that the two of you wanted to get married,

1069
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:40,980
<30-14,BECKETT>但是奥黛特的祖父威胁说要剥夺她的继承权
<30-14,BECKETT>but Odette's grandfather threatened to cut her off.

1070
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,220
<30-15,CASTLE>奥黛特这样的女孩
<30-15,CASTLE>Now a girl like Odette,

1071
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,700
<30-15,CASTLE>靠着你那可怜的六位数工资
<30-15,CASTLE>she could never be happy living off

1072
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,520
<30-15,CASTLE>她可不会快活
<30-15,CASTLE>a meager 6-figure salary like yours.

1073
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,070
<30-15,CASTLE>她得继承遗产
<30-15,CASTLE>She needed to inherit.

1074
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,730
<30-15,CASTLE>但那老头子一直不死
<30-15,CASTLE>But that old man refused to die.

1075
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,670
<30-16,BECKETT>于是她就说服你
<30-16,BECKETT>So she convinced you

1076
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,960
<30-16,BECKETT>利用她在厨房搞出的乱子
<30-16,BECKETT>to go upstairs and smother him to death with a pillow

1077
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,020
<30-16,BECKETT>上楼用枕头将他闷死
<30-16,BECKETT>while she created a distraction in the kitchen.

1078
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,260
<30-16,BECKETT>问题解决了
<30-16,BECKETT>Problem solved.

1079
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,630
<30-17,CASTLE>只不过她一拿到钱
<30-17,CASTLE>Except once she had her money,

1080
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,960
<30-17,CASTLE>她离开了你  继续她派对动物的生活
<30-17,CASTLE>she left you, went back to her partying lifestyle.

1081
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,770
<30-18,BECKETT>她利用了你  但是你却束手无策
<30-18,BECKETT>She used you, but there wasn't anything you could do about it.

1082
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,090
<30-18,BECKETT>至少在否认谋杀的前提下没有法子
<30-18,BECKETT>At least not without admitting to the murder.

1083
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,110
<30-19,LYNCHBERG>你们无法证明
<30-19,LYNCHBERG>You can't prove that.

1084
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,770
<30-19,LYNCHBERG>他的死被判定是自然死亡
<30-19,LYNCHBERG>His death wasn't even ruled a homicide.

1085
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,070
<30-20,BECKETT>是的  但芭芭拉·兰戴尔是被谋杀的
<30-20,BECKETT>No, but Barbra Landau's was.

1086
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,550
<30-21,BECKETT>警员在你办公室后的垃圾桶里
<30-21,BECKETT>Uniforms found this 9 millimeter

1087
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,840
<30-21,BECKETT>找到了这把9毫米口径手枪
<30-21,BECKETT>in the dumpster behind your offices.

1088
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,910
<30-21,BECKETT>弹道检测相匹配
<30-21,BECKETT>Ballistics match.

1089
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,830
<30-21,BECKETT>杀死芭芭拉·兰戴尔的就是这把枪
<30-21,BECKETT>This is the same gun that was used to kill Barbra Landau.

1090
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,120
<30-21,BECKETT>而且上面
<30-21,BECKETT>And it's got...

1091
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:29,180
<30-21,BECKETT>全是你的指纹
<30-21,BECKETT>your fingerprints all over it.

1092
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,180
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>上个月  她的信用卡账单多得吓人
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>Last month, when her credit card bills were so high,

1093
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,140
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>我以为她又开始吸毒了
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>I thought she was slipping back into her old ways.

1094
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,400
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>我对她说
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>I said to her,

1095
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,580
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>我们做了那些事  得到这笔钱
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>"We didn't risk everything to get this money

1096
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,330
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>不是为了让你毁掉自己
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>so you could let it ruin your life."

1097
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,770
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>她看着我
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>And she looked at me, and...

1098
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,370
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>我看得出
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>I could tell,

1099
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,610
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>她根本就不知道我在说什么
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>she had no idea what I was talking about.

1100
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,920
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>就在那时
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>In that moment,

1101
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,870
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>我知道她不是我的奥黛特
<30-22,LYNCHBERG>I knew that she wasn't my Odette.

1102
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,440
<30-23,CASTLE>也是在那时她知道了你的秘密
<30-23,CASTLE>And that's how she got on to you.

1103
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,090
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>这个芭芭拉跟我说如果我替她保密
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>So this Barbra told me that if I kept her secret,

1104
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,300
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>她也会守口如瓶
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>she would keep mine.

1105
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,720
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>她以为这样我们就扯平了
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>She thought we were even.

1106
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,900
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>她以为她可以就这样变身为奥黛特
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>She thought that she could just take the place of Odette.

1107
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,040
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>要我怎么做
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>I mean, wh-what-- what was I supposed to do,

1108
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,070
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>让这个脱衣舞女住在她家
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>just let some dirty stripper live in her house

1109
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,940
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>穿她的衣服  勒索我吗
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>and wear her clothes and--and blackmail me?

1110
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,640
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>她不配过奥黛特的生活
<30-24,LYNCHBERG>Odette deserved better.

1111
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,460
<31-1,BECKETT>怎么了
<31-1,BECKETT>What's going on?

1112
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,090
<31-2,CASTLE>我就是在想
<31-2,CASTLE>I was just thinking

1113
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:41,060
<31-2,CASTLE>我们靠着梦想维持自己的生活
<31-2,CASTLE>how we rely on dreams to keep us going in life

1114
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,820
<31-2,CASTLE>而当梦想
<31-2,CASTLE>and how sad it is

1115
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,540
<31-2,CASTLE>毁掉我们的生活时  这有多可悲
<31-2,CASTLE>when they become the things that tear us down.

1116
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,840
<31-3,BECKETT>芭芭拉·兰戴尔的经历那是特例
<31-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that might be the case for Barbra Landau,

1117
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,780
<31-3,BECKETT>但并不是每个梦想没实现的人都这样啊
<31-3,BECKETT>but not for everyone with dreams that didn't come true.

1118
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,500
<31-3,BECKETT>拿蕾妮来说吧
<31-3,BECKETT>I mean, take Lanie for instance.

1119
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,380
<31-3,BECKETT>她想成为一个舞者  结果成了医生
<31-3,BECKETT>She wanted to be a dancer. She became a doctor.

1120
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,320
<31-3,BECKETT>一点都不可悲啊
<31-3,BECKETT>That's not so bad, is it?

1121
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,140
<31-4,CASTLE>你呢
<31-4,CASTLE>Hmm. What about you?

1122
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,030
<31-4,CASTLE>我知道你是因为
<31-4,CASTLE>I mean, I know you became a cop

1123
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,950
<31-4,CASTLE>你母亲被谋杀才当警察的
<31-4,CASTLE>because your mother was murdered,

1124
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,770
<31-4,CASTLE>但之前你肯定有别的梦想
<31-4,CASTLE>but there had to be something before that.

1125
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,300
<31-4,CASTLE>小时候的凯特·贝克特长大想做什么
<31-4,CASTLE>What did little Kate Beckett want to be when she grew up?

1126
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,160
<31-5,BECKETT>在斯坦福大学时  我念法律预科
<31-5,BECKETT>At Stanford, I was pre-law.

1127
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,020
<31-6,CASTLE>那么说你的梦想是在最高法院打官司
<31-6,CASTLE>So your dream was to argue a case before the supreme court.

1128
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,360
<31-7,BECKETT>是的  我当时正在努力
<31-7,BECKETT>Mm-hmm. Yep, I was on my way

1129
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,240
<31-7,BECKETT>成为第一位女性首席法官
<31-7,BECKETT>to becoming the first female chief justice.

1130
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,110
<31-7,BECKETT>不赖
<31-7,BECKETT>Not bad.

1131
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:29,340
<32-1,ESPOSITO>拿不下来  你知道吗
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Ah, it won't-- yeah, you know what?

1132
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,250
<32-1,ESPOSITO>我跟脱衣舞女约会要迟到了
<32-1,ESPOSITO>I'm late for my stripper date, man.

1133
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,660
<32-2,RYAN>不行  不行
<32-2,RYAN>Whoa. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

1134
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,240
<32-2,RYAN>我今晚不能不戴戒指回家啊
<32-2,RYAN>I cannot go home again without ring on my finger tonight.

1135
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,770
<32-2,RYAN>我家沙发有个弹簧坏了  我的背...
<32-2,RYAN>Our couch has a loose spring. My back--

1136
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,930
<32-3,BECKETT>你试肥皂了吗
<32-3,BECKETT>Did you try soap?

1137
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,150
<32-4,ESPOSITO>-试了  -那是我们在先试的
<32-4,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. - Yeah, that was, like, the first thing we did.

1138
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,500
<32-5,RYAN>-烹饪油呢  -我没想过用烹饪油
<32-5,RYAN>- Cooking spray? - I didn't think about cooking spray.

1139
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,510
<32-6,CASTLE>上哪找烹饪油去
<32-6,CASTLE>Where am I gonna find cooking spray?

1140
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,330
<32-8,BECKETT>用这个
<32-8,BECKETT>Here.

1141
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,750
<32-9,ESPOSITO>像丝绸一样
<32-9,ESPOSITO>It's like silk.

1142
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,880
<32-10,RYAN>可能会起作用
<32-10,RYAN>That might work.

1143
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:56,190
<32-12,RYAN>我觉得能拿下来了
<32-12,RYAN>Oh, yeah. I think it's coming. Yeah?

1144
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,130
<32-13,ESPOSITO>至少从我手指上拿下来了
<32-13,ESPOSITO>At least it's off my finger.

1145
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,230
<33-1,MARTHA>乌娜  你能来真是太感谢了
<33-1,MARTHA>Oona, thank you so much for stopping by.

<33-2,OONA>to mention your little school.

<33-11,MARTHA>All's well that ends well.

1160
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,580
<33-12,CASTLE>妈  为什么乌娜·马可尼会期待
<33-12,CASTLE>Mother, why would Oona Marconi be looking forward

1161
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,560

<33-13,MARTHA>Well, you did say, if there was any way that you could help--

1163
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,300
<33-14,CASTLE>你应该先跟我打招呼
<33-14,CASTLE>That you should let me know.
