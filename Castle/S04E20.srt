9
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>说真的  肯定发生了什么事
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>I'm telling you, something happened,

10
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,770
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>我们起了变化
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>something changed.

11
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,830
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>最近我们之间一直怪怪的
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>It's been weird between us lately.

12
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,170
<1-2,LANIE PARISH>只是最近吗
<1-2,LANIE PARISH>Lately?

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,670
<1-2,LANIE PARISH>凯特  你们俩都怪了四年了
<1-2,LANIE PARISH>Kate, it's been weird for four years.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,020
<1-3,BECKETT>不  这次不一样
<1-3,BECKETT>No, this is different.

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,600
<1-3,BECKETT>他变了  好像在疏远我
<1-3,BECKETT>He's different. It's like he's pulling away.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,090
<1-4,LANIE>你也不能怪他啊
<1-4,LANIE>Well, can you blame him?

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,590
<1-4,LANIE>没准儿只是等累了
<1-4,LANIE>He's probably tired of waiting.

18
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,380
<1-5,BECKETT>等啥啊
<1-5,BECKETT>Waiting for what?

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,510
<1-5,BECKETT>你觉得呢
<1-5,BECKETT>What do you think?

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,980
<1-6,LANIE>他为你痴狂
<1-6,LANIE>The guy is crazy about you.

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,650
<1-6,LANIE>不管你怎么掩饰  你也迷恋着他
<1-6,LANIE>And despite your little act, you're crazy about him.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,950
<1-6,LANIE>怎么  这难不成还是惊天大秘密啊
<1-6,LANIE>Oh, what, was that supposed to be some big secret?

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,460
<1-6,LANIE>必须的
<1-6,LANIE>Yes.

24
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,090
<1-7,BECKETT>好吧
<1-7,BECKETT>No.

25
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,230
<1-7,BECKETT>你觉得他知道吗
<1-7,BECKETT>Do you think he knows?

26
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,790
<1-8,LANIE>记得他以前什么样儿吗
<1-8,LANIE>You remember how he used to be,

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,310
<1-8,LANIE>左拥右抱的
<1-8,LANIE>girl on either arm?

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,000
<1-8,LANIE>现在是不是看不见他那样儿了
<1-8,LANIE>You really don't see that guy too much anymore.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,640
<1-8,LANIE>你觉得是啥原因呢
<1-8,LANIE>Why do you think that is?

30
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,740
<1-8,LANIE>他在等你
<1-8,LANIE>He's waiting for you.

31
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,560
<1-9,BECKETT>我知道  但是  蕾妮
<1-9,BECKETT>Yeah, but, Lanie--

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,590
<1-10,LANIE>我知道  你有心结没解开
<1-10,LANIE>I know. You're dealing with stuff.

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,790
<1-10,LANIE>但你不让他等你一辈子啊
<1-10,LANIE>But you cannot ask him to wait forever.

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,400
<1-10,LANIE>当然了  除非你不在意他疏远你
<1-10,LANIE>Unless, of course, you're okay with him pulling away.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,340
<1-11,BECKETT>要是我们俩不合拍
<1-11,BECKETT>What if it doesn't work?

36
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,140
<1-11,BECKETT>像你和哈维一样分开了呢
<1-11,BECKETT>What if it ends up like you and Javi?

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,940
<1-12,LANIE>起码我们尝试过了
<1-12,LANIE>Well, at least we gave it a shot.

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,230
<1-12,LANIE>我们俩分手了  那又怎么样
<1-12,LANIE>And so it didn't work out. So what?

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,360
<1-12,LANIE>我们现在都开始新生活了
<1-12,LANIE>Now we can move on,

40
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,830
<1-12,LANIE>除了有时候滚滚床单
<1-12,LANIE>give or take the occasional booty call.

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,140
<1-13,BECKETT>我只是  不想失去现在拥有的一切
<1-13,BECKETT>I just--I don't want to lose what we have, you know?

42
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,700
<1-14,LANIE>得了吧  傻姑娘
<1-14,LANIE>Girl, please.

43
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,940
<1-14,LANIE>你们现在有啥啊
<1-14,LANIE>What exactly do you have, really?

44
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,580
<1-15,BECKETT>友谊啊
<1-15,BECKETT>A friendship.

45
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,930
<1-16,LANIE>错  你我之间是友谊
<1-16,LANIE>No. What you and I have is a friendship.

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,050
<1-16,LANIE>你和卡塞尔处于停滞不前
<1-16,LANIE>What you and Castle have is a holding pattern.

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,630
<1-16,LANIE>激情消退之前你们还能坚持多久
<1-16,LANIE>How long can you circle before the fuel runs out?

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,510
<2-1,LANIE>别以为这事儿就完了  凯特·贝克特
<2-1,LANIE>Don't think you were saved by the bell, Kate Beckett.

50
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,700
<2-1,LANIE>作为朋友我不是会袖手旁观的
<2-1,LANIE>As your friend, I'm not gonna let this drop.

51
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,900
<2-2,BECKETT>那怎么办  向他坦白吗
<2-2,BECKETT>So what, you think I should tell him how I feel?

52
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,630
<2-2,BECKETT>对
<2-2,BECKETT>Yes.

53
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,900
<2-3,LANIE>你天天追捕杀人犯  这也不在话下
<2-3,LANIE>You hunt murderers for a living. You can do this.

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,740
<2-4,BECKETT>好吧
<2-4,BECKETT>Okay. Okay.

55
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,710
<2-4,BECKETT>我只是想找个恰当的时间
<2-4,BECKETT>I just--I-I have to find the right time.

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,620
<2-5,LANIE>现在就是最佳时机
<2-5,LANIE>No time like the present.

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,130
<2-6,LANIE>搞你妹...
<2-6,LANIE>What the...

58
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,990
<2-7,LANIE>转念一想
<2-7,LANIE>On second thought,

59
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,430
<2-7,LANIE>也许你该再等等
<2-7,LANIE>maybe you should wait a bit.

60
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,630
<2-7,LANIE>听到了吗  莱恩叫我呢  先走了
<2-7,LANIE>What's that? Ryan's calling. I gotta go.

61
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,090
<2-8,CASTLE>我一小时以后再打给你
<2-8,CASTLE>I'll call you in about an hour.

62
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,790
<2-9,CASTLE>哈喽啊
<2-9,CASTLE>Hey there.

63
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,230
<2-10,BECKETT>我感觉像在看一集烂透了的《迈阿密风云》
<2-10,BECKETT>I feel like I just walked into a bad episode of "Miami Vice."

64
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,000
<2-11,CASTLE>首先《迈阿密风云》集集精彩
<2-11,CASTLE>Okay, first, there are no bad episodes of "Miami Vice."

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,340
<2-11,CASTLE>其次  被害人是谁
<2-11,CASTLE>Second, who died?

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,740
<2-12,BECKETT>你  瞧你的脸色吧
<2-12,BECKETT>You from the looks of it.

67
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,630
<2-12,BECKETT>像被大卡车碾过一样
<2-12,BECKETT>You look like you just got run over by a truck.

68
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,640
<2-13,CASTLE>是啊  奇遇大卡车
<2-13,CASTLE>Yeah, a truck delivering a shipment of awesome.

69
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,800
<2-13,CASTLE>我就是飞去维加斯度了个周末
<2-13,CASTLE>No, I just flew into Vegas for the weekend.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,820
<2-13,CASTLE>想换点儿景色看看
<2-13,CASTLE>Just needed a little change of scenery.

71
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,960
<2-14,BECKETT>然后在高筹码扑克桌上赢了个金发美女吗
<2-14,BECKETT>And you won the blonde in a high-stakes poker match?

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,590
<2-15,CASTLE>没有  回程的飞机上遇到的
<2-15,CASTLE>No, I met her on the flight back.

73
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,050
<2-16,BECKETT>那你就把车交给她了
<2-16,BECKETT>And you just gave her your car?

74
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,350
<2-17,CASTLE>贾辛达恰好是个值得信赖的人
<2-17,CASTLE>Jacinda happens to be a very trustworthy person.

75
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,070
<2-17,CASTLE>她是头等舱的空姐
<2-17,CASTLE>She's a first-class flight attendant.

76
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,640
<2-17,CASTLE>我又不是把社会保险号给了她
<2-17,CASTLE>It's not like I gave her my social security number.

77
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,890
<2-17,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<2-17,CASTLE>Castle...

78
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,340
<2-18,BECKETT>你还好吗
<2-18,BECKETT>Is everything okay?

79
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,170
<2-19,CASTLE>再好不过了
<2-19,CASTLE>Never better.

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,190
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>被害人叫娜奥米·艾伦  25岁
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Our victim's Naomi Allen, age 25.

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,550
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>绿卡显示她是英国国民
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Her green card indicates that she's a British national.

82
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,340
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>莱恩已经通知了领事馆
<3-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Ryan is notifying the consulate.

83
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,650
<3-2,BECKETT>她的地址写得是苏豪区
<3-2,BECKETT>Her address is in SoHo.

84
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,150
<3-2,BECKETT>大老远的跑这里来干吗呢
<3-2,BECKETT>What was she doing all the way down here?

85
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,950
<3-3,ESPOSITO>谁知道呢  但是她是在遇害前两小时入住的
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Don't know, but she checked in two hours before she was killed.

86
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,660
<3-4,CASTLE>希望他们AA制付的房钱
<3-4,CASTLE>I hope they prorated the room.

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,250
<3-5,ESPOSITO>好消息是我们有位目击证人
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Good news is, we have a witness.

88
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,400
<3-5,ESPOSITO>发现尸体的女仆看到一个男人逃走了
<3-5,ESPOSITO>The maid who discovered the body saw a guy run out.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
<3-6,BECKETT>她看清楚脸了吗
<3-6,BECKETT>Did the maid get a good look?

90
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,910
<3-7,ESPOSITO>她和画师在一起
<3-7,ESPOSITO>She's with the sketch artist now.

91
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,030
<3-8,BECKETT>不管这个人是谁  他都在找什么东西
<3-8,BECKETT>Well, whoever he is, he was looking for something.

92
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,090
<3-8,BECKETT>这个房间被搜过
<3-8,BECKETT>This place has been searched.

93
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,290
<3-9,ESPOSITO>不过我们知道她并没遭劫
<3-9,ESPOSITO>The one thing we do know is that she was not robbed.

94
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,600
<3-9,ESPOSITO>钱包  手表和现金都在
<3-9,ESPOSITO>Her wallet, watch, and cash were untouched.

95
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,410
<3-10,BECKETT>蕾妮  什么情况
<3-10,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie, how does it look?

96
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,170
<3-11,LANIE>你等得太久了
<3-11,LANIE>Like you waited too long.

97
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,520
<3-12,BECKETT>我问被害人
<3-12,BECKETT>The vic.

98
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,350
<3-13,LANIE>她是被掐死的  但是也挣扎过
<3-13,LANIE>She was strangled but she went down with a fight.

99
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,430
<3-13,LANIE>初步看她跟凶手打过一架
<3-13,LANIE>Prelim suggests a sign of a struggle.

100
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,120
<3-13,LANIE>脸上吃了一拳
<3-13,LANIE>She took one to the face.

101
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,660
<3-14,BECKETT>穿着时尚  充满魅力的女人
<3-14,BECKETT>A well-dressed, attractive woman

102
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,290
<3-14,BECKETT>却来破烂的汽车旅馆
<3-14,BECKETT>in a seedy motel

103
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,860
<3-14,BECKETT>又有个男人逃离犯罪现场
<3-14,BECKETT>and a guy who flees the crime scene--

104
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,430
<3-14,BECKETT>看来是一夜情出了差错
<3-14,BECKETT>This might have been a one-night stand gone wrong.

105
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,190
<3-15,LANIE>现在是在说被害人还是卡塞尔
<3-15,LANIE>Are we talking about the victim or Castle?

106
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,620
<3-16,BECKETT>埃斯波
<3-16,BECKETT>Hey, Espo.

<3-18,BECKETT>Can you contact the next of kin

109
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,060
<3-18,BECKETT>画像完成后再排查一下附近区域
<3-18,BECKETT>and canvass the area once the sketch is done?

110
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,000
<3-19,ESPOSITO>好
<3-19,ESPOSITO>Yeah, no problem.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
<3-20,KEVIN RYAN>贝克特

<3-21,RYAN>在手包的侧袋里发现了她的名片
<3-21,RYAN>Found the vic's business card in the side pocket of her purse.

113
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,240
<3-21,RYAN>看来她在曼哈顿工作
<3-21,RYAN>Looks like she works in Manhattan.

<4-1,CLAIRE PANCHARD>Naomi was one of our top models.

117
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,200
<4-2,BECKETT>所以她来纽约是为了工作吗
<4-2,BECKETT>So she was in the city for work?

118
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,610
<4-3,CLAIRE>她往返于纽约和伦敦
<4-3,CLAIRE>She split her time between here and London.

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,000
<4-3,CLAIRE>顶尖模特一般
<4-3,CLAIRE>The good ones usually end up

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
<4-3,CLAIRE>会在纽约待上大半年时间
<4-3,CLAIRE>spending at least half the year in New York.

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,740
<4-4,BECKETT>你知不知道为什么
<4-4,BECKETT>Now do you have any idea

122
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,720
<4-4,BECKETT>她昨晚会去亚力山卓汽车旅馆
<4-4,BECKETT>why she was at the Alexandria Motel last night?

123
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,930
<4-5,CLAIRE>不知道  我从来没听说过那个地方
<4-5,CLAIRE>Uh, no. I've never even heard of it.

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,400
<4-6,CASTLE>是个时租旅馆
<4-6,CASTLE>It's one of those, um, pay-by-the-hour places.

125
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,630
<4-7,BECKETT>你认识这个人吗
<4-7,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

126
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,710
<4-8,CLAIRE>不  不认识
<4-8,CLAIRE>No. No, I don't.

127
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,340
<4-9,BECKETT>但你知道他可能是谁吧
<4-9,BECKETT>But you do have an idea of who he might be.

128
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,990
<4-9,BECKETT>事实上...
<4-9,BECKETT>It's just...

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,910
<4-10,CLAIRE>最近
<4-10,CLAIRE>lately,

130
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,680
<4-10,CLAIRE>娜奥米做了改变
<4-10,CLAIRE>Naomi was making some choices.

131
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,450
<4-11,BECKETT>什么样的改变
<4-11,BECKETT>What kind of choices?

132
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,340
<4-12,CLAIRE>她似乎厌倦了正常的模特工作
<4-12,CLAIRE>Well, she seemed to have lost interest in standard modeling jobs.

133
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,040
<4-12,CLAIRE>最近  她接了很多
<4-12,CLAIRE>Recently, she had been booking more, uh,

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,300
<4-12,CLAIRE>非常规的活儿
<4-12,CLAIRE>unconventional gigs.

135
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,470
<4-13,BECKETT>比如说
<4-13,BECKETT>Like what?

136
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,250
<4-14,CLAIRE>我听说一个月前伦敦办事处
<4-14,CLAIRE>Well, I heard the London office booked her to attend

137
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,110
<4-14,CLAIRE>预约她去参加国外高官的生日派对
<4-14,CLAIRE>the birthday party of some foreign dignitary a few months ago.

138
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,180
<4-15,BECKETT>她被雇佣去参加派对
<4-15,BECKETT>She was hired to go to a party?

139
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,030
<4-16,CLAIRE>模特被雇佣去参加高端的活动很正常
<4-16,CLAIRE>It's common for models to get hired to pretty-up an event.

140
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,240
<4-16,CLAIRE>一些姑娘们靠这个赚一些零花钱
<4-16,CLAIRE>Some girls do it to pick up extra cash.

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,850
<4-16,CLAIRE>其他的把它当做和富人们联络的机会
<4-16,CLAIRE>And other girls do it as a way of connecting with wealthy men.

142
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,140
<4-17,CASTLE>等等  你是说
<4-17,CASTLE>Uh, wait. Are you saying

143
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,540
<4-17,CASTLE>娜奥米出租自己当应召女郎
<4-17,CASTLE>that Naomi was hiring herself out as an escort?

144
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,480
<4-18,CLAIRE>我就是没想到娜奥米这样的好姑娘
<4-18,CLAIRE>You just don't see girls as good as Naomi

145
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,120
<4-18,CLAIRE>干这些派对的活
<4-18,CLAIRE>taking these party jobs.

146
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,860
<4-18,CLAIRE>除非这里面包含了更大的收入
<4-18,CLAIRE>Not unless there's a bigger payout involved somewhere.

147
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,710
<4-19,BECKETT>她最近参加这样的活动了吗
<4-19,BECKETT>Do you know if she took on any of these kinds of gigs recently?

148
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,230
<4-20,CLAIRE>那不是我们的主业
<4-20,CLAIRE>It's not really what we do.

149
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,860
<4-20,CLAIRE>不过她的确想让我帮她参加昨晚的一个活动
<4-20,CLAIRE>She did want me to try to get her into an event last night, though,

150
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,500
<4-20,CLAIRE>是在市中心举行的一个专辑发布会
<4-20,CLAIRE>uh, an album launch party in midtown.

151
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,870
<4-20,CLAIRE>但是我没有什么关系
<4-20,CLAIRE>But I didn't have any connections to it.

152
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,050
<4-21,BECKETT>昨天晚上
<4-21,BECKETT>Last night?

153
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,550
<4-21,BECKETT>是的
<4-21,BECKETT>Yeah.

154
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
<5-1,BECKETT>你跟我想的一样吗
<5-1,BECKETT>Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

155
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,450
<5-2,CASTLE>是啊  我们应该举办一个派对
<5-2,CASTLE>Yeah, that we should throw a party

156
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,840
<5-2,CASTLE>再雇一群模特
<5-2,CASTLE>and hire a bunch of models.

157
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,180
<5-2,CASTLE>不
<5-2,CASTLE>No.

158
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,310
<5-3,BECKETT>娜奥米昨晚可能混进了那个派对
<5-3,BECKETT>That maybe Naomi somehow got into that party last night

159
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,220
<5-3,BECKETT>她就是在那遇到了凶手
<5-3,BECKETT>and that that's where she met her killer.

160
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,670
<5-3,BECKETT>我是这么想的
<5-3,BECKETT>That's what I was thinking.

161
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,640
<5-4,CASTLE>真奇怪  我们通常想法是一致的
<5-4,CASTLE>Weird. We're usually more in sync than that.

162
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,860
<5-5,BECKETT>莱恩
<5-5,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan.

163
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,080
<5-5,BECKETT>你在娜奥米的公寓找到什么了吗
<5-5,BECKETT>Did you find anything at Naomi's apartment?

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,760
<5-6,RYAN>没有  但有人可能找到了
<5-6,RYAN>No, but someone else might have.

165
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,610
<5-6,RYAN>公寓被翻了个底朝天
<5-6,RYAN>It's been tossed.

166
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,190
<5-6,RYAN>不只这样  一个邻居说
<5-6,RYAN>Not only that, but a neighbor said

167
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,270
<5-6,RYAN>昨天很晚他们看到一个男的离开了公寓
<5-6,RYAN>they saw a man leaving the apartment late last night.

168
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,950
<5-6,RYAN>邻居通过素描确认了该男子
<5-6,RYAN>The neighbor I.D.'ed him off the sketch.

169
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
<5-6,RYAN>和逃离谋杀现场的是一个人
<5-6,RYAN>It's the same guy who fled the murder scene.

170
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,180
<5-7,CASTLE>他在旅馆找不到自己想要的东西
<5-7,CASTLE>He couldn't find what he was looking for in the motel

171
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,490
<5-7,CASTLE>于是他去搜了她的住处
<5-7,CASTLE>so he searched her place.

172
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,120
<5-8,RYAN>是啊  但这次他露了马脚
<5-8,RYAN>Yeah, but this time, he left a footprint.

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,750
<5-9,BECKETT>你的意思是
<5-9,BECKETT>Meaning?

174
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,530
<5-10,RYAN>巡逻警员根据这个素描
<5-10,RYAN>Well, units canvassed

175
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,960
<5-10,RYAN>在公寓周围进行了排查
<5-10,RYAN>around the apartment with the sketch.

176
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,160
<5-10,RYAN>他在隔几条街的地方用信用卡
<5-10,RYAN>He bought a bottle of single malt with a credit card

177
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,410
<5-10,RYAN>买了几瓶麦芽酒
<5-10,RYAN>a couple of blocks away.

178
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,680
<5-11,BECKETT>科林·亨特  我们了解他什么
<5-11,BECKETT>Colin Hunt. What do we have on him?

179
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,740
<5-11,BECKETT>系统里什么都没有
<5-11,BECKETT>Nothing in the system,

180
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,030
<5-12,RYAN>但是我从信用卡上查到了一些
<5-12,RYAN>but I ran a trace on the credit card.

181
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,320
<5-12,RYAN>他今天早上住进了蒙德里安苏豪酒店
<5-12,RYAN>He checked into the Mondrian SoHo this morning.

182
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,280
<5-12,RYAN>给你
<5-12,RYAN>Here.

183
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,230
<6-1,BECKETT>纽约警察局  举起手来
<6-1,BECKETT>NYPD. Show me your hands.

184
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,410
<6-2,COLIN HUNT>你们抓错人了
<6-2,COLIN HUNT>You're making a mistake.

185
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,830
<6-3,BECKETT>我不是第一次听这种话了
<6-3,BECKETT>Yeah, like I haven't heard that before.

186
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,630
<6-3,BECKETT>举起手来
<6-3,BECKETT>Hands in the air now.

187
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
<6-4,HUNT>如果你坚持要这样的话
<6-4,HUNT>If you insist.

188
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,980
<6-5,CASTLE>喔  伙计
<6-5,CASTLE>Whoa. Dude. Whoa.

189
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,660
<6-6,HUNT>自我介绍一下
<6-6,HUNT>Allow me to introduce myself.

190
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,170
<6-6,HUNT>科林·亨特警部  来自苏格兰场
<6-6,HUNT>Detective Inspector Colin Hunt, Scotland Yard.

200
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,190
<7-1,BECKETT>你真是身在他乡啊  亨特警部
<7-1,BECKETT>You're a long way from home, Detective Inspector Hunt.

201
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,090
<7-1,BECKETT>你最怎么会出现在那女孩的旅馆房间
<7-1,BECKETT>How did you end up in that dead girl's motel room ?

202
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,790
<7-2,HUNT>我昨晚在华盛顿开研讨会的时候
<7-2,HUNT>I was at a seminar in D.C. last night

203
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,980
<7-2,HUNT>娜奥米打电话给我  听起来很慌张
<7-2,HUNT>when Naomi called me, panicked.

204
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,420
<7-2,HUNT>她说她有麻烦了  需要我帮忙
<7-2,HUNT>She said she was in trouble and needed my help.

205
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,300
<7-3,CASTLE>你认识她
<7-3,CASTLE>So you knew her?

206
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,550
<7-4,HUNT>娜奥米就像我的妹妹一样
<7-4,HUNT>Naomi was like a sister to me.

207
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,280
<7-4,HUNT>她爸爸特伦斯是我当警察后的第一个搭档
<7-4,HUNT>Her dad Terence was my first partner on the job.

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,930
<7-4,HUNT>他去世的时候
<7-4,HUNT>When he passed away,

209
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,940
<7-4,HUNT>我答应她的家人会照顾好她
<7-4,HUNT>I promised her family that I'd look after her.

210
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,260
<7-4,HUNT>她打完电话  我就乘下一班飞机过来了
<7-4,HUNT>After she called me, I grabbed the next flight,

211
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,310
<7-4,HUNT>等我到的时候  已经太迟了
<7-4,HUNT>but by the time I arrived, it was too late.

212
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,980
<7-5,BECKETT>你的第一反应是逃离犯罪现场
<7-5,BECKETT>And your first instinct was to flee the crime scene?

213
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,420
<7-6,HUNT>我没有逃走  是离开
<7-6,HUNT>I didn't flee. I left.

214
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,720
<7-6,HUNT>她死了
<7-6,HUNT>She was dead.

215
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,290
<7-6,HUNT>我没什么能做的
<7-6,HUNT>There was nothing else to do.

216
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,410
<7-7,BECKETT>是啊  除了到处转转
<7-7,BECKETT>Yeah, except maybe to hang around

217
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,650
<7-7,BECKETT>给警察做个口供
<7-7,BECKETT>and give the police a statement.

218
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,620
<7-8,HUNT>你我都知道  如果我留在那
<7-8,HUNT>You and I both know that if I stuck around,

219
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,670
<7-8,HUNT>会是好几个小时的审问  之后你们就会
<7-8,HUNT>it'd be hours of questioning, and then you'd send me off

220
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,260
<7-8,HUNT>把我打发走说"谢谢你  保持联系"
<7-8,HUNT>with a "Cheers, we'll keep you posted."

221
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,290
<7-9,BECKETT>但是我想你有更重要的事情要做
<7-9,BECKETT>But I suppose you had something more important to do.

222
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,980
<7-10,HUNT>房间被搜索过了
<7-10,HUNT>The room had been searched.

223
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,040
<7-10,HUNT>杀她的人一定在找什么东西
<7-10,HUNT>Whoever killed her was looking for something.

224
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,090
<7-10,HUNT>我想他们接下来会去她的公寓
<7-10,HUNT>I thought they might try her apartment next.

225
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,000
<7-10,HUNT>等我到那  房间已经被搜过了
<7-10,HUNT>By the time I got there, it had already been tossed.

226
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,810
<7-10,HUNT>我知道我不应该被调查
<7-10,HUNT>Look, I know I shouldn't have been investigating,

227
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,150
<7-10,HUNT>但是如果你在国外
<7-10,HUNT>but if you were in a foreign country

228
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,770
<7-10,HUNT>你爱的人被杀了  你会怎么做
<7-10,HUNT>and someone you loved was killed, what would you do?

229
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,020
<7-11,CASTLE>他们在找什么
<7-11,CASTLE>What were they looking for?

230
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,500
<7-12,HUNT>执勤的时候  娜奥米的爸爸总是
<7-12,HUNT>When he was on a job, Naomi's dad used to stash a gun

231
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,590
<7-12,HUNT>在防弹衣内衬里藏把枪
<7-12,HUNT>in the lining of his Kevlar.

232
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,610
<7-12,HUNT>娜奥米少年时开始当模特之后
<7-12,HUNT>When Naomi started modeling as a teenager,

233
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,640
<7-12,HUNT>他不想让她坐地铁时没有任何保护
<7-12,HUNT>he didn't want her on the underground without any protection,

234
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,190
<7-12,HUNT>于是  他教她在夹克的内衬
<7-12,HUNT>So he taught her to cut a tiny piece

235
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,970
<7-12,HUNT>剪一个口放防狼喷雾
<7-12,HUNT>of the lining in her jacket to stash pepper spray.

236
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,100
<7-12,HUNT>我就是在那找到它的
<7-12,HUNT>That's where I found it.

237
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,360
<7-13,BECKETT>你找到了什么
<7-13,BECKETT>You found what?

238
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,060
<7-14,HUNT>一个指引我找到凶手的讯息
<7-14,HUNT>A message to me about her killer.

239
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,760
<7-15,CASTLE>什么样的讯息
<7-15,CASTLE>What kind of message?

240
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,110
<7-16,HUNT>让我办案才能告诉你
<7-16,HUNT>Not until I'm on the case.

241
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,550
<7-17,BECKETT>你说什么
<7-17,BECKETT>Excuse me?

242
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
<7-18,HUNT>探长  麻烦你
<7-18,HUNT>Detective, please,

243
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,090
<7-18,HUNT>我欠娜奥米的
<7-18,HUNT>I owe this to Naomi.

244
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,670
<7-18,HUNT>我欠她全家的
<7-18,HUNT>I owe it to her family.

245
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,720
<7-19,BECKETT>你很清楚我可以因为你
<7-19,BECKETT>You do realize that I could arrest you

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
<7-19,BECKETT>隐瞒证据逮捕你吧
<7-19,BECKETT>for withholding evidence?

247
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,030
<7-20,HUNT>既然你不知道证据是什么
<7-20,HUNT>And since you don't know what that evidence is,

248
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,260
<7-20,HUNT>我大可否认
<7-20,HUNT>I could deny it.

249
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,250
<7-20,HUNT>这么你来我往也抓不到杀她的凶手
<7-20,HUNT>And none of that will get us any closer to catching her killer.

250
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,460
<7-20,HUNT>让我和你们一起办案吧
<7-20,HUNT>Let me work this case with you,

251
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,710
<7-20,HUNT>我发誓  如果你不同意的话
<7-20,HUNT>because if you don't, I swear,

252
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,580
<7-20,HUNT>我会自己去抓住这个混蛋
<7-20,HUNT>I will go out there and catch the bastard on my own.

253
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,770
<7-20,HUNT>好吧
<7-20,HUNT>Okay.

254
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,770
<7-21,BECKETT>但是我要先向警监请示一下
<7-21,BECKETT>But I have to check in with my Captain first.

255
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,990
<8-1,HUNT>你们的警监人怎么样
<8-1,HUNT>What's she like, your Captain?

256
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,730
<8-2,CASTLE>你看没看过视频网站上
<8-2,CASTLE>You ever see that YouTube video

257
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,900
<8-2,CASTLE>一只灰熊一巴掌
<8-2,CASTLE>of the grizzly bear that decapitates a moose

258
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,710
<8-2,CASTLE>拍死一只驼鹿的视频
<8-2,CASTLE>with one swipe of its paw?

259
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,070
<8-3,HUNT>这比喻让我很"安心"
<8-3,HUNT>Comforting.

260
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,820
<8-4,CASTLE>不是针对个别人
<8-4,CASTLE>It's nothing personal.

261
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,410
<8-4,CASTLE>她就是不喜欢外人来她的分局
<8-4,CASTLE>She just doesn't like outsiders in her precinct.

262
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,700
<8-5,HUNT>我不需要她喜欢  我只要她能允许
<8-5,HUNT>I don't need her to like it. I just need her to allow it.

263
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,210
<8-5,HUNT>娜奥米的整件事情根本说不通
<8-5,HUNT>This whole thing with Naomi doesn't add up.

264
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,400
<8-5,HUNT>拒绝传统的模特工作
<8-5,HUNT>Turning down conventional modeling jobs,

265
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,100
<8-5,HUNT>而去接私人派对那种庸俗的活动
<8-5,HUNT>booking sleazy gigs at private parties--

266
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,190
<8-5,HUNT>凭我的了解  娜奥米不是这种人
<8-5,HUNT>that just doesn't sound like the Naomi I know.

267
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,540
<8-6,CASTLE>有时候我们自以为了解某人
<8-6,CASTLE>Yeah, well, sometimes it's the people we think we know best

268
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,160
<8-6,CASTLE>结果却对她一无所知
<8-6,CASTLE>that we don't really know at all.

269
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,730
<8-7,BECKETT>算你一个
<8-7,BECKETT>You're in.

270
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,780
<8-8,HUNT>谢谢
<8-8,HUNT>Thank you.

271
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,910
<8-8,HUNT>什么
<8-8,HUNT>What?

272
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,960
<8-9,CASTLE>没搞错吧
<8-9,CASTLE>Seriously?

273
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,730
<8-10,BECKETT>你苏格兰场的主管
<8-10,BECKETT>Yeah, your supervisor at Scotland Yard

274
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,100
<8-10,BECKETT>说你是一名干探
<8-10,BECKETT>said you're one of the best.

275
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,610
<8-10,BECKETT>就连盖茨警监也对你的履历十分赞赏
<8-10,BECKETT>Even Captain Gates was impressed with your record.

276
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,990
<8-11,CASTLE>原来不是所有外人她都看不过眼
<8-11,CASTLE>Well, I guess it's not outsiders she doesn't like.

277
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,010
<8-11,CASTLE>只是讨厌我罢了
<8-11,CASTLE>It's just me.

278
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,960
<8-12,BECKETT>说话算话  娜奥米留给你的东西呢
<8-12,BECKETT>Look, we had a deal. What did Naomi give you?

279
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,900
<8-13,HUNT>这个
<8-13,HUNT>This.

280
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,570
<8-14,CASTLE>钥匙
<8-14,CASTLE>A key?

281
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,740
<8-14,CASTLE>你之前说的是信息
<8-14,CASTLE>You said she left a message.

282
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,010
<8-15,HUNT>这就是信息
<8-15,HUNT>This is the message.

283
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,230
<8-15,HUNT>她有意留给我去找的
<8-15,HUNT>She put it in there for me to find.

284
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,820
<8-15,HUNT>我敢肯定这跟她的死有关
<8-15,HUNT>I guarantee, it has something to do with her death.

285
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,910
<8-16,BECKETT>看着像商用钥匙
<8-16,BECKETT>This looks commercial.

286
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,780
<8-17,HUNT>这是阿尔克·里夫金 11-30-r型号的
<8-17,HUNT>It's an Arco-Rifkin 11-30-r,

287
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,110
<8-17,HUNT>大多用于火车站或健身俱乐部的
<8-17,HUNT>mostly used for lockers like those found at train stations

288
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,610
<8-17,HUNT>储物柜
<8-17,HUNT>or health clubs.

289
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,110
<8-18,BECKETT>好  我让莱恩在她公寓
<8-18,BECKETT>All right, well, I'll have Ryan canvass

290
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,070
<8-18,BECKETT>和汽车旅馆附近进行排查
<8-18,BECKETT>the area around her apartment and the motel.

291
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,090
<8-18,BECKETT>看有没有哪家店的储物柜
<8-18,BECKETT>We'll see if any of the businesses have lockers

292
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,030
<8-18,BECKETT>配了这种钥匙
<8-18,BECKETT>that use this kind of key.

293
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,120
<8-19,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<8-19,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

297
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,470
<8-20,BECKETT>来自苏格兰场
<8-20,BECKETT>He's from Scotland Yard.

298
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,980
<8-20,BECKETT>这件案子他也会参与调查
<8-20,BECKETT>He's gonna be consulting on this case.

299
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,010
<8-20,BECKETT>-他认识死者  -你好
<8-20,BECKETT>- He knows our victim. - Hey. How's it going?

<8-23,BECKETT>- Pleasure, mate. - So what do you got?

301
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,190
<8-24,ESPOSITO>娜奥米昨晚确实参加了那个专辑发行派对
<8-24,ESPOSITO>Well, Naomi did make it to that album release party last night

302
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,990
<8-24,ESPOSITO>是在市中心的一家俱乐部
<8-24,ESPOSITO>at a club in midtown,

303
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,170
<8-24,ESPOSITO>但十点左右的时候她被保安赶了出来
<8-24,ESPOSITO>but she was kicked out by security around 10:00.

304
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,720
<8-25,HUNT>为什么
<8-25,HUNT>Why?

305
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,530
<8-26,ESPOSITO>她跟主办人发生了争执  是个饶舌女歌手
<8-26,ESPOSITO>She had an altercation with the host, female rapper

<8-26,ESPOSITO>and ex-felon Nicky Jay.

307
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,170
<8-26,ESPOSITO>她也不怕在狗仔队面前大打出手
<8-26,ESPOSITO>And she wasn't afraid to take a swing in front of paparazzi.

308
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,210
<8-27,CASTLE>为什么打起来
<8-27,CASTLE>Wow. What was the fight about?

309
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,770
<8-28,ESPOSITO>不清楚  但警员正带她回来问话
<8-28,ESPOSITO>Unclear, but uniforms are bringing her up to interrogation now.

310
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,100
<8-29,HUNT>你们都是一个人问话吗
<8-29,HUNT>Do you usually question them solo?

311

<8-30,BECKETT>不  一般都是我跟卡塞尔一起
<8-30,BECKETT>No, Castle and I usually go in together.

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,490
<8-31,CASTLE>要不这样吧  这次还是你俩来吧
<8-31,CASTLE>Actually, you know what? Why don't you guys take this one?

313
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,530
<8-32,BECKETT>你确定
<8-32,BECKETT>Are you sure?

<8-33,CASTLE>非常确定
<8-33,CASTLE>Yeah, absolutely.

315
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,260
<8-33,CASTLE>再说  这事关系到科林的朋友
<8-33,CASTLE>Besides, Colin's got a personal interest.

316
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,400
<8-33,CASTLE>-而不是我的  -好吧
<8-33,CASTLE>- And I really don't now, do I? - Ah. All right.

<8-35,BECKETT>-就这么定了  -好吧
<8-35,BECKETT>- It's settled then. - Yeah, I guess it is.

318
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,080
<8-36,CASTLE>而且我约了人吃午饭  她来了
<8-36,CASTLE>Yeah, besides, my lunch date is here.

319
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,340
<8-36,CASTLE>几个小时就回来
<8-36,CASTLE>I'll be back in a few hours.

320
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,890
<8-36,CASTLE>有眉目了就打电话给我
<8-36,CASTLE>You guys call me if you find anything interesting.

321
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,890
<9-1,NICKI J>见鬼  没错  我是打了她
<9-1,NICKI J>Hell, yeah, I clocked her.

322
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,660
<9-1,NICKI J>她想勾引我男人
<9-1,NICKI J>She was trying to make a move on my man.

323
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,720
<9-2,BECKETT>-是斯林大佬吗  -没错
<9-2,BECKETT>- Your man Biggie Slim? - That's right.

324
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,250
<9-3,NICKI J>她居然厚颜无耻的说他让她
<9-3,NICKI J>She had the nerve to say that he told her

325
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,060
<9-3,NICKI J>留个电话给他
<9-3,NICKI J>to put her digits in his phone.

326
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,110
<9-4,HUNT>那他有没有
<9-4,HUNT>Did he?

327
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,370
<9-5,NICKI J>这不是重点
<9-5,NICKI J>That ain't the point!

328
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,940
<9-5,NICKI J>那个贱女人根本就不该去
<9-5,NICKI J>That skinny bitch wasn't even supposed to be there.

329
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,480
<9-5,NICKI J>我找她对质的时候
<9-5,NICKI J>When I got up in her face,

330
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,740
<9-5,NICKI J>她说是斯林大佬的表弟德鲁让她来的
<9-5,NICKI J>she said Biggie Slim's cousin Drew told her about the party.

331
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,840
<9-5,NICKI J>但这就是扯淡  因为德鲁根本不在受邀之列
<9-5,NICKI J>But I knew that was B.S. Because Drew wasn't even invited.

332
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,920
<9-6,HUNT>你男人到处沾花惹草
<9-6,HUNT>It must make you so bloody mad

333
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,050
<9-6,HUNT>你肯定很恼火吧
<9-6,HUNT>to know your man has a wandering eye.

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,210
<9-6,HUNT>我也交过这样的女朋友
<9-6,HUNT>I had a girlfriend like that.

335
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,080
<9-6,HUNT>到处出差
<9-6,HUNT>Traveled for business.

336
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,170
<9-6,HUNT>她从机场打来说航班取消了
<9-6,HUNT>She'd ring from the airport to say her flight was canceled.

337
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,950
<9-6,HUNT>我后来才发现  她劈腿了
<9-6,HUNT>I come to find out, she was seeing some other bloke.

338
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,140
<9-7,NICKI J>听着她是个婊子
<9-7,NICKI J>She sound like a ho.

339
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,490
<9-8,HUNT>我是想说  我理解你出于本能
<9-8,HUNT>All I'm saying is, I understand your instinct

340
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,440
<9-8,HUNT>痛扁你认为夺你所爱的人
<9-8,HUNT>to lash out at the person you believe is responsible.

341
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,560
<9-9,NICKI J>防火防盗防小三  你也该跟姐学学
<9-9,NICKI J>I protect what's mine. You should do the same.

342
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,910
<9-10,BECKETT>所以这就尾随娜奥米去汽车旅馆
<9-10,BECKETT>Is that why you followed Naomi to the motel

343
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,520
<9-10,BECKETT>然后徒手把她勒死吗
<9-10,BECKETT>and strangled her with your bare hands?

344
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,390
<9-11,NICKI J>你嗑药了吧
<9-11,NICKI J>You must be high.

345
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,690
<9-11,NICKI J>那个贱人犯不着我浪费那个时间
<9-11,NICKI J>That skank wasn't worth another second of my time.

346
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,310
<9-11,NICKI J>我叫保安赶她出去
<9-11,NICKI J>I told security to give her the boot,

347
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,290
<9-11,NICKI J>仅此而已
<9-11,NICKI J>and that was that.

348
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,100
<9-12,BECKETT>是吗  你能证明吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Really? Can you prove it?

349
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,660
<9-13,NICKI J>我司机送我们回的家
<9-13,NICKI J>My driver brought us home.

350
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,040
<9-13,NICKI J>然后整晚我都跟斯林大佬在一起
<9-13,NICKI J>And I was with Biggie Slim the rest of the night.

351
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,010
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>对  我跟妮基·杰一起回的家
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>Yeah, I went home with Nicky Jay.

352
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,200
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>打完人之后  她情绪很激动
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>After the tussle, she was all worked up.

353
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,060
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>但我喜欢她这样
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>But I like it when she gets worked up,

354
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,250
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>拼命想证明我是她的
<10-1,BIGGIE SLIM>when she got something to prove.

355
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,100
<10-2,BECKETT>她说动手的原因是因为
<10-2,BECKETT>She said that the fight started because you were

356
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,050
<10-2,BECKETT>你在跟她搭讪
<10-2,BECKETT>spending time with this girl.

357
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,950
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>对  这个妞儿
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>Oh, yeah, that girl.

358
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,450
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>能说什么呢
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>Hey, what can I say?

359
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,090
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>我貌比潘安  才比子建  哪个女人抵挡得住
<10-3,BIGGIE SLIM>Women are powerless against my good looks and charms.

360
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,360
<10-4,HUNT>真是残忍的诅咒啊
<10-4,HUNT>Yes, it's a real curse.

361
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,260
<10-4,HUNT>你和娜奥米  你们谈什么了
<10-4,HUNT>You and Naomi-- what did you talk about?

362
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,640
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>东拉西扯呗
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>Ah, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

363
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,550
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>这妞不咋的
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>She was a bad chick, you know?

364
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,470
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>有点疯  你懂我意思吗
<10-5,BIGGIE SLIM>But a little off. You know what I'm talking about?

365
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,570
<10-6,HUNT>不懂  说明白点
<10-6,HUNT>No, what are you talkin' about?

366
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,840
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>她有点妄想症
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>I mean, she was acting paranoid, man,

367
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,960
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>说有人尾随她到派对
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>said somebody had followed her to the party.

368
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,570
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>我以为她在编故事呢
<10-7,BIGGIE SLIM>I figured she was just blowing smoke.

369
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,730
<10-8,HUNT>为什么
<10-8,HUNT>Why is that?

370
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,310
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>我不仅仅在包装妮基·杰
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>Look, I don't just produce Nicky Jay, all right?

371
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,970
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>还在建立自己的品牌
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>I'm building my brand.

372
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,410
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>我有斯林大佬唱片公司  有斯林大佬服饰
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>I got Biggie Slim records, Biggie Slim clothing.

373
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,860
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>甚至还生产了斯林大佬能量饮料
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>Hell, I even got a Biggie Slim energy drink.

374
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,450
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>所以有妹子过来求关注
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>So some filly comes up trying to make her time,

375
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,970
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>我都见怪不怪了
<10-9,BIGGIE SLIM>it's just a everyday thing in my life.

376
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,570
<10-10,BECKETT>她说没说她觉得是被谁跟踪了
<10-10,BECKETT>Did she tell you who she thought was following her?

377
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,930
<10-10,BECKETT>没有
<10-10,BECKETT>Sure didn't.

378
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,790
<10-11,BIGGIE SLIM>不过看来她是没撒谎
<10-11,BIGGIE SLIM>I guess she wasn't lying, though, huh?

379
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,790
<11-1,BECKETT>娜奥米离开派对后
<11-1,BECKETT>Naomi left that party

380
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,410
<11-1,BECKETT>三小时后就死了
<11-1,BECKETT>and then three hours later, she was dead.

381
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,840
<11-2,ESPOSITO>根据她对斯林大佬所说的
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Based on what she told Biggie Slim,

382
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,660
<11-2,ESPOSITO>娜奥米知道自己被跟踪了
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Naomi knew somebody was after her.

383
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,070
<11-3,BECKETT>在派对举办地周围排查一下
<11-3,BECKETT>All right, let's canvass the area around the party venue,

384
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,230
<11-3,BECKETT>看她是否真的被跟踪了
<11-3,BECKETT>see if she was being followed.

385
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,360
<11-3,BECKETT>再找来妮基·杰和斯林大佬的司机
<11-3,BECKETT>And let's track down Nicky Jay and Biggie Slim's driver.

386
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,670
<11-3,BECKETT>确认他们是否真的直接回家了
<11-3,BECKETT>I want to see if they went straight home.

387
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,800
<11-4,ESPOSITO>这就去办
<11-4,ESPOSITO>On it.

388
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,250
<11-5,BECKETT>你跟妮基·杰讲的关于你女朋友的故事
<11-5,BECKETT>So... that story that you told Nicky Jay about your girlfriend...

389
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,710
<11-6,HUNT>胡扯的
<11-6,HUNT>Total pants.

390
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,450
<11-6,HUNT>就是想让她以为我同情她
<11-6,HUNT>I just wanted her to think I sympathized.

391
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,160
<11-6,HUNT>说实话  见过了斯林大佬
<11-6,HUNT>And honestly, after meeting Biggie Slim,

392
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,470
<11-6,HUNT>我是真同情她
<11-6,HUNT>I do.

393
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,380
<11-7,BECKETT>或许她一直在等
<11-7,BECKETT>Well, maybe she's hanging on,

394
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,160
<11-7,BECKETT>希望他会改变
<11-7,BECKETT>hoping that he'll change.

395
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,620
<11-8,HUNT>他这样的人永远不会改变
<11-8,HUNT>Guys like him never do.

396
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,140
<11-9,BECKETT>法医已经验尸完毕
<11-9,BECKETT>Our M.E.'s finished the autopsy.

397
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,760
<12-1,LANIE>她喉部被挤碎
<12-1,LANIE>Her larynx is crushed.

398
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
<12-1,LANIE>凶手一定很强壮
<12-1,LANIE>Whoever did it was strong.

399
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,840
<12-1,LANIE>手掌很大  很有可能是男性
<12-1,LANIE>Large hands, probably a male.

400
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,810
<12-2,BECKETT>这把半个城的人都涵盖了
<12-2,BECKETT>That's like half the city.

401
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,620
<12-3,LANIE>我们还能再把范围缩小一些
<12-3,LANIE>We may be able to narrow it down a little further than that.

402
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,960
<12-3,LANIE>凶手力道很大
<12-3,LANIE>The pressure from the killer's grip

403
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,810
<12-3,LANIE>在她脖子上留下了指纹
<12-3,LANIE>left a print on her neck.

404
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,580
<12-4,BECKETT>能把指纹提取出来吗
<12-4,BECKETT>Were you able to pull a print?

405
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,860
<12-5,LANIE>幸亏她擦了乳液
<12-5,LANIE>We recovered a partial

406
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,540
<12-5,LANIE>我们恢复了部分指纹
<12-5,LANIE>thanks to the body lotion she was wearing.

407
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,950
<12-6,BECKETT>系统里有这枚指纹吗
<12-6,BECKETT>Is it in the system?

408
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,350
<12-7,LANIE>没法进行搜索  不过要是能有
<12-7,LANIE>Not enough to run it, but you bring me a print

409
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,050
<12-7,LANIE>嫌犯的指纹  我能验证它们是否吻合
<12-7,LANIE>off a suspect, I can tell you if it's a match.

410
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,460
<12-8,HUNT>不好意思  我得打个电话
<12-8,HUNT>Excuse me. I have to make a call.

411
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,000
<12-9,LANIE>长得不错
<12-9,LANIE>Easy on the eyes.

412
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,870
<12-9,LANIE>口音也很迷人
<12-9,LANIE>Cute accent, too.

413
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,330
<12-11,LANIE>我就问你一件事
<12-11,LANIE>I just got one question.

414
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,620
<12-13,LANIE>卡塞尔在哪
<12-13,LANIE>Where's Castle?

415
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,130
<12-14,BECKETT>他走了
<12-14,BECKETT>He took off...

416
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,080
<12-14,BECKETT>去赴一个午餐约会
<12-14,BECKETT>for a lunch date.

417
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,040
<12-15,LANIE>跟那个开他的法拉利的空姐吗
<12-15,LANIE>In a Ferrari full of flight attendant?

418
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,350
<12-16,BECKETT>是啊  估计是想多累积点
<12-16,BECKETT>Yeah, he's probably trying to rack up

419
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,150
<12-16,BECKETT>航空积分里程
<12-16,BECKETT>his frequent flyer miles.

420
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,510
<12-16,BECKETT>真抱歉
<12-16,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

421
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,940
<12-17,LANIE>不过你知道她只不过是过眼烟云
<12-17,LANIE>But you know she's just a passing thing.

422
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,840
<12-18,BECKETT>是吗  这家伙都离婚两次了
<12-18,BECKETT>Do I? I mean, the guy has been divorced twice,

423
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,180
<12-18,BECKETT>还去跟大胸女鬼混
<12-18,BECKETT>and he's still chasing bimbos.

424
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,710
<12-18,BECKETT>或许这就是他的本性
<12-18,BECKETT>Maybe that's just who he is.

425
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,550
<12-19,LANIE>也许时机不对
<12-19,LANIE>Look, maybe it's the wrong time

426
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,360
<12-19,LANIE>也或许他不是真命天子
<12-19,LANIE>or maybe he's even the wrong guy,

427
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,670
<12-19,LANIE>可如果他是
<12-19,LANIE>but if he is,

428
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,560
<12-19,LANIE>你要等多久才肯去问明白
<12-19,LANIE>how long are you gonna wait to find out?

429
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,330
<12-20,LANIE>十年了  我陪这些被害人
<12-20,LANIE>Ten years, I've been keeping them company

430
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,950
<12-20,LANIE>度过一两个晚上
<12-20,LANIE>while they spend a night or two here

431
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,560
<12-20,LANIE>然后他们就会化为灰尘  人终有一死
<12-20,LANIE>on their way to where we're all going.

432
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,620
<12-20,LANIE>他们都曾有自己的规划  凯特
<12-20,LANIE>They all had plans, Kate,

433
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,340
<12-20,LANIE>都有腾出空来就会做的事
<12-20,LANIE>things they were gonna do when they got around to it--

434
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,440
<12-20,LANIE>坐次游轮  减个九斤体重  谈个恋爱
<12-20,LANIE>go on a cruise, lose 10 pounds, fall in love.

435
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,950
<12-20,LANIE>他们本以为自己有大把时间
<12-20,LANIE>They thought they had all the time in the world.

436
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,820
<12-20,LANIE>但却事与愿违
<12-20,LANIE>But nobody does.

437
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,440
<13-1,BECKETT>看到自己亲近的人出事确实很难过
<13-1,BECKETT>The personal ones are tough.

438
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,600
<13-1,BECKETT>你不是出来打电话的
<13-1,BECKETT>No call.

439
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,770
<13-2,HUNT>你怎么看出来的
<13-2,HUNT>What's my tell?

440
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,440
<13-3,BECKETT>你沉思的身影
<13-3,BECKETT>The brooding lean.

441
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,610
<13-3,BECKETT>是啊
<13-3,BECKETT>Ah, yes.

442
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,530
<13-4,HUNT>我真菜
<13-4,HUNT>Rookie move.

443
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,860
<13-4,HUNT>她以前满嘴戴着牙箍
<13-4,HUNT>You know, even with a mouth full of braces,

444
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,180
<13-4,HUNT>也还是班里最漂亮的女孩子
<13-4,HUNT>she was the prettiest girl in her class.

445
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,100
<13-4,HUNT>有个警察父亲
<13-4,HUNT>Although having a cop for a dad

446
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,110
<13-4,HUNT>对她的社交生活没啥帮助
<13-4,HUNT>didn't do much for her social life.

447
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,280
<13-4,HUNT>她的约会对象们送她回家时
<13-4,HUNT>Terry used to interrogate her dates

448
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,710
<13-4,HUNT>特伦总是各种审问他们
<13-4,HUNT>when they'd drop her off.

449
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,510
<13-5,BECKETT>那些轻量级选手肯定就此淘汰了
<13-5,BECKETT>I could see how that would weed out the lightweights.

450
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,680
<13-6,HUNT>她22岁的时候
<13-6,HUNT>And then when she was 22,

451
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,570
<13-6,HUNT>爱上了一名年轻的医生  他是个好人
<13-6,HUNT>she fell in love with a young doctor, good guy.

452
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,140
<13-6,HUNT>去年他在非洲行医的时候去世了
<13-6,HUNT>He died last year in Africa doing god's work.

453
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
<13-6,HUNT>我觉得她一直都没有从阴影里走出来
<13-6,HUNT>I don't think she ever really got over it,

454
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,720
<13-6,HUNT>因为听了那么多她做的事情
<13-6,HUNT>because hearing what she was up to,

455
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,160
<13-6,HUNT>感觉她好像完全变了个人
<13-6,HUNT>it's like she was a different person.

456
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,280
<13-7,BECKETT>人总是在你不经意间就发生了变化
<13-7,BECKETT>People change when you're not looking.

457
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,500
<13-7,BECKETT>不好意思
<13-7,BECKETT>Excuse me.

458
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,860
<13-7,BECKETT>莱恩  怎么了
<13-7,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan. What's up?

459
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,520
<13-8,BECKETT>你确定
<13-8,BECKETT>Are you sure?

460
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,380
<13-8,BECKETT>在哪
<13-8,BECKETT>Where?

461
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,140
<13-8,BECKETT>好的  很好  申请搜查令
<13-8,BECKETT>Okay, great. Call in a warrant.

462
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,500
<13-9,BECKETT>他们在汽车旅馆旁找到一家健身房
<13-9,BECKETT>They found a gym near the motel.

463
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,040
<13-9,BECKETT>娜奥米被害当晚在那买了一张一日通票
<13-9,BECKETT>Naomi bought a day pass there the night that she was killed,

464
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,650
<13-9,BECKETT>员工说她进去之后三分钟就出来了
<13-9,BECKETT>and the clerk said she was in and out in three minutes.

465
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,970
<13-10,HUNT>这时间刚好够她把东西藏在
<13-10,HUNT>Just enough time to run in and hide something

466
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,260
<13-10,HUNT>某个储物箱里
<13-10,HUNT>in one of the lockers.

467
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,670
<14-1,RYAN>她在晚上10点24分买的一日通票
<14-1,RYAN>She bought the day pass at 10:24 P.M.

468
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,730
<14-2,HUNT>正好是在打电话向我求救的二十分钟之后
<14-2,HUNT>That's 20 minutes after she called me to say she was in trouble.

469
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,050
<14-3,HUNT>她是给我留下了一条信息
<14-3,HUNT>She was leaving me a message.

470
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,830
<14-4,BECKETT>她不仅仅给我们留下了有关凶手的信息
<14-4,BECKETT>She did better than leave a message about the killer.

471
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,200
<14-4,BECKETT>还给我们留下了他的照片
<14-4,BECKETT>She left us a picture of him as well.

472
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,620
<14-4,BECKETT>序列号搜索有结果吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Anything on the number sequence?

474
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,890
<15-1,BECKETT>我在搜索所有的数据库
<15-1,BECKETT>We're running it through every database,

475
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,800
<15-2,TECH GUY>目前还没有结果
<15-2,TECH GUY>but nothing so far.

476
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,440
<15-3,HUNT>娜奥米不会无故留下这条信息
<15-3,HUNT>Naomi wrote it on there for a reason.

477
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,680
<15-4,BECKETT>照片那头有线索吗
<15-4,BECKETT>What about the photo?

478
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,370
<15-5,TECH GUY>从光线和背景建筑来看
<15-5,TECH GUY>Well, based on the light and background architecture,

479
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,810
<15-5,TECH GUY>这张照片是在纽约市中心拍的
<15-5,TECH GUY>this photo was taken in midtown New York.

480
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,200
<15-6,CASTLE>我错过什么了吗
<15-6,CASTLE>Hey. What did I miss?

481
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,410
<15-7,BECKETT>没什么
<15-7,BECKETT>Not much.

482
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,230
<15-7,BECKETT>我们只不过找到了那个神秘的储物箱
<15-7,BECKETT>Oh, we did manage to find that mystery locker.

483
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,650
<15-7,BECKETT>还有那张照片里的男子
<15-7,BECKETT>And that guy in the photo,

484
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,930
<15-7,BECKETT>他很有可能是凶手
<15-7,BECKETT>he's probably our killer.

485
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,750
<15-7,BECKETT>午饭吃得怎么样
<15-7,BECKETT>So, how was your lunch?

486
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,140
<15-8,CASTLE>爱死那里的特色菜了
<15-8,CASTLE>Oh, I loved the special.

487
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,080
<15-9,BECKETT>必须的
<15-9,BECKETT>I'll bet.

488
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,860
<15-10,HUNT>等等
<15-10,HUNT>Wait a minute.

489
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,670
<15-10,HUNT>能放大这块区域吗
<15-10,HUNT>Can you blow up this one section?

490
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,870
<15-11,TECH GUY>当然
<15-11,TECH GUY>Yeah, sure.

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,350
<15-12,CASTLE>金色的圆状物  是块匾额
<15-12,CASTLE>Rounded and gold? It's a plaque.

492
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,150
<15-13,HUNT>是英国的标志
<15-13,HUNT>It's the British seal.

493
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,330
<15-13,HUNT>这张照片是在英国领事馆外拍的
<15-13,HUNT>This picture was taken right outside the British Consulate.

494
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,700
<15-14,BECKETT>把领事馆的雇员名单调出来
<15-14,BECKETT>Pull up a list of the Consulate employees.

495
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,060
<15-15,TECH GUY>好了
<15-15,TECH GUY>Here you go.

496
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,480
<15-16,HUNT>不在这页
<15-16,HUNT>Well, he's not on this page.

497
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,640
<15-17,CASTLE>就是他
<15-17,CASTLE>There he is.

<15-19,CASTLE>Deputy general of the British Consulate.

500
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,910
<15-20,HUNT>也就是说论官职  他仅次于总领事
<15-20,HUNT>Which means he's just under the Consulate General in rank,

501
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,630
<15-20,HUNT>负责财政以及后勤方面的

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,260
<15-20,HUNT>日常事务
<15-20,HUNT>in financial and logistical matters.

503
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,320
<15-21,BECKETT>娜奥米怎么会跟这家伙扯上关系
<15-21,BECKETT>What the hell was Naomi doing mixed up with this guy?

504
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,230
<16-1,HUNT>我跟一位苏格兰场的朋友联系了一下
<16-1,HUNT>That was my mate at Scotland Yard.

505
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,020
<16-1,HUNT>他发现一些跟奈吉尔·温德姆有关的怪事
<16-1,HUNT>He found out some intriguing details on Nigel Wyndham,

506
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,810
<16-1,HUNT>他的一个大学女友在他们
<16-1,HUNT>like the fact that a girlfriend in college

507
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,960

<16-1,HUNT>died rather mysteriously

508
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,370
<16-1,HUNT>的时候神秘死亡
<16-1,HUNT>while they were on holiday in Rome.

509
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,630
<16-2,GATES>他受过起诉吗
<16-2,GATES>Well, was he ever charged?

510
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,320
<16-3,HUNT>没有  之后他还牵扯进一系列案件调查
<16-3,HUNT>No, and after that, he had a string of bad investments

511
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,430
<16-3,HUNT>直到他娶了辛西娅·沃德罗
<16-3,HUNT>until he married Cynthia Wadlow.

512
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,420
<16-3,HUNT>她用自己显赫的家世
<16-3,HUNT>It was her prominent family

513
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,210
<16-3,HUNT>动用关系才给他谋了个职位
<16-3,HUNT>who pulled strings that got him a position,

514
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,640
<16-3,HUNT>首先是文化部部长

515
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,320
<16-3,HUNT>后来就到领事馆来了
<16-3,HUNT>and then here at the Consulate.

516
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,750
<16-4,ESPOSITO>我们一直在溯查娜奥米几周前到
<16-4,ESPOSITO>So we've been reconstructing Naomi's movements

<16-4,ESPOSITO>纽约后的所有行程
<16-4,ESPOSITO>since she landed in New York a couple of weeks ago.

<16-4,ESPOSITO>Now we showed the host Nigel's picture,

521
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,090
<16-4,ESPOSITO>他很确定俩人在那儿见过面
<16-4,ESPOSITO>and he confirmed that they met for dinner.

522
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,310
<16-5,BECKETT>店主注意到什么细节吗
<16-5,BECKETT>Did the host notice anything?

<16-6,ESPOSITO>那张百元钞票了
<16-6,ESPOSITO>to secure the romantic table in the back.

525

<16-6,ESPOSITO>各位

529
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,260
<16-8,GATES>感觉应该是吵架了
<16-8,GATES>Well, it sounds like a fight.

530
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,680
<16-9,RYAN>保安说在送娜奥米出去的时候听见她
<16-9,RYAN>Uh, security heard Naomi yell something about Cynthia

531
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,850
<16-9,RYAN>喊着辛西娅的一些事
<16-9,RYAN>as they escorted her out.

532
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,630
<16-9,RYAN>那就都说得通了
<16-9,RYAN>Well, it makes perfect sense.

536
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,240
<16-10,CASTLE>邂逅变成了晚宴  晚宴变成了幽会
<16-10,CASTLE>A chance meeting turns to dinner, dinner to a tryst,

537
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,920
<16-10,CASTLE>但娜奥米并不满足
<16-10,CASTLE>but then Naomi wants more.

538
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,130
<16-10,CASTLE>奈吉尔意识到他的出轨会威胁到

<16-13,HUNT>绝对不会倾心于温德姆这种人
<16-13,HUNT>would never fall for someone like Wyndham,

547
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,190
<16-13,HUNT>但如果这个人跟她的死没关系的话
<16-13,HUNT>but she wouldn't have left his picture in that locker

548
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,040
<16-13,HUNT>她肯定不会把这张照片留在储物柜里
<16-13,HUNT>if he weren't connected to her death somehow.

549
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,330
<16-14,GATES>奈吉尔·温德姆在领事馆的职位
<16-14,GATES>Nigel Wyndham's position at the consulate

550
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,880
<16-14,GATES>是享受外交豁免权的
<16-14,GATES>includes diplomatic immunity.

551
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,890
<16-15,BECKETT>但如果他是命案嫌疑人的话就无效了
<16-15,BECKETT>Which would be waived if he was a suspect in a murder case.

552
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,460
<16-16,GATES>如果我拿起电话提出审查请求的话
<16-16,GATES>If I pick up the phone to make that request,

553
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,960
<16-16,GATES>我需要一些比猜想更有说服力的东西
<16-16,GATES>I'm gonna need something more concrete than just a theory.

554
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,110
<16-17,BECKETT>长官  蕾妮在被害人的脖子上
<16-17,BECKETT>Sir, Lanie pulled our killer's prints

555
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,610
<16-17,BECKETT>已经提取到了凶手的指纹
<16-17,BECKETT>off of our victim's neck.

556
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,570
<16-17,BECKETT>根据我们目前掌握的所有情况来看
<16-17,BECKETT>And given everything that we know right now,

557
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,910
<16-17,BECKETT>我敢打赌那就是奈吉尔的指纹
<16-17,BECKETT>I am willing to bet that they're a match to Nigel's.

558
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,400
<16-18,GATES>赌是不够的
<16-18,GATES>A bet's not enough.

559
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,020
<16-18,GATES>但如果你能弄到指纹
<16-18,GATES>But if you can get those prints,

560
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,440
<16-18,GATES>那就另说了
<16-18,GATES>then this is a whole different conversation.

561
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,610
<17-1,ESPOSITO>麻烦来了  兄弟
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Here's the problem, bro--

562
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,200
<17-1,ESPOSITO>外国高官不会在当地的执法部门那里
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Foreign dignitaries don't register their fingerprints

563
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,100
<17-1,ESPOSITO>登记自己的指纹
<17-1,ESPOSITO>with local law enforcement.

564
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,420
<17-2,RYAN>如果我们向领事馆提出申请的话
<17-2,RYAN>And if we put in a request to the consulate,

565
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,570
<17-2,RYAN>他们会把拒绝我们的请求
<17-2,RYAN>they'll box us out

566
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,370
<17-2,RYAN>奈吉尔也就知道他现在是杀人嫌犯了
<17-2,RYAN>and alert Nigel that he's a suspect.

567
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,200
<17-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  我还以为苏格兰场能弄到指纹呢
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I thought Scotland Yard would be able to get them.

568
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,610
<17-4,RYAN>即便他在英国有关系  我们还是走到了死胡同
<17-4,RYAN>Even with his connections across the pond, we struck out.

569
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,970
<17-5,CASTLE>伙计们  看好了
<17-5,CASTLE>Okay, boys. Here it is.

570
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,200
<17-6,RYAN>看什么
<17-6,RYAN>Here's what?

571
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,820
<17-7,CASTLE>用来获取奈吉尔指纹的完美计划
<17-7,CASTLE>My foolproof plan for getting Nigel's fingerprint.

572
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,830
<17-7,CASTLE>奈吉尔住在公园大道的
<17-7,CASTLE>Nigel lives in a high-rise apartment

573
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,010
<17-7,CASTLE>一栋高级公寓里
<17-7,CASTLE>here on Park Avenue.

574
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,360
<17-8,ESPOSITO>对  安保级别也很高
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah. High security.

575
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,700
<17-9,CASTLE>没错  莱恩  你到时候在这里
<17-9,CASTLE>Exactly. Ryan, you'll be here--

576
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,210
<17-9,CASTLE>前门  扮成一个送花的快递员
<17-9,CASTLE>Front door-- dressed as a flower delivery boy.

577
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,020
<17-9,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  你扮成流浪汉到这里
<17-9,CASTLE>Esposito, you'll be here dressed as a hobo.

578
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,840
<17-9,CASTLE>我有疑问
<17-9,CASTLE>Question.

579
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,010
<17-10,ESPOSITO>为啥得是棕色皮肤的人来扮流浪汉
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Why's the brown man gotta be a hobo?

580
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,380
<17-11,CASTLE>你想送花吗
<17-11,CASTLE>You want the flowers?

581
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,180
<17-12,ESPOSITO>那还是流浪汉吧
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Hobo it is.

582
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,310
<17-13,CASTLE>你俩在这里负责吸引注意
<17-13,CASTLE>You boys will cause a distraction here

583
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,820
<17-13,CASTLE>而我和尼克莱一起从大楼的这边
<17-13,CASTLE>whilst I rappel down the side of the building

584
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,760
<17-13,CASTLE>-迂回过来  -尼克莱是谁
<17-13,CASTLE>- with Nicolai. - Who's Nicolai?

585
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,910
<17-15,CASTLE>是我在YouTube上找到的一个罗马尼亚体操运动员
<17-15,CASTLE>He's a Romanian gymnast I found on YouTube.

586
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,090
<17-15,CASTLE>他的身体柔韧性非常好
<17-15,CASTLE>He's extremely flexible

587
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,740
<17-15,CASTLE>可以藏在野营包里
<17-15,CASTLE>and fits in the duffel bag.

588
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,950
<17-15,CASTLE>再利用一把玻璃刀
<17-15,CASTLE>Using a glass cutter...

589
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,820
<17-16,HUNT>打扰一下  各位  我能
<17-16,HUNT>Excuse me, gents. I can--

590
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,510
<17-16,HUNT>有谁见到贝克特探长了吗
<17-16,HUNT>Has anyone seen Detective Beckett?

591
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,110
<17-17,RYAN>你俩这是要去约会吗
<17-17,RYAN>You guys going out?

592
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,170
<17-18,HUNT>我找了些关系  让我俩今晚能去
<17-18,HUNT>I pulled some strings and got us into a party

593
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,530
<17-18,HUNT>参加英国领事馆的一个宴会
<17-18,HUNT>at the British consulate tonight.

594
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,710
<17-19,BECKETT>奈吉尔也会参加
<17-19,BECKETT>Nigel will be there.

595
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,820
<17-19,BECKETT>我们会神不知鬼不觉地弄到他的指纹
<17-19,BECKETT>We'll get his prints, and he won't even know it.

596
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,170
<17-20,HUNT>告辞了  各位
<17-20,HUNT>Cheers, lads.

597
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,170
<17-20,HUNT>慢走
<17-20,HUNT>Cheers.

598
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,330
<17-21,RYAN>除了你那招也可以那样干
<17-21,RYAN>Or they could do that.

599
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,980
<17-21,RYAN>是哦
<17-21,RYAN>Yeah, sure,

600
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,050
<17-22,CASTLE>前提是你喜欢用技术含量低的法子
<17-22,CASTLE>if you want to do it the easy way.

601
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,770
<18-1,BECKETT>多谢
<18-1,BECKETT>Thank you.

602
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,150
<18-2,BECKETT>阿尔弗雷德·希斯爵士是谁啊
<18-2,BECKETT>So who is Sir Alfred Heath?

603
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,870
<18-3,HUNT>今天晚上是我
<18-3,HUNT>Tonight, I am.

604
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,530
<18-3,HUNT>国内的同事说真正的阿尔弗雷德爵士
<18-3,HUNT>The lads back home said the real Sir Alfred

605
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,680
<18-3,HUNT>肯定来不了
<18-3,HUNT>is down as a no-show.

606
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,060
<18-3,HUNT>因为痛风还是什么病来着
<18-3,HUNT>Gout or some damn thing.

607
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,540
<18-4,BECKETT>万一奈吉尔·温德姆也不来呢
<18-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but what if Nigel Wyndham doesn't show either?

608
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,380
<18-4,BECKETT>他肯定会来的
<18-4,BECKETT>He'll be here.

609
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,610
<18-5,HUNT>我猜他不会喝香槟
<18-5,HUNT>And I expect he'll skip the champagne

610
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,440
<18-5,HUNT>而是直接上高档的
<18-5,HUNT>and drink something posh and pretentious,

611
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,870
<18-5,HUNT>这样的话杯子上就有指纹了
<18-5,HUNT>leaving his print on the glass.

612
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,330
<18-6,BECKETT>万一他不喝酒呢
<18-6,BECKETT>Well, what if he doesn't drink?

613
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,820
<18-6,BECKETT>他是英国人
<18-6,BECKETT>He's British.

614
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,320
<18-7,HUNT>相信我  他肯定好这口
<18-7,HUNT>Trust me, he drinks.

615
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,590
<18-8,HUNT>我能邀请你吗
<18-8,HUNT>May I?

616
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,910
<18-9,BECKETT>我没想到这次行动还要跳舞
<18-9,BECKETT>I didn't realize that dancing was a part of the plan.

617
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,480
<18-10,HUNT>这样可以比较好地监视目标
<18-10,HUNT>It offers a perfect vantage point.

618
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,280
<18-12,BECKETT>你经常参加这种活动吗
<18-12,BECKETT>Do you come to a lot of these events?

619
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,740
<18-13,HUNT>当然没有  怎么了
<18-13,HUNT>No, thank God. Why?

620
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,000
<18-14,BECKETT>你好像很自信的样子
<18-14,BECKETT>You just seem very confident.

621
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,090
<18-15,HUNT>那是因为我的女伴
<18-15,HUNT>Well, that's because my companion

622
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,760
<18-15,HUNT>是这里最美丽最耀眼的女人
<18-15,HUNT>is the most beautiful woman in this room.

623
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,210
<18-16,BECKETT>你这显然是喝醉了胡说
<18-16,BECKETT>That's clearly the champagne talking.

624
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,640
<18-16,BECKETT>我相信你在这里感觉很自在
<18-16,BECKETT>I'm sure you're just comfortable here

625
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,470
<18-16,BECKETT>因为周围都是你们的人
<18-16,BECKETT>because you're amongst your own people.

626
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,630
<18-17,HUNT>他们才不是我们的人
<18-17,HUNT>These aren't my people.

627
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,840
<18-17,HUNT>我们的人都在端盘子送酒呢
<18-17,HUNT>My people are the ones carrying the trays.

628
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,450
<18-17,HUNT>没错
<18-17,HUNT>Yeah.

629
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,120
<18-17,HUNT>我是在伦敦东区[贫民区]长大的
<18-17,HUNT>I grew up on the east end.

630
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,940
<18-17,HUNT>我妈妈给别人打扫屋子  我爸爸在工厂上班
<18-17,HUNT>My mom cleaned flats. Dad worked in a factory.

631
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,620
<18-17,HUNT>他们都想要更好的生活  可他们就是
<18-17,HUNT>They wanted something better, they just--

632
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,410
<18-17,HUNT>他们就是得不到
<18-17,HUNT>They couldn't quite get it.

633
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:41,790
<18-18,BECKETT>然后呢
<18-18,BECKETT>And then?

634
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,840
<18-19,HUNT>我拿到的伊顿公学的奖学金
<18-19,HUNT>I was admitted to Eton on a scholarship

635
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,260
<18-19,HUNT>在那里我试着融入他们
<18-19,HUNT>where I minored in blending in.

636
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,000
<18-19,HUNT>你呢
<18-19,HUNT>What about you?

637
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:52,860
<18-20,BECKETT>我在纽约长大
<18-20,BECKETT>I grew up in the city

638
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,270
<18-20,BECKETT>去加州念的大学
<18-20,BECKETT>and, uh, went to college in California.

639
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,290
<18-21,HUNT>显然你可以做任何
<18-21,HUNT>Well, you could obviously do anything

640
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,220
<18-21,HUNT>你想做的事情
<18-21,HUNT>you put your mind to.

641
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,530
<18-21,HUNT>为啥要当警察呢
<18-21,HUNT>Why be a cop?

642
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,630
<18-22,BECKETT>我猜这就是我的使命吧
<18-22,BECKETT>I guess it was just my calling.

643
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,690
<18-23,HUNT>啊  你是个正义战士呢
<18-23,HUNT>Ah, a crusader.

644
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,790
<18-23,HUNT>我知道这种类型
<18-23,HUNT>I know the type.

645
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,420
<18-23,HUNT>但是一心工作  私人生活就遭殃了  是吧
<18-23,HUNT>Doesn't leave a lot of time for personal life, though, does it?

646
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,280
<18-24,BECKETT>那你呢  你也是正义战士吗
<18-24,BECKETT>What about you? Are you the crusader type as well?

647
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,040
<18-25,HUNT>我恐怕已经把工作当成老婆了
<18-25,HUNT>Married to the bit, I'm afraid.

648
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,590
<18-25,HUNT>工作总是放在首位
<18-25,HUNT>The job comes first.

649
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,130
<18-25,HUNT>只是有时候  我真希望不是这样
<18-25,HUNT>Though sometimes, I wish it didn't.

650
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,560
<18-26,BECKETT>是啊  我知道这种感觉
<18-26,BECKETT>Yeah. I know the feeling.

651
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,820
<18-27,BECKETT>等一下  看吧台那边
<18-27,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Look over there by the bar.

652
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,660
<18-27,BECKETT>一点钟方向
<18-27,BECKETT>At one o'clock.

653
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,410
<18-28,HUNT>游戏开始吧
<18-28,HUNT>Let the games begin.

654
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,920
<18-29,NIGEL WYNDHAM>晚上好
<18-29,NIGEL WYNDHAM>Good evening.

655
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,770
<18-29,NIGEL WYNDHAM>奈吉尔·温德姆  副总管
<18-29,NIGEL WYNDHAM>Nigel Wyndham. Deputy general.

656
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,060
<18-30,BECKETT>简恩·哈灵顿
<18-30,BECKETT>Jean Harrington.

657
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:02,970
<18-30,BECKETT>无聊啊
<18-30,BECKETT>Bored.

658
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,850
<18-31,WYNDHAM>那我们来找点乐子吧  哈灵顿小姐
<18-31,WYNDHAM>Well, we'll have to remedy that, Ms. Harrington.

659
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
<18-31,WYNDHAM>给这位女士一杯酒
<18-31,WYNDHAM>Uh, one for the lady, please.

660
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,130
<18-32,BECKETT>你结婚了  真扫兴
<18-32,BECKETT>Oh, a ring. That's discouraging.

661
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,740
<18-32,BECKETT>没必要扫兴
<18-32,BECKETT>Oh, well, it needn't be.

662
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,410
<18-33,WYNDHAM>为新友谊干杯
<18-33,WYNDHAM>To new friendships.

663
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,690
<18-34,WYNDHAM>哈灵顿女士  你是独自一人来的吗
<18-34,WYNDHAM>Now tell me, Ms. Harrington, are you here alone?

664
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,600
<18-34,WYNDHAM>如果是的话  真是天理难容
<18-34,WYNDHAM>If so, it would be a grave injustice.

665
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,690
<18-35,BECKETT>我的伴侣比起我更喜欢社交
<18-35,BECKETT>My date's more interested in networking than he is in me.

666
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,480
<18-36,WYNDHAM>那么我想他不会介意
<18-36,WYNDHAM>In that case, he won't object

667
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,200
<18-36,WYNDHAM>我请你跳舞吧
<18-36,WYNDHAM>if I ask you for a dance.

668
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,730
<18-37,BECKETT>你知道吗
<18-37,BECKETT>You know what?

669
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,780
<18-37,BECKETT>就算他介意我也不管
<18-37,BECKETT>I wouldn't care even if he did.

670
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,770
<18-38,WYNDHAM>那我们来吧
<18-38,WYNDHAM>Shall we?

671
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,030
<18-39,BECKETT>跟我说说  哈灵顿女士
<18-39,BECKETT>So... tell me, Ms. Harrington,

672
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,140
<18-40,WYNDHAM>你是个什么样的人
<18-40,WYNDHAM>What should I know about you?

673
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,910
<18-41,BECKETT>光关注眼前所见的可不够哦
<18-41,BECKETT>Well, there's more to me than meets the eye.

674
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,820
<18-42,WYNDHAM>眼前所见的
<18-42,WYNDHAM>Well, what meets the eye

675
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,820
<18-42,WYNDHAM>真是让人难以抗拒
<18-42,WYNDHAM>is irresistible.

676
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,840
<18-43,BECKETT>知道吗  行动胜于空谈
<18-43,BECKETT>You know, actions speak louder than words.

677
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,720
<18-44,WYNDHAM>什么意思
<18-44,WYNDHAM>Meaning?

678
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,190
<18-45,BECKETT>我是说  如果真是难以抗拒
<18-45,BECKETT>Meaning, if I'm so irresistible,

679
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,940
<18-45,BECKETT>那你为何不用两只手跳舞呢
<18-45,BECKETT>then why aren't you using both your hands?

680
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,250
<18-46,HUNT>失陪了  阁下
<18-46,HUNT>Excuse me, your excellency.

681
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,280
<18-47,HUNT>对不起  借过
<18-47,HUNT>Oh, excuse me. Pardon me.

682
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,300
<18-47,HUNT>借过一下
<18-47,HUNT>Coming through.

683
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,710
<18-48,HUNT>-对不起  先生  别动  - 真鲁莽
<18-48,HUNT>- Sorry, sir. As you were. -  Very rude!

684
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,400
<18-47,HUNT>借过
<18-47,HUNT>Excuse me. Oh. Oh!

685
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,770
<18-48,HUNT>借过
<18-48,HUNT>Excuse me.

686
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,300
<18-49,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>您是阿尔弗雷德·希斯爵士吗
<18-49,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>Sir Alfred Heath?

687
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,250
<18-50,HUNT>是的
<18-50,HUNT>Yes.

688
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,820
<18-51,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>能借一步说话吗  先生
<18-51,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>Might I have a word, sir?

689
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,070
<18-51,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>今晚似乎真假爵士都出席了
<18-51,SECURITY MAN BRYSON>There seems to be two of you here this evening.

690
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,940
<18-52,BECKETT>我不得不问
<18-52,BECKETT>I-I have to ask,

691
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,020
<18-53,WYNDHAM>你在做其他事情时也像在舞池
<18-53,WYNDHAM>Are you as aggressive in your other activities

692
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,440
<18-53,WYNDHAM>一样主动吗
<18-53,WYNDHAM>as you are on the dance floor?

693
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,100
<18-54,BECKETT>怎么说呢
<18-54,BECKETT>Ah, you know, what can I say?

694
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,200
<18-54,BECKETT>我总是喜欢掌控局面
<18-54,BECKETT>I like to lead... all the time.

695
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,610
<18-54,BECKETT>你们一定弄错了
<18-54,BECKETT>Well, there's obviously been a serious mistake.

696
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,620
<18-55,WYNDHAM>我真是阿尔弗雷德爵士
<18-55,WYNDHAM>I am the real Sir Alfred,

697
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,030
<18-55,WYNDHAM>一切都好吗
<18-55,WYNDHAM>Is--is everything all right?

698
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,250
<18-56,BECKETT>是的  只是我突然...
<18-56,BECKETT>Um, yeah. You know, I'm suddenly--

699
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,890
<18-56,BECKETT>突然觉得很饿  不好意思
<18-56,BECKETT>I feel very hungry. Excuse me.

700
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,300
<18-57,BECKETT>你想尝一口吗  听说很美味
<18-57,BECKETT>Would you like one of these? I hear they're great.

701
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,140
<18-58,WYNDHAM>我不大喜欢鱼子酱
<18-58,WYNDHAM>I'm not a caviar man myself.

702
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,050
<18-59,BECKETT>这样啊  不过我听说它们可以激发欲望的
<18-59,BECKETT>Yeah, but I hear they're an aphrodisiac.

703
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,460
<18-60,WYNDHAM>对我没啥用  我恐怕
<18-60,WYNDHAM>Mm. Not for me, I'm afraid.

704
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,420
<18-61,SECURITY GUY BRYSON>抱歉打断二位  温德姆先生
<18-61,SECURITY GUY BRYSON>I'm sorry to intrude, Mr. Wyndham, sir.

705
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,500
<18-62,WYNDHAM>什么事  布莱森
<18-62,WYNDHAM>Yes, what is it, Bryson?

706
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,710
<18-63,SECURITY GUY BRYSON>这位年轻女士  我需要她跟我们走一趟
<18-63,SECURITY GUY BRYSON>Uh, the young lady, I need her to come with me.

707
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,520
<18-64,WYNDHAM>为什么
<18-64,WYNDHAM>Well, for what purpose?

708
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,790
<18-65,BECKETT>别担心  亲爱的
<18-65,BECKETT>Don't worry, darling.

709
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,970
<18-65,BECKETT>我们能很快重逢的
<18-65,BECKETT>I know that we'll see each other again very soon.

710
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,890
<19-1,HUNT>我本盯住那侍者了  结果跟丢了
<19-1,HUNT>I had the waiter, then I lost him.

711
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,930
<19-1,HUNT>我把整个计划毁了
<19-1,HUNT>I've bollixed up the whole plan,

712
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,870
<19-1,HUNT>现在我们一无所获
<19-1,HUNT>and now we've got nothing.

713
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,040
<19-2,BECKETT>我可不会这么说
<19-2,BECKETT>Oh, I wouldn't say nothing.

714
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,730
<19-2,BECKETT>我偷来了温德姆的卡套
<19-2,BECKETT>I swiped Wyndham's card case.

715
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,930
<19-2,BECKETT>上面布满他的指纹
<19-2,BECKETT>It's got his prints all over it.

716
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,450
<19-3,HUNT>你真是个狡猾的小偷
<19-3,HUNT>You sneaky little thief.

717
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,290
<19-3,HUNT>太他妈聪明了
<19-3,HUNT>That's bloody brilliant.

718
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,340
<19-4,BECKETT>多谢夸奖  现在去让这混蛋显形吧
<19-4,BECKETT>Thank you. Now let's go get this son of a bitch.

719
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,950
<20-1,ESPOSITO>指纹比对不上
<20-1,ESPOSITO>The print's not a match.

720
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,870
<20-2,BECKETT>说啥
<20-2,BECKETT>What?

721
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,360
<20-4,ESPOSITO>鉴证组鉴定了卡套上的指纹
<20-4,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. ran the fingerprints off the card case,

722
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,910
<20-4,ESPOSITO>拿它与蕾妮在娜奥米尸体上发现的指纹比对
<20-4,ESPOSITO>compared 'em to the one that Lanie found on Naomi's body.

723
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,210
<20-4,ESPOSITO>那指纹不是奈吉尔·温德姆的
<20-4,ESPOSITO>It wasn't Nigel Wyndham's.

724
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,290
<20-5,BECKETT>这不可能  再去查一遍
<20-5,BECKETT>No, that's not possible. Run it again.

725
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,470
<20-6,ESPOSITO>莱恩已经反复查过三遍了
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Ryan already did that three times.

726
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,700
<20-6,ESPOSITO>温德姆不是凶手
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Wyndham's not our killer.

727
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,800
<20-7,HUNT>他肯定脱不了干系  我很清楚
<20-7,HUNT>He's behind this. I know it.

728
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,530
<20-7,HUNT>所以娜奥米才给我们留下他的照片
<20-7,HUNT>It's why Naomi left us his photograph.

729
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,990
<20-8,BECKETT>也许他雇佣了某人来替他做杀人的勾当
<20-8,BECKETT>Well, maybe he hired someone to do his dirty work for him.

730
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,170
<20-9,HUNT>比如他的安保人员
<20-9,HUNT>Like one of his security men.

731
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,910
<20-10,BECKETT>你能让苏格兰场的同事查查
<20-10,BECKETT>Can you get Scotland Yard to run background checks

732
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,790
<20-10,BECKETT>他安保人员的底细吗
<20-10,BECKETT>on the security staff?

733
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:47,630
<20-11,CASTLE>或许更好方法是从娜奥米在照片背面
<20-11,CASTLE>Or a better path might be to look into this mysterious number

734
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,280
<20-11,CASTLE>留下的神秘数字入手
<20-11,CASTLE>that Naomi wrote on the back of that photo,

735
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,130
<20-11,CASTLE>这个谜团已经被解开了
<20-11,CASTLE>Which is a mystery, no longer.

736
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,500
<20-12,ESPOSITO>这是龙虾吗  老兄
<20-12,ESPOSITO>Is this lobster, bro?

737
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,090
<20-13,CASTLE>算你走运  贾辛达胃口很小
<20-13,CASTLE>Lucky for you, Jacinda's a light eater.

738
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,120
<20-13,CASTLE>把它加热一下  再配上点黄油酱...
<20-13,CASTLE>You heat that up, little bit of melted butter--

739
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,210
<20-14,HUNT>你是说你知道那串数字的含义吗  怎么知道的
<20-14,HUNT>Are you telling us you know what that number means? How?

740
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,880
<20-15,CASTLE>当我和贾辛达正在享用
<20-15,CASTLE>Well, as Jacinda and I were enjoying

741
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,450
<20-15,CASTLE>鲜美的缅因州龙虾大餐时
<20-15,CASTLE>our succulent lobsters from Maine,

742

<20-15,CASTLE>配上朴实而高雅的
<20-15,CASTLE>paired with an earthy

<20-15,CASTLE>yet elegant Pinot Noir from Sonoma Valley--

744
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,150
<20-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  说数字
<20-16,BECKETT>Castle, numbers.

745
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,690
<20-17,CASTLE>对  我们当时在查看文件
<20-17,CASTLE>Right. Well, we were going over the file.

746
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,230
<20-17,CASTLE>发现贾辛达竟然是个破案达人
<20-17,CASTLE>Turns out Jacinda's quite a little crime solver.

747
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,570
<20-18,BECKETT>你给那空姐看证据文件了
<20-18,BECKETT>You showed the stewardess the evidence file?

748
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,640
<20-18,BECKETT>没有
<20-18,BECKETT>No.

749
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,820
<20-19,CASTLE>我只是用手机拍了张照而已
<20-19,CASTLE>I took a picture of it with my phone.

750
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,150
<20-19,CASTLE>而且你应当称呼人家"飞机乘务员"
<20-19,CASTLE>And the preferred nomenclature is "Flight attendant."

751
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,660
<20-19,CASTLE>关键在于  这串代码
<20-19,CASTLE>The point is, this code refers to

752
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,680
<20-19,CASTLE>代表了一个外交邮包
<20-19,CASTLE>a diplomatic pouch.

753
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,650
<20-20,HUNT>你是怎么知道的
<20-20,HUNT>How do you know that?

754
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,290
<20-21,CASTLE>贾辛达认出了这个格式
<20-21,CASTLE>Jacinda recognized the format.

755
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,280
<20-21,CASTLE>而且她还告诉我最后三位数字
<20-21,CASTLE>Furthermore, she told me these last three digits

756
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,290
<20-21,CASTLE>代表了皇家东方航空
<20-21,CASTLE>are a reference code for Royal Eastern Airlines.

757
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,450
<20-22,ESPOSITO>说明那外交邮包就是通过该航空公司寄送的
<20-22,ESPOSITO>Which means the pouch was delivered on that airline.

758
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,190
<20-23,CASTLE>正是  "W4"代表了邮袋的尺寸
<20-23,CASTLE>Exactly. The "W4" refers to the size of the pouch,

759
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,610
<20-23,CASTLE>"1949"则是该物件在领事馆邮包的
<20-23,CASTLE>the "1949" indicates exactly which pouch it is

760
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,790
<20-23,CASTLE>序列编号
<20-23,CASTLE>in the consulate sequence.

761
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,500
<20-24,HUNT>作为副总管  奈吉尔签发所有的邮包
<20-24,HUNT>As the deputy general, Nigel signs for all the pouches.

762
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,820
<20-25,BECKETT>就是说这也许不是因为奈吉尔和娜奥米的
<20-25,BECKETT>So then maybe this wasn't about an affair gone wrong

763
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,120
<20-25,BECKETT>婚外情出了岔子
<20-25,BECKETT>between Nigel and Naomi.

764
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,950
<20-27,CASTLE>-这事关走私  -这样就说得通了
<20-27,CASTLE>- It's about smuggling. - Well, that makes a lot of sense.

765
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,190
<20-27,CASTLE>外交邮包是密封的  所含之物
<20-27,CASTLE>Diplomatic pouches are sealed and their contents

766
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,840
<20-27,CASTLE>免于运输局和海关检查
<20-27,CASTLE>bypass T.S.A. and customs inspections.

767
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,810
<20-28,HUNT>娜奥米一定是发现了温德姆的违法勾当
<20-28,HUNT>Naomi must have got on to what Wyndham was doing somehow.

768
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,030
<20-28,HUNT>我们得弄清那邮包里有什么
<20-28,HUNT>We need to know what was in that pouch.

769
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,790
<20-29,ESPOSITO>领事馆是绝不会告诉我们的
<20-29,ESPOSITO>The consulate's never gonna release that information.

770
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,140
<20-30,CASTLE>无需通过领事馆
<20-30,CASTLE>Oh, we don't have to worry about the consulate.

771
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,890
<20-30,CASTLE>航空公司有货运单的副本
<20-30,CASTLE>The airline keeps a copy of the waybill.

772
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,870
<20-31,BECKETT>联系航空公司  拿到那份货运单
<20-31,BECKETT>Get ahold of the airline. Let's get that waybill down here.

773
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,020
<20-32,ESPOSITO>莱恩  拿支笔
<20-32,ESPOSITO>Ryan, grab a pen.

774
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,340
<21-1,CASTLE>怎么了
<21-1,CASTLE>What?

775
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,950
<21-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能把警方的
<21-2,BECKETT>Castle, you can't just share

776
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,860
<21-2,BECKETT>保密信息泄露给外人
<21-2,BECKETT>confidential police information with an outsider.

777
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,180
<21-3,CASTLE>即使这助我们破案吗
<21-3,CASTLE>Even if it solves the case?

778
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,820
<21-3,CASTLE>她给了我们条线索
<21-3,CASTLE>I mean, she gave us a lead.

779
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,540
<21-3,CASTLE>比你在领事馆查到的信息更有价值
<21-3,CASTLE>That's more than you got at the consulate.

780
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,360
<21-4,BECKETT>那你这么做就可以了吗
<21-4,BECKETT>And that's supposed to make this all okay?

781
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,420
<21-5,CASTLE>贾辛达纯属好意  有什么大不了的
<21-5,CASTLE>Jacinda just wanted to help. What's the big deal?

782
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,750
<21-6,BECKETT>你不明白  对吗
<21-6,BECKETT>You don't get it, do you?

783
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,990
<21-7,CASTLE>我想我是不明白
<21-7,CASTLE>No, I guess I don't.

784
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,840
<21-8,BECKETT>我想你也不明白
<21-8,BECKETT>No, I gu-- I guess you don't.

785
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,680
<21-9,RYAN>我查到些线索  来看看
<21-9,RYAN>We found something you're gonna want to see.

786
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,380
<21-9,RYAN>航空公司把货运单传过来了
<21-9,RYAN>The airline e-mailed over the waybill.

787
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,190
<22-1,RYAN>与这个货号吻合的邮包
<22-1,RYAN>The pouch that matches our number

788
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,000
<22-1,RYAN>是一年前从英国领事馆寄出
<22-1,RYAN>was shipped from the British Consulate about a year ago.

789
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,890
<22-1,RYAN>从肯尼迪国际机场
<22-1,RYAN>It flew from J.F.K.

790
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,320
<22-1,RYAN>寄往达乌干达的坎帕拉[首都]
<22-1,RYAN>to Kampala, Uganda.

791
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,950
<22-2,HUNT>乌干达  这不会是巧合
<22-2,HUNT>Uganda? That can't be a coincidence.

792
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:02,940
<22-3,BECKETT>什么意思
<22-3,BECKETT>What do you mean?

793
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,950
<22-4,HUNT>娜奥米已故的男友  就是在乌干达遇害
<22-4,HUNT>Naomi's boyfriend, the one who died, he was killed in Uganda.

794
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,170
<22-5,BECKETT>知道是什么货物吗
<22-5,BECKETT>Any idea of what was being shipped?

795
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,000
<22-6,RYAN>只知道重达181斤
<22-6,RYAN>Uh, just that it weighed 200 pounds.

796
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,680
<22-7,BECKETT>对于邮包而言  这货不轻啊
<22-7,BECKETT>Well, that's awfully heavy for a pouch.

797
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,510
<22-8,CASTLE>外交邮包小到一个信封
<22-8,CASTLE>Well, a diplomatic pouch can be as small as an envelope

798
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,830
<22-8,CASTLE>大到货物集装箱都有
<22-8,CASTLE>or as big as a cargo container.

799
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,890
<22-9,ESPOSITO>不管是什么  每月寄送一次
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Whatever's being shipped, it's being sent out about once a month.

800
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,680
<22-9,ESPOSITO>我彻查了去年整年的航空货运单
<22-9,ESPOSITO>I just combed through airline waybills from the past year.

801
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,680
<22-9,ESPOSITO>还有十个同样重量的邮包
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Ten other pouches, all the same weight,

802
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,170
<22-9,ESPOSITO>都是从这里寄往乌干达
<22-9,ESPOSITO>were flown from here to Uganda.

803
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,630
<22-9,ESPOSITO>其中一件显示
<22-9,ESPOSITO>In fact, one of them is listed

804
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,770
<22-9,ESPOSITO>存放在肯尼迪国际机场的行李区
<22-9,ESPOSITO>as being in J.F.K.'s Secure Baggage Area.

805
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,630
<22-10,HUNT>你的意思是  其中一个邮包
<22-10,HUNT>You mean to say, one of those pouches

806
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,930
<22-10,HUNT>现在还在机场
<22-10,HUNT>is at the airport right now?

807
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,880
<22-11,CASTLE>弄清邮包里的货物
<22-11,CASTLE>Finding out what's in that pouch

808
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,150
<22-11,CASTLE>有助于我们找到杀死娜奥米的凶手
<22-11,CASTLE>could tell us who killed Naomi.

809
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,230
<22-12,BECKETT>对  可卡塞尔  我们没有管辖权
<22-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but we don't have any jurisdiction here, Castle.

810
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,860
<22-12,BECKETT>如果纽约警察擅自打开英国外交邮包的话
<22-12,BECKETT>If the NYPD tries to open up a British diplomatic pouch,

811
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,410
<22-12,BECKETT>很可能引发国际争端
<22-12,BECKETT>we could risk an international incident.

812
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,760
<22-13,HUNT>值得庆幸的是  我可不是纽约警察
<22-13,HUNT>Then it's a good thing I'm not NYPD.

813
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,040
<23-1,JFK GUARD MORGAN>晚上好
<23-1,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Good evening, sir.

814
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,860
<23-2,HUNT>我是国土安全局的鲍尔探员
<23-2,HUNT>I'm agent Bauer with Homeland Security.

815
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,160
<23-3,HUNT>我是来检查的
<23-3,HUNT>I'm here for the inspection.

816
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,950
<23-4,JFK GUARD MORGAN>没人通知我有任何检查
<23-4,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Nobody radioed me about any inspection.

817
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,190
<23-4,JFK GUARD MORGAN>当然没人通知你
<23-4,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Well, of course they didn't.

818
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,560
<23-5,HUNT>我们随机抽查以评估安保系统
<23-5,HUNT>We conduct random checks to assess security.

819
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,590
<23-5,HUNT>提前通知就与我们的目的相触了
<23-5,HUNT>Telling you we were coming kind of defeats the purpose.

820
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,240
<23-5,HUNT>我说的对吧
<23-5,HUNT>Am I right?

821
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,780
<23-5,HUNT>那就是泄露了天机
<23-5,HUNT>We'd be tipping our hand, showing our play book, so to speak.

822
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,260
<23-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>我在这个班点工作两年了
<23-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Two years, I've worked this shift,

823
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,490
<23-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>从没听说过什么
<23-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>and I've never heard of anything--

824
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,580
<23-7,HUNT>摩根对吧  我相信你这儿管理严格
<23-7,HUNT>Look, Morgan, is it? I'm sure you run a tight ship here.

825
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,770
<23-7,HUNT>所以如果里面没问题
<23-7,HUNT>So if things inside are secure,

826
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,750
<23-7,HUNT>我保证去跟你老板说
<23-7,HUNT>I'll make damn sure your bosses know about it,

827
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,440
<23-7,HUNT>这是给你脸上贴金
<23-7,HUNT>which will reflect well on you.

828
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,270
<23-7,HUNT>朋友  我们是一条船上的
<23-7,HUNT>We're all on the same team here, pal.

829
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,790
<23-8,JFK GUARD MORGAN>我得和我上司确认下
<23-8,JFK GUARD MORGAN>I gotta verify this with my supervisor.

830
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,390
<23-9,HUNT>好吧  请便
<23-9,HUNT>Yeah, you do that.

831
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,950
<23-10,HUNT>忽悠人  我越来越老练了
<23-10,HUNT>I'm getting more adept at faking my way past people.

832
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,670
<23-10,HUNT>肯定是熟能生巧
<23-10,HUNT>Must be all the practice.

833
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,530
<23-11,BECKETT>你在行李区了吗
<23-11,BECKETT>You're in the Baggage Area?

834
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,030
<23-12,HUNT>嗯  但我时间紧迫
<23-12,HUNT>Yeah, but I don't have much time.

835
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,610
<23-12,HUNT>在他发现我胡扯之前
<23-12,HUNT>Maybe a minute before the guy calls his supervisor

836
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,400
<23-12,HUNT>我还有一分钟
<23-12,HUNT>to check my story.

837
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,180
<23-13,BECKETT>根据货号对应信息
<23-13,BECKETT>All right, so based on the shipping code,

838
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,640
<23-13,BECKETT>你要找的邮包
<23-13,BECKETT>the pouch that you're looking for

839
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,040
<23-13,BECKETT>大概一米半长
<23-13,BECKETT>is about 5 feet long.

840
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,760
<23-14,HUNT>货运单有说是板条箱  军用提箱
<23-14,HUNT>Does the waybill say if it's a crate, a footlocker,

841
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,600
<23-14,HUNT>还是纸板箱什么的吗
<23-14,HUNT>cardboard box, what?

842
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,970
<23-15,ESPOSITO>抱歉兄弟  上面没有
<23-15,ESPOSITO>No, sorry, bro.

843
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,870
<23-16,RYAN>但它重达181斤
<23-16,RYAN>But it's 200 pounds,

844
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,130
<23-16,RYAN>肯定挺结实的
<23-16,RYAN>so it's gotta be something sturdy.

845
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,930
<23-17,HUNT>结实  好吧
<23-17,HUNT>Something sturdy. Right.

846
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,800
<23-18,HUNT>我找到了  是个板条箱
<23-18,HUNT>Here we go. I found it. It's a crate.

847
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,610
<24-2,CASTLE>鲍尔探员
<24-2,CASTLE>Agent Bauer!

848
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,280
<23-19,JFK GUARD MORGAN>请你出来
<23-19,JFK GUARD MORGAN>I need you to step outta there, please.

849
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,710
<24-1,RYAN>听起来情况不妙
<24-1,RYAN>Okay, that didn't sound good.

851
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,580
<24-2,CASTLE>说自己叫鲍尔  能不被拆穿吗
<24-2,CASTLE>Agent Bauer-- what did he expect?

852
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,620
<25-1,HUNT>我听到了
<25-1,HUNT>I heard that.

853
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,560
<25-2,HUNT>我就好
<25-2,HUNT>I've just about wrapped up here.

854
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,310
<25-3,JFK GUARD MORGAN>先生  我上司快来了
<25-3,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Sir, my supervisor will be here--

855
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,500
<25-3,JFK GUARD MORGAN>他会非常满意你的工作的  摩根
<25-3,JFK GUARD MORGAN>And he will be mighty pleased with your work, Morgan,

856
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,300
<25-4,HUNT>非常满意
<25-4,HUNT>Mighty pleased.

857
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,460
<25-4,HUNT>依我看  你努力程度堪比
<25-4,HUNT>It's clear to me that you've been working harder than a...

858
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,470
<25-4,HUNT>参加踢人比赛里的独腿龙
<25-4,HUNT>one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.

859
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,390
<25-5,JFK GUARD MORGAN>快点出来  我不会再重复了
<25-5,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Step outta there now, sir. I will not tell you again.

860
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,440
<25-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>喂
<25-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>Hello!

861
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,150
<25-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>你还在里面吗  喂
<25-6,JFK GUARD MORGAN>You there? Hello!

862
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,200
<25-7,HUNT>我的天啊
<25-7,HUNT>Bloody hell.

863
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,080
<25-8,BECKETT>板条箱里是什么
<25-8,BECKETT>What's in the crate?

864
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,420
<25-9,HUNT>是导弹
<25-9,HUNT>Missiles.

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,660
<26-1,HUNT>海关和国土安全局已将板条箱扣留
<26-1,HUNT>Customs and Homeland Security have impounded the crate,

867
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,370
<26-1,HUNT>国际刑警正赶往肯尼迪国际机场
<26-1,HUNT>and Interpol is on their way to J.F.K.

868
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,430
<26-2,BECKETT>你打算怎么解释私自打开外交邮包的事
<26-2,BECKETT>How did you explain opening the diplomatic pouch?

869
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,800
<26-3,HUNT>此时此刻大家对导弹更有兴趣
<26-3,HUNT>Well, everyone's more interested in the missiles at the moment,

870
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,680
<26-3,HUNT>但我猜是祸躲不过
<26-3,HUNT>but I expect I'll be in hot water at some point.

871
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,170
<26-4,CASTLE>那温德姆呢
<26-4,CASTLE>And where does this leave Wyndham?

872
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,820
<26-5,HUNT>毫发无伤
<26-5,HUNT>Untouched.

873
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,070
<26-6,ESPOSITO>怎么会  他在走私军火
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What do you mean untouched? He was smuggling weapons.

874
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,600
<26-7,HUNT>当然他们会对他进行盘问
<26-7,HUNT>Well, they'll have an inquiry, of course,

875
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,220
<26-7,HUNT>可他们不能证明他知道板条箱里是什么
<26-7,HUNT>but they can't prove he knew what was in the crate.

876
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,830
<26-8,BECKETT>而且鉴于我们非法打开板条箱
<26-8,BECKETT>And since we opened the crate illegally,

877
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,180
<26-8,BECKETT>它不能作为合法证据
<26-8,BECKETT>we won't be able to use it as evidence.

878
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,260
<26-9,HUNT>至少现在有点头绪了
<26-9,HUNT>At least it all starts to make sense now.

879
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,720
<26-9,HUNT>娜奥米想查出艾登被害的真正原因
<26-9,HUNT>Naomi was trying to solve Aiden's murder.

880
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,970
<26-10,RYAN>也就是娜奥米的男友艾登·米勒
<26-10,RYAN>That would be Naomi's boyfriend--Aiden Miller.

881
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,140
<26-10,RYAN>他随无国界医生在乌干达行医
<26-10,RYAN>He worked for Doctors Without Borders in Uganda

882
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,920
<26-10,RYAN>直到一年前他的直升飞机
<26-10,RYAN>until his helicopter was shot down

883
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,290
<26-10,RYAN>被游击部队击落
<26-10,RYAN>by guerilla forces a year ago.

884
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,100
<26-11,HUNT>英国政府对此进行调查
<26-11,HUNT>The British government launched an investigation,

885
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,130
<26-11,HUNT>但他们一直想不通叛军是如何弄到
<26-11,HUNT>but was never able to determine how the rebels acquired

886
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,940
<26-11,HUNT>防空导弹的
<26-11,HUNT>a stinger missile.

887
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,210
<26-12,CASTLE>现在我们知道是奈吉尔·温德姆提供的
<26-12,CASTLE>Which we now know came to them courtesy of Nigel Wyndham.

888
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,680
<26-13,BECKETT>但是奈吉尔不是那种
<26-13,BECKETT>Yeah, except Nigel's not the type

889
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,050
<26-13,BECKETT>会亲自去捣腾导弹或者杀人的人
<26-13,BECKETT>to get his hands dirty when it comes to missiles or murder.

890
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,100
<26-14,ESPOSITO>他肯定有个能获悉防空导弹情报的同伙
<26-14,ESPOSITO>He must have had a partner who had a line on those stingers.

891
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,810
<26-15,BECKETT>如果娜奥米开始查探走私的勾当
<26-15,BECKETT>And if Naomi started looking into the smuggling operation...

892
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,000
<26-16,HUNT>那就有可能是他的搭档杀死了她
<26-16,HUNT>Then perhaps it was the partner who got rid of her.

893
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,540
<26-17,RYAN>问题是  他的搭档是谁
<26-17,RYAN>So then the question is, who is this partner?

894
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,840
<26-18,CASTLE>娜奥米所做的每件事都是为了
<26-18,CASTLE>Everything Naomi did was about finding out

895
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,620
<26-18,CASTLE>查到谁提供了杀死她男友的军火
<26-18,CASTLE>who supplied the weapon that killed her boyfriend.

896
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,330
<26-18,CASTLE>这也是她不接模特工作的原因
<26-18,CASTLE>That's why she stopped taking modeling gigs.

897
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,780
<26-18,CASTLE>是她来纽约的原因
<26-18,CASTLE>That's why she came to New York. It's...

898
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,790
<26-18,CASTLE>或许是某个在外国特权派对
<26-18,CASTLE>Maybe there's someone on that list of attendees

899
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,390
<26-18,CASTLE>名单上的出席者
<26-18,CASTLE>for that, uh, foreign dignitary party.

900
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,730
<26-19,CASTLE>我是说一切都开始于几个月前她去伦敦的
<26-19,CASTLE>I mean, it all started when she booked that out of london

901
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:01,610
<26-19,CASTLE>那次模特工作
<26-19,CASTLE>A few months ago.

902
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,950
<26-20,HUNT>保罗·莫库兹
<26-20,HUNT>Paulo Makuzi.

903
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,250
<26-21,RYAN>他是谁
<26-21,RYAN>And who is he?

904
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,890
<26-22,HUNT>乌干达反叛军的一个首领
<26-22,HUNT>A leader of the rebel army in Uganda.

905
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,590
<26-23,BECKETT>娜奥米一定是在派对上听到了什么细节
<26-23,BECKETT>Naomi must have heard something at the party.

906
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,890
<26-23,BECKETT>才把她引到领事馆
<26-23,BECKETT>That's what led her to the consulate.

907
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,900
<26-24,ESPOSITO>跟奈吉尔的浪漫晚餐只是她为了从他办公室
<26-24,ESPOSITO>And that romantic dinner with Nigel was just part of her agenda

908
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,370
<26-24,ESPOSITO>拿到包裹号码的计划之一
<26-24,ESPOSITO>to get the pouch number from his office.

909
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,680
<26-25,CASTLE>那么她的调查只有
<26-25,CASTLE>So then there's just one piece

910
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,560
<26-25,CASTLE>一个细节解释不通了
<26-25,CASTLE>that doesn't fit in her investigation.

911
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,680
<26-25,CASTLE>她找斯林大佬干什么
<26-25,CASTLE>What was she doing with Biggie Slim?

912
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,960
<27-1,BECKETT>我要你仔细看看这张照片
<27-1,BECKETT>I want you to take a close look at this photo.

913
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,420
<27-1,BECKETT>我见过这张
<27-1,BECKETT>Yeah, I've seen this one.

914
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,160
<27-2,BIGGIE SLIM>狗仔队两周前拍到我和妮基·杰
<27-2,BIGGIE SLIM>Paparazzi caught me and Nicky Jay

915
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,720
<27-2,BIGGIE SLIM>从录音棚出来
<27-2,BIGGIE SLIM>coming out of the studio a couple weeks ago.

916
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,560
<27-3,BECKETT>那是妮基·杰的黑色SUV  是吗
<27-3,BECKETT>In fact, that is Nicky Jay's black s.U.V., isn't it?

917
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,050
<27-4,BIGGIE SLIM>是我斯林大佬买给她的
<27-4,BIGGIE SLIM>Bought by Biggie Slim himself.

918
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,570
<27-4,BIGGIE SLIM>供需关系嘛  她要我就给
<27-4,BIGGIE SLIM>Supply and demand. She demands, I gotta supply.

919
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,660
<27-5,BECKETT>有一件事我觉得很有趣
<27-5,BECKETT>You know, the thing that I find intriguing

920
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,730
<27-5,BECKETT>在你成为斯林大佬之前
<27-5,BECKETT>is that before you became Biggie Slim,

921
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,260
<27-5,BECKETT>你名叫达利斯·杨
<27-5,BECKETT>you're name was Darius Young,

922
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,370
<27-5,BECKETT>不过是个开办了几个没成功的网络公司的小人物
<27-5,BECKETT>best known for launching several failed internet start-ups.

923
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,580
<27-6,BIGGIE SLIM>都是陈年旧事了
<27-6,BIGGIE SLIM>Just a man ahead of my time.

924
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,040
<27-7,HUNT>美国证监会认为你是一个
<27-7,HUNT>Well, the S.E.C. thought you were a man

925
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,510
<27-7,HUNT>诈骗投资人的骗子
<27-7,HUNT>trying to fleece investors.

926
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,930
<27-8,BIGGIE SLIM>但是我从来没有被起诉
<27-8,BIGGIE SLIM>See, I was never charged for that.

927
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,280
<27-9,BECKETT>有一项投资
<27-9,BECKETT>One of your ventures,

928
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,690
<27-9,BECKETT>一个在英国的音乐分享网站
<27-9,BECKETT>a music sharing web site based in the U.K.,

929
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:58,560
<27-9,BECKETT>受到了英国政府的关注
<27-9,BECKETT>caught the attention of British authorities.

930
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,940
<27-9,BECKETT>在他们打算关闭网站的时候
<27-9,BECKETT>And when they tried to shut it down,

931
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,480
<27-9,BECKETT>一份替你说情的文件寄到了文化部长手中
<27-9,BECKETT>an aide to the minister of culture lobbied on your behalf.

932
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,070
<27-9,BECKETT>你知道提供帮助的人是谁吗
<27-9,BECKETT>And do you know who that aide was?

933
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,880
<27-9,BECKETT>奈吉尔·温德姆
<27-9,BECKETT>Nigel Wyndham.

934
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,980
<27-9,BECKETT>事实上这是
<27-9,BECKETT>In fact, this is Nigel

935
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,930
<27-9,BECKETT>奈吉尔从同一辆黑色SUV中走出来
<27-9,BECKETT>stepping out of the very same black S.U.V.

936
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,080
<27-10,BIGGIE SLIM>我觉得不是
<27-10,BIGGIE SLIM>No, I don't think so.

937
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,430
<27-11,BECKETT>你还是仔细看看吧
<27-11,BECKETT>Why don't you take a closer look?

938
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,630
<27-11,BECKETT>门上有着一样的定制条纹
<27-11,BECKETT>It's got the same custom pinstripes on the door.

939
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,370
<27-12,BIGGIE SLIM>肯定是别人的车  条纹一样罢了
<27-12,BIGGIE SLIM>It's just somebody else's truck with those stripes on there.

940
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,140
<27-13,HUNT>你的司机已经承认开车
<27-13,HUNT>Your driver already admitted that he drove you

941
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,780
<27-13,HUNT>送你去领事馆碰面
<27-13,HUNT>to this meeting outside the consulate.

942
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,180
<27-14,BECKETT>我们也知道你的表弟在服役
<27-14,BECKETT>We also know that your cousin is in the service--

943
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:29,970
<27-14,BECKETT>德鲁·哈里斯
<27-14,BECKETT>Drew Harris.

944
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,670
<27-15,HUNT>参谋军士  他在军械库任职
<27-15,HUNT>A staff sergeant. He works at an armory.

945
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,820
<27-15,HUNT>他提供了那些导弹
<27-15,HUNT>He supplied the missiles.

946
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,400
<27-16,BECKETT>你知道温德姆能
<27-16,BECKETT>You knew that Wyndham had access

947
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,980
<27-16,BECKETT>搞到外交包裹  你看到了机会
<27-16,BECKETT>to the diplomatic pouch, and you saw an opportunity.

948
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,120
<27-17,HUNT>供需关系
<27-17,HUNT>Supply and demand.

949
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,560
<27-18,BIGGIE SLIM>老兄  你们这都是臆测
<27-18,BIGGIE SLIM>That's a whole lot of speculation there, mate.

950
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,690
<27-19,BECKETT>不止我们发现了这件事
<27-19,BECKETT>Well, we weren't the only ones to put together the pieces.

951
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,130
<27-20,HUNT>娜奥米没有给你她的电话号码
<27-20,HUNT>Naomi wasn't giving you her phone number.

952
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,760
<27-20,HUNT>她在找证据
<27-20,HUNT>She was looking for evidence.

953
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,020
<27-21,BECKETT>当你意识到她就是被温德姆发现
<27-21,BECKETT>Once you realized that she was the same girl

954
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,290
<27-21,BECKETT>四处查探的女孩
<27-21,BECKETT>that Wyndham caught snooping,

955
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,870
<27-21,BECKETT>你跟踪她  并在旅馆杀了她
<27-21,BECKETT>You followed her to the motel and you killed her.

956
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:56,850
<27-22,BIGGIE SLIM>你们怎么证明呢
