<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>You are very beautiful, Nikki Heat.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,450
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>只可惜我现在得杀了你
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>It is too bad that I have to kill you now.

11
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,860
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>比你更丑的男人都试过  德拉格
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Uglier men than you have tried, Drago.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,510
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>你扇我巴掌
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>You have slapped me.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,450
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>我不会
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>I will not have--

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,260
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>玩洋娃娃呢
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Playing with dolls, are we?

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,600
<1-3,CASTLE>这些是人形公仔
<1-3,CASTLE>These are action figures.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,560
<1-4,MARTHA>我借他们来创作场景
<1-4,MARTHA>I am using them to envision a scene.

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,970
<1-5,CASTLE>我还欠编辑几章《冰冻之心》
<1-5,CASTLE>I owe a few chapters of "Frozen Heat" to my editor,

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,410
<1-5,CASTLE>但我一页都写不出
<1-5,CASTLE>and I've not been able to write a page.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,740
<1-6,MARTHA>也许和贝克特办件案子
<1-6,MARTHA>Maybe a case with Beckett might,

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,610
<1-6,MARTHA>就能激发灵感呢
<1-6,MARTHA>you know, spark something.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,830
<1-7,CASTLE>她在准备庭审
<1-7,CASTLE>She's prepping for a trial.

22
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,280
<1-7,CASTLE>是信件吗
<1-7,CASTLE>That the mail?

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,400
<1-8,MARTHA>对  谢天谢地阿丽克西斯
<1-8,MARTHA>Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank God Alexis is

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,450
<1-8,MARTHA>终于收到一些大学的回信了
<1-8,MARTHA>finally getting some college acceptance letters.

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,720
<1-8,MARTHA>她的朋友们几周前就陆陆续续收到了
<1-8,MARTHA>Her friends started getting them weeks ago.

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,090
<1-9,MARTHA>理查德·卡塞尔
<1-9,MARTHA>Richard Castle,

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,620
<1-9,MARTHA>你到底在玩什么把戏
<1-9,MARTHA>what on earth are you playing at?

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,100
<1-10,CASTLE>我不想让阿丽克西斯再经历
<1-10,CASTLE>I don't want Alexis to have to live through

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,760
<1-10,CASTLE>收到斯坦福大学拒信的噩梦了
<1-10,CASTLE>that Stanford rejection nightmare again.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,320
<1-10,CASTLE>所以我要藏着这些信
<1-10,CASTLE>So I'm holding the letters.

31
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,570
<1-10,CASTLE>这样一来  她一下子收齐这些信
<1-10,CASTLE>This way, she gets them all at once,

32
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,980
<1-10,CASTLE>有坏消息的同时也有好消息
<1-10,CASTLE>and she'll get all the good news with the bad.

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,270
<1-11,MARTHA>理查德  这是你有史以来最蠢的主意了
<1-11,MARTHA>Richard, that is the dumbest idea you've ever had.

34
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,670
<1-11,MARTHA>你得在她神经崩溃前
<1-11,MARTHA>Now you've got to give her these letters

35
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,620
<1-11,MARTHA>把这些信给她
<1-11,MARTHA>before she has a nervous breakdown.

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,360
<1-12,CASTLE>好啦  我会的
<1-12,CASTLE>Okay, I will. I will.

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,360
<1-12,CASTLE>不过你得承认
<1-12,CASTLE>Though you have to admit,

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,850
<1-12,CASTLE>看她神经崩溃挺有趣的
<1-12,CASTLE>watching her have a nervous breakdown is pretty funny.

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,840
<1-13,MARTHA>我才不这么认为呢
<1-13,MARTHA>Unlike yours.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,840
<1-13,MARTHA>你的写作怎么办
<1-13,MARTHA>Now what are we gonna do about your writing?

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,980
<1-14,CASTLE>不知道  我就是需要些  不同以往的东西
<1-14,CASTLE>Oh, I don't know. I just need something... different,

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,020
<1-14,CASTLE>新东西
<1-14,CASTLE>something new,

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,150
<1-14,CASTLE>比如说
<1-14,CASTLE>something like...

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,610
<1-14,CASTLE>头条新闻
<1-14,CASTLE>发现人头

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,710
<1-15,MARTHA>人头
<1-15,MARTHA>severed heads.

46
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,500
<1-15,MARTHA>人头
<1-15,MARTHA>Severed heads?

47
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,400
<1-16,NEWSCASTER>死者是在午夜之后被人枪杀的
<1-16,NEWSCASTER>The victim was found shot to death after midnight.

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,080
<1-16,NEWSCASTER>据警方称  他的包里装了三个人头
<1-16,NEWSCASTER>According to police, his bag contained three severed heads.

49
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,150
<1-17,NEWSCASTER>斯勒特警探  你能说说
<1-17,NEWSCASTER>Detective Slaughter, what can you tell us about--

50
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,540
<1-18,SLAUGHTER>趁我没开枪打爆你的摄像机  给我拿开
<1-18,SLAUGHTER>Get that camera out of my face before I put a bullet in it!

51
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,990
<1-19,CASTLE>妈
<1-19,CASTLE>Oh-ho, Mother,

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,450
<1-19,CASTLE>忘了人头吧
<1-19,CASTLE>forget severed heads.

53
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,920
<1-19,CASTLE>我想去认识这个人
<1-19,CASTLE>I want to meet that guy.

54
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,010
<1-20,MARTHA>亲爱的  你已经有缪斯了
<1-20,MARTHA>You already have a Muse, darling.

55
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,370
<1-21,CASTLE>没错  缪斯是用来激发灵感的
<1-21,CASTLE>Yes, well, Muses are to provide inspiration,

56
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,280
<1-21,CASTLE>但现在我完全没有受到激发
<1-21,CASTLE>and right now I ain't getting any.

57
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,280
<1-21,CASTLE>妮基·希特警探
<1-21,CASTLE>So Detective Nikki Heat,

<2-2,BECKETT>Hey. Castle, what are you doing here?

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,430
<2-3,CASTLE>就是几天没见你了
<2-3,CASTLE>I just haven't seen you in a few days.

63
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,010
<2-3,CASTLE>我觉得应该过来看看你怎么样了
<2-3,CASTLE>Thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing.

64
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,330
<2-3,CASTLE>谢谢  真贴心
<2-3,CASTLE>Thank you. That's so sweet.

65
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,080
<2-4,BECKETT>事实上我很好
<2-4,BECKETT>Um, I'm great, actually.

66
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,280
<2-4,BECKETT>庭审准备得很好
<2-4,BECKETT>The trial prep is going really well.

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,370
<2-4,BECKETT>我能准时下班回家
<2-4,BECKETT>I've been getting home at a decent hour, and...

70
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,950
<2-5,CASTLE>关于那个叫斯勒特的黑帮组警探
<2-5,CASTLE>Hey, listen, do you know anything about

71
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,930
<2-5,CASTLE>你都知道些什么
<2-5,CASTLE>this gang cop named Slaughter?

72
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,400
<2-6,BECKETT>人头凶案  你就是为此来的
<2-6,BECKETT>The severed-heads homicide, that's why you're here?

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,960
<2-6,BECKETT>不是
<2-6,BECKETT>Uh, no. I mean,

74
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,820
<2-7,CASTLE>只不过既然你忙着准备庭审
<2-7,CASTLE>just, since you're busy prepping for the trial,

75
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,720
<2-7,CASTLE>我就是想查查这个斯勒特的底
<2-7,CASTLE>I just thought I'd look into this Slaughter guy,

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,110
<2-7,CASTLE>大致了解一下这人  做为背景调查
<2-7,CASTLE>get a sense of who he is for the background research,

77
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,660
<2-7,CASTLE>就是  那个
<2-7,CASTLE>the-- the...

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,530
<2-8,BECKETT>除非你对此有问题
<2-8,BECKETT>Unless that's a problem.

79
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,040
<2-8,BECKETT>不  没问题
<2-8,BECKETT>No, not a problem.

80
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,600
<2-9,CASTLE>太好了  那我能在哪找到他呢
<2-9,CASTLE>Great. So where would I find him?

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,570
<2-10,BECKETT>尸体在哪就去哪呗
<2-10,BECKETT>Wherever the body is.

82
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,620
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>亲爱的  你还是承认吧
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>Darlin', you might as well confess.

83
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,860
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>我知道是你杀了他
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>I know you killed him

84
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,800
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>以便你我共度美好时光
<3-1,SLAUGHTER>so we could spend some quality time together.

85
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,340
<3-2,LAURA>即使你是地球上最后一个男人我也不会勾搭你
<3-2,LAURA>Not if you were the last man on earth.

86
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,140
<3-3,SLAUGHTER>别以为我会知难而退
<3-3,SLAUGHTER>Don't think I'm not up to the challenge.

87
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,040
<3-4,LAURA>不如跳过你的大男子幻想
<3-4,LAURA>How about we skip the macho fantasy,

88
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,350
<3-4,LAURA>我直接告诉你死因吧
<3-4,LAURA>and I just tell you cause of death?

89
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,790
<3-5,SLAUGHTER>让我猜猜  中弹而亡
<3-5,SLAUGHTER>Let me guess-- lead poisoning?

90
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,110
<3-6,LAURA>胸口三枪
<3-6,LAURA>Three shots to the chest.

91
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,480
<3-6,LAURA>最有可能是短时间内大量失血而死
<3-6,LAURA>Most likely died of blood loss within minutes.

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,690
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>我就知道格林奇终会躺在这儿
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>Always figured Glitch would end up on this table.

93
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,850
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>格林奇是他的绰号  因为他做事一团糟
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>Glitch-- it's his street name on account, he's such a screwup.

94
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,110
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>你帮我把子弹拿出来了吗
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>You fish the slugs out for me?

95
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,650
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>看见没  你果然爱我
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>Ah. See? You do love me.

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,470
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>我猜是点32的吧
<3-7,SLAUGHTER>.32s, I'm guessing.

97
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,350
<3-8,LAURA>-你在说子弹对吧  -没错
<3-8,LAURA>- You're talking about the bullets, right? - Yeah.

98
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,940
<3-10,CASTLE>你不问人头的事了吗
<3-10,CASTLE>Aren't you gonna ask about the heads?

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,910
<3-11,SLAUGHTER>-你是谁  -这位是卡塞尔
<3-11,SLAUGHTER>- Who the hell are you? - That's Castle.

100
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,100
<3-12,LAURA>他是作家  12分局的顾问
<3-12,LAURA>He's a writer, and he consults with the 12th.

101
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,190
<3-13,CASTLE>好奇怪  这些头都不新鲜
<3-13,CASTLE>It's weird. You can tell they aren't fresh.

102
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,490
<3-13,CASTLE>能闻出来  甲醛  还带有些许腐臭
<3-13,CASTLE>You can smell it-- formaldehyde with a soupcon of decay.

103
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,620
<3-13,CASTLE>从头发里的泥土看来
<3-13,CASTLE>Judging from the dirt in the hair,

104
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,390
<3-13,CASTLE>应该是死者挖出了尸体
<3-13,CASTLE>I'd say our victim dug the bodies up

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,390
<3-13,CASTLE>然后砍下了他们的头
<3-13,CASTLE>and then cut the heads off.

106
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,860
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>真厉害啊  夏洛克
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>No kidding, Sherlock.

107
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,740
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>我早派人去查看本地墓园了
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>I already got UNIS checking out the local cemeteries,

108
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,470
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>不过那也与你无关
<3-14,SLAUGHTER>not that it's any of your business.

109
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,100
<3-15,CASTLE>里克·卡塞尔  正如劳拉所说
<3-15,CASTLE>Rick Castle, and like Laura said,

110
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,620
<3-15,CASTLE>我和12分局的贝克特探长合作
<3-15,CASTLE>I work out of the 1-2 with Detective Beckett.

111
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,250
<3-15,CASTLE>是这样的
<3-15,CASTLE>Here's the thing--

112
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,300
<3-15,CASTLE>我希望能跟着你办这件案子
<3-15,CASTLE>I was hoping I could ride along with you on this one,

113
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,810
<3-15,CASTLE>就一两天
<3-15,CASTLE>just for a day or two.

114
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,900
<3-16,SLAUGHTER>-不行  -不行
<3-16,SLAUGHTER>- No. - No?

115
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,290
<3-17,CASTLE>我不需要有个作家在边上闲晃
<3-17,CASTLE>I need a writer hanging around

116
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,380
<3-18,SLAUGHTER>就像我不需要梅毒一样

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,620
<3-26,CASTLE>你暗示了
<3-26,CASTLE>It was implied.

127
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,780
<3-27,SLAUGHTER>我一个人办案
<3-27,SLAUGHTER>Look, I work alone.

128
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,340
<3-27,SLAUGHTER>你说什么都不会改变这一点的

132
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,040
<3-30,CASTLE>那我就欠你一个人情
<3-30,CASTLE>that would mean I would owe you one in return.

133
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,400
<3-31,SLAUGHTER>市长的朋友就是我的朋友
<3-31,SLAUGHTER>Well, any friend of the mayor is a friend of mine.

<4-11,SLAUGHTER>有尸体被砍下了头
<4-11,SLAUGHTER>Well, it involved cutting the heads off of dead guys.

158

<4-12,BRIAN>瞧不起他  你后果自负
<4-12,BRIAN>You disparage his memory at your peril.

166
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,080
<4-15,CASTLE>难怪他没透露点风声
<4-15,CASTLE>No wonder he didn't give us anything useful.

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,940
<4-16,SLAUGHTER>我也没抱希望
<4-16,SLAUGHTER>Never thought he would.

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,940
<4-17,CASTLE>你是说他会自己解决杀死格林奇的人
<4-17,CASTLE>You think he's gonna hunt down Glitch's killer himself.

170
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,530
<4-18,SLAUGHTER>没错  我们得跟着他

<6-11,SLAUGHTER>You packin'?

226
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,500
<6-12,CASTLE>带枪  我不是警察
<6-12,CASTLE>Packing? No, I'm not a cop.

227
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,860
<6-12,CASTLE>我的防弹衣上写着"作家"呢
<6-12,CASTLE>My vest says "Writer" On it.

<6-13,SLAUGHTER>Come on.

230
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,330
<6-14,CASTLE>那不是触犯了相关法规
<6-14,CASTLE>hey, hey, what about regulations?

231
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,680
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>你不是签了弃权证书吗
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>You signed a waiver, didn't you?

232
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,990
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>你走前门  我走后门
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>Okay, you take the front, I'll go in the back.

233
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,900
<6-16,CASTLE>等等  等等  我们该叫上后援吧
<6-16,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shouldn't we call for backup?

<6-17,SLAUGHTER>你还有写着"作家"的裙子吗
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>You got a skirt that says "Writer" on it, too?

<6-19,SLAUGHTER>纽约警局
<6-19,SLAUGHTER>N-Y-P-D!

239
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,600
<7-1,CASTLE>我是相关平民调查员  都不准动
<7-1,CASTLE>Associated civilian investigator. Nobody move.

240
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,030
<7-2,CASTLE>-把枪放下  人渣  -你叫我什么
<7-2,CASTLE>- Drop the gun, dirtbag! - What did you call me?

<8-1,KEVIN RYAN>我怎么听说卡塞尔
<8-1,KEVIN RYAN>What's this I hear about Castle

262
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,550
<8-1,KEVIN RYAN>和别的警察一起去查案了
<8-1,KEVIN RYAN>researching with another cop?

263
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,570
<8-2,BECKETT>你没有文件要填吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Don't you have some files to fill out?

264
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,550
<8-3,RYAN>我相信这只是阶段性而已  你也知道卡塞尔
<8-3,RYAN>I'm sure it's just a phase. You know Castle.

265
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,680
<8-3,RYAN>他可能是被断头案
<8-3,RYAN>He's probably caught up in the severed heads

266
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,640
<8-3,RYAN>和帮派啥的迷住了
<8-3,RYAN>and the rush of The Gangster Squad--

267
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,490
<8-4,BECKETT>我才不关心他
<8-4,BECKETT>I don't care what...

268
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,470
<8-4,BECKETT>他
<8-4,BECKETT>what...

269
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,680
<8-4,BECKETT>卷入了什么事  只要他
<8-4,BECKETT>he's wrapped up in just so long as he...

270
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,910
<8-4,BECKETT>别来
<8-4,BECKETT>stays out of my...

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,370
<8-4,BECKETT>烦我  谢了
<8-4,BECKETT>hair. Thanks.

272
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,870
<8-5,SLAUGHTER>暂时帮我看管一下
<8-5,SLAUGHTER>Hey, put him on ice for me, huh?

273
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,300
<8-6,BRIAN>希亚  肥水不留外人田  知道吗
<8-6,BRIAN>Shea, keep it in the family, huh?

274
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,420
<8-7,SLAUGHTER>-审讯室在哪儿  -就在那里  第一扇门
<8-7,SLAUGHTER>- Where's interrogation? - Right there. First door right there.

275
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,190
<8-9,SLAUGHTER>你给我过来
<8-9,SLAUGHTER>Come on, you.

276
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,660
<8-10,BECKETT>这是怎么回事
<8-10,BECKETT>What the hell happened?

277
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,480
<8-10,BECKETT>你真该看到那一幕
<8-10,BECKETT>Oh, you should have seen it.

278
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,170
<8-11,CASTLE>斯勒特先发制人  擒住了一个
<8-11,CASTLE>Slaughter got the drop on the one guy,

279
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,610
<8-11,CASTLE>可另一个想逃走
<8-11,CASTLE>but the other guy tried to make a break for it.

280
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,510
<8-11,CASTLE>我只得把他放倒
<8-11,CASTLE>I had to take his ass down.

281
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,560
<8-12,BECKETT>你干了什么  你开玩笑吧
<8-12,BECKETT>You what? Are you kidding me?

282
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,510
<8-12,BECKETT>你是个作家  卡塞尔  不是个警察
<8-12,BECKETT>You're a writer, Castle. Not a cop.

283
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,070
<8-13,CASTLE>我可以照顾好自己  是你从不给我机会
<8-13,CASTLE>Hey, I can take care of myself. You just never give me a chance.

284
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,700
<8-14,BECKETT>当然  因为我不想让你挂掉
<8-14,BECKETT>Yeah, because I'm not trying to get you killed.

285
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,740
<8-14,BECKETT>他要用我们的审讯室干什么
<8-14,BECKETT>And what is he doing using our box?

286
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,940
<8-15,CASTLE>是我请他来的
<8-15,CASTLE>Well, I invited him to.

287
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,360
<8-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你没这个资格
<8-16,BECKETT>Castle, that's not your place.

288
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,840
<8-17,CASTLE>我想你不会介意的  再说  斯勒特这种人
<8-17,CASTLE>I didn't think you'd mind. Besides, guys like Slaughter,

289
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,920
<8-17,CASTLE>他们总是从这个分局跳到那个分局
<8-17,CASTLE>they just float from precinct to precinct, you know?

290
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,380
<8-17,CASTLE>就像游牧者
<8-17,CASTLE>They're like nomads,

291
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,660
<8-17,CASTLE>在纽约市街头游荡
<8-17,CASTLE>wandering the streets of New York City,

292
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,980
<8-17,CASTLE>除暴安良  杀人无赦
<8-17,CASTLE>kicking ass and taking names,

293
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,040
<8-17,CASTLE>虽然这句话的本意不是如此
<8-17,CASTLE>which isn't the most original turn of phrase,

294
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,350
<8-17,CASTLE>但他真是了不起的人物
<8-17,CASTLE>but the character is so great.

295
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,890
<8-17,CASTLE>绝对能为下一本妮基·希特系列带来冲击
<8-17,CASTLE>It's really gonna help me shake up this next Nikki Heat book.

296
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,910
<8-18,BECKETT>没问题  只要你能活着把书写下来
<8-18,BECKETT>Yeah, sure, if you live long enough to actually write about it.

297
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,810
<9-1,SHAY>格林奇不是我杀的
<9-1,SHAY>I didn't kill Glitch.

298
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,080
<9-2,SLAUGHTER>那他父亲为什么去找你麻烦
<9-2,SLAUGHTER>Then why'd his father come after you?

299
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,980
<9-3,SHAY>我不知道  可你得说服他我是清白的
<9-3,SHAY>I don't know, but you gotta convince him that I'm innocent.

300
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,170
<9-3,SHAY>不  不是的
<9-3,SHAY>No, no, no, no.

301
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,880
<9-3,SHAY>是你得说服我
<9-3,SHAY>You gotta convince me

302
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,840
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>否则我就把你丢进拘留室
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>or I'm gonna park you in holding

303
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,840
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>坐山观虎斗
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>then sit back and marvel

304
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>布莱恩如何赤手空拳地
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>at how Brian removes your limbs

305
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,790
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>把你四肢拧下来
<9-4,SLAUGHTER>with his bare hands.

306
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,790
<9-5,SHAY>我昨晚在长岛我姐姐家
<9-5,SHAY>I was at my sister's house on Long Island last night.

307
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,260
<9-5,SHAY>你可以打电话去问她
<9-5,SHAY>You can call and ask her.

308
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,460
<9-6,CASTLE>那为什么布莱恩认为是你杀了他儿子
<9-6,CASTLE>So why does Brian think you killed his son?

309
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,850
<9-6,CASTLE>非要这样吗  希亚
<9-6,CASTLE>Really, Shea?

311
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,710
<9-7,CASTLE>要我再次上演"帅虎猛龙"的戏码吗
<9-7,CASTLE>Want me to bust out Jake and the Fatman again?

312
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
<9-8,SHAY>布莱恩听说我和格林奇起过争执
<9-8,SHAY>Brian heard me and Glitch had a falling out,

313
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,030
<9-8,SHAY>可我们并没有
<9-8,SHAY>but we didn't.

314
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,140
<9-8,SHAY>那只是
<9-8,SHAY>It's just...

315
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,610
<9-8,SHAY>芬恩·洛克让我们都离他远点
<9-8,SHAY>Finn Rourke told us all to stay away from him.

316
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,680
<9-9,SLAUGHTER>西部帮派的老大让你们排挤格林奇吗
<9-9,SLAUGHTER>The head of the Westies made you freeze Glitch out?

317
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,350
<9-9,SLAUGHTER>为什么
<9-9,SLAUGHTER>Why?

318
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,280
<9-10,SHAY>他上周又办砸了一项差事
<9-10,SHAY>He screwed up another job last week.

319
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,780
<9-10,SHAY>他因为汽油用光  就把一辆满载偷来的
<9-10,SHAY>He abandoned a truck full of stolen medical equipment

320
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,890
<9-10,SHAY>医疗器材的卡车丢在罗斯福路上了
<9-10,SHAY>on the F.D.R. after he ran out of gas.

321
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,060
<9-10,SHAY>芬恩不杀格林奇的唯一理由就是布莱恩了
<9-10,SHAY>The only reason finn didn't have Glitch killed was Brian,

322
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,610
<9-10,SHAY>因为他知道如果他儿子出了事
<9-10,SHAY>because he knew he was crazy enough

323
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,700
<9-10,SHAY>布莱恩是会疯狂到敢去追杀他
<9-10,SHAY>to go after him if anything happened to his kid.

324
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,590
<9-11,CASTLE>为什么格林奇会有一袋子人头
<9-11,CASTLE>Why did Glitch have a bag full of heads?

325
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,850
<9-12,SHAY>不知道
<9-12,SHAY>No clue.

326
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,560
<9-13,SLAUGHTER>你最后一次见到他是什么时候
<9-13,SLAUGHTER>When's the last time you saw him?

327
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,700
<9-14,SHAY>两天以前
<9-14,SHAY>Two days ago.

328
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,160
<9-14,SHAY>他说他要去干点什么
<9-14,SHAY>He said he was gonna do something

329
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,930
<9-14,SHAY>跟西部帮派和好
<9-14,SHAY>to get back in good with the Westies.

330
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,340
<9-15,CASTLE>他有说是什么事吗
<9-15,CASTLE>Did he say what it was?

331
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,900
<9-16,SHAY>没  我也没问
<9-16,SHAY>No, and I didn't ask.

332
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,670
<10-1,CASTLE>格林奇怎么会觉得砍下死人的头
<10-1,CASTLE>How could Glitch think that cutting the heads off dead bodies

333
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,220
<10-1,CASTLE>可以让他跟西部帮派和好呢
<10-1,CASTLE>would get him back in good with the Westies?

334
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:55,930
<10-2,SLAUGHTER>他不是什么有头脑的人
<10-2,SLAUGHTER>He wasn't a deep thinker.

335
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,890
<10-2,SLAUGHTER>我可不会费尽心思去找他的动机
<10-2,SLAUGHTER>I wouldn't knock myself out looking for motive.

336
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,820
<10-3,CASTLE>卡布奇诺
<10-3,CASTLE>Cappuccino?

337
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,860
<10-4,CASTLE>第四条规矩
<10-4,CASTLE>Rule four.

338
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:02,850
<10-5,UNIFORM>卡塞尔
<10-5,UNIFORM>Castle.

339
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:04,830
<10-6,CASTLE>太好了
<10-6,CASTLE>Perfect.

340

<10-6,CASTLE>谢谢  非常感谢
<10-6,CASTLE>Thank you. Thank you very much.

341
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,490
<10-7,UNIFORM>埃斯波西托说
<10-7,UNIFORM>Esposito said

342
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,660
<10-7,UNIFORM>你有东西要给他
<10-7,UNIFORM>you'd have something for him.

343
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,630
<10-7,UNIFORM>那个
<10-7,UNIFORM>Uh, that's...

344
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,630
<10-8,CASTLE>告诉他东西就到
<10-8,CASTLE>Tell him--tell him they're on their way.

345
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,990
<10-8,CASTLE>谢了
<10-8,CASTLE>Thank you.

346
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,860
<10-9,CASTLE>好了
<10-9,CASTLE>All right.

347
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,970
<10-9,CASTLE>看来那些人头的身份查到了
<10-9,CASTLE>Looks like we got I.D.s on our heads.

348
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,250
<10-9,CASTLE>三个人都是沟城帮的成员
<10-9,CASTLE>All three belong to members of the Trench Town Posse.

349
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,350
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>我靠  谜题解开了
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>Hot damn. Mystery solved.

350
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,610
<10-9,CASTLE>沟城帮
<10-9,CASTLE>Trench Town Posse,

351
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,100
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>牙买加帮派  掌管着布鲁克林到
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>Jamaican gang-- runs girls and drugs

352
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,220
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>布朗克斯的卖淫和毒品交易
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>from Brooklyn to the Bronx.

353
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,250
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>他们正和西部帮派为争夺
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>They're fighting a turf war with the Westies

354
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,360
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>莫萨高地的地盘而战
<10-10,SLAUGHTER>over the Morningside Heights.

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,790
<10-11,CASTLE>我猜格林奇是想用砍下西部帮派敌方的头
<10-11,CASTLE>I bet Glitch thought he could make his bones

356
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,660
<10-11,CASTLE>作为弥补过失的筹码
<10-11,CASTLE>by cutting the heads off of Westie enemies.

357
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
<10-11,CASTLE>我打赌他打算把这些头
<10-11,CASTLE>Bet he planned on putting those heads

358
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,200
<10-11,CASTLE>放在某些牙买加高层人士的床上
<10-11,CASTLE>in some high-ranking Jamaican beds.

359
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,860
<10-11,CASTLE>就像电影《教父》里的马头一样
<10-11,CASTLE>Like a horse's head, "The Godfather."

360
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,060
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>这是你说过的最蠢的话了
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, that's the stupidest thing you said yet,

361
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,110
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>蠢到连格林奇都会觉得是个好主意
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>and just dumb enough to seem smart to Glitch.

362
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,540
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>根据对他的了解  他肯定走漏了消息
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>And knowing that boy, he'd run his mouth,

363
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,420
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>牙买加人知道了这事  伏击了他
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>Jamaicans hear about it, and they ambush him.

364
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,100
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>快走
<10-12,SLAUGHTER>Come on.

365
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,100
<10-13,SLAUGHTER>我认识和牙买加人有关系的线人
<10-13,SLAUGHTER>I got a source on the street tied in with the Jamaicans.

366
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,270
<10-13,SLAUGHTER>他应该可以告诉我们情报
<10-13,SLAUGHTER>He'll be able to give us intel.

367
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,110
<10-14,CASTLE>我爱死这种快攻办案方式了
<10-14,CASTLE>I love this run-and-gun police work.

368
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,270
<10-14,CASTLE>你在生气
<10-14,CASTLE>You're upset.

369
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,100
<10-14,CASTLE>没有
<10-14,CASTLE>No.

370
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,320
<11-1,BECKETT>好吧  我是生气  行了吧
<11-1,BECKETT>Yes. Okay? Fine. Yes.

371
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,340
<11-1,BECKETT>我以为
<11-1,BECKETT>I thought that

372
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,930
<11-1,BECKETT>我俩之间变得更加亲密了
<11-1,BECKETT>the two of us were actually getting closer together,

373
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,940
<11-1,BECKETT>现在看起来他是在疏远我
<11-1,BECKETT>and now it seems like he's just pulling away.

374
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,730
<11-2,BURKE>你问过他原因吗
<11-2,BURKE>Have you asked him why?

375
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,170
<11-3,BECKETT>问过  他说
<11-3,BECKETT>Yes, and he said...

376
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,420
<11-3,BECKETT>"一切都很好"
<11-3,BECKETT>"Oh, everything is fine."

377
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,550
<11-4,BURKE>你为什么觉得不好呢
<11-4,BURKE>What makes you think it isn't?

378
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,910
<11-5,BECKETT>因为他的所作所为都太混账了
<11-5,BECKETT>Because he's acting like a complete jackass!

379
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,160
<11-5,BECKETT>他手挽着小妞出现在分局
<11-5,BECKETT>He shows up at the precinct with these bimbos hanging on his arm,

380
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,940
<11-5,BECKETT>现在他又围在其他警察身边
<11-5,BECKETT>And now he's running around with another cop.

381
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,340
<11-6,BURKE>那个其他警察是女性吗
<11-6,BURKE>Is this other cop a woman?

382
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,710
<11-6,BURKE>不  不  为什么...
<11-6,BURKE>No! No. Why...

383
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,350
<11-7,BECKETT>为什么这么问
<11-7,BECKETT>Why would you even ask that?

384
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,470
<11-7,BECKETT>这根本不是重点
<11-7,BECKETT>That's not even the point.

385
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,020
<11-7,BECKETT>重点是  我不明白为什么他要这么做
<11-7,BECKETT>The point is, I don't understand why he's acting like this.

386
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,000
<11-7,BECKETT>我是说  我做了什么呢
<11-7,BECKETT>I mean, what did I do?

387
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,730
<11-8,BURKE>也许  从他的视角来看
<11-8,BURKE>Well, maybe, from his point of view,

388
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,070
<11-8,BURKE>问题在于  你没做什么
<11-8,BURKE>The question is, what didn't you do?

389
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:51,940
<11-9,BECKETT>等等  什么
<11-9,BECKETT>Wait. What?

390
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,110
<11-9,BECKETT>什么意思
<11-9,BECKETT>W-what do you mean?

391
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,170
<11-10,BURKE>你中枪的时候  卡塞尔说他爱你
<11-10,BURKE>When you were shot, Castle said that he loved you.

392
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,640
<11-10,BURKE>那是多久前的事
<11-10,BURKE>How long ago was that?

393
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,500
<11-11,BECKETT>七个月前
<11-11,BECKETT>Seven months ago,

394
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,940
<11-11,BECKETT>可我那时没准备好听他说那句话
<11-11,BECKETT>but I wasn't ready to hear that then--

395
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,980
<11-12,BURKE>你觉得他用行动在告诉你什么
<11-12,BURKE>What do you think he's telling you with his behavior?

396
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,640
<11-13,BECKETT>也许是
<11-13,BECKETT>That maybe

397
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,760
<11-13,BECKETT>他已经不再等候了
<11-13,BECKETT>he's not there anymore?

398
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,380
<11-13,BECKETT>也许他还没准备好
<11-13,BECKETT>That maybe he's not ready?

399
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,070
<11-14,BECKETT>要是我等太久了呢
<11-14,BECKETT>What if I waited too long?

400
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,970
<11-15,BURKE>你不是在等  凯特  而是休养
<11-15,BURKE>You weren't waiting, Kate. You were healing.

401
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,240
<11-16,BECKETT>是的  可也许在这段时间
<11-16,BECKETT>Yeah, but then in the meantime,

402
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,320
<11-16,BECKETT>他向前看了
<11-16,BECKETT>he's moved on.

403
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,330
<11-17,BURKE>或者他在保护自己
<11-17,BURKE>Or he's protecting himself

404
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,750
<11-17,BURKE>不愿承担更多的感情风险
<11-17,BURKE>by not taking more emotional risks.

405
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,080
<11-18,BECKETT>那我该怎么办
<11-18,BECKETT>So then what do I do?

406
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,980
<11-19,BURKE>你想怎么办
<11-19,BURKE>What do you want to do?

407
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,870
<11-19,BURKE>要我就这么办
<11-19,BURKE>I tell you what I'd do,

408
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,400
<12-1,SLAUGHTER>我会对你的搭档暴露出原始野性
<12-1,SLAUGHTER>I'd go all caveman on that partner of yours.

409
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,350
<12-1,SLAUGHTER>让她看看什么才是真男人的作风
<12-1,SLAUGHTER>Show her what time it is in real-man land.

410
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,610
<12-2,CASTLE>真男人的作风
<12-2,CASTLE>Real-man land?

411
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,810
<12-3,SLAUGHTER>刚刚在停尸间
<12-3,SLAUGHTER>Oh, is that what you were showing Laura

412
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,790
<12-4,CASTLE>你展现给劳拉的那种吗
<12-4,CASTLE>when we were back at the morgue?

413
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,990
<12-5,SLAUGHTER>只是给她点关注
<12-5,SLAUGHTER>Just throw a little attention her way,

<12-5,SLAUGHTER>逗她开心

<14-3,RYAN>我觉得他背叛了我们
<14-3,RYAN>I feel like he's cheating on us.

<16-10,MAXY>到处说要把我们死去的朋友挖出来
<16-10,MAXY>was running his mouth about digging up our dead.

492

<16-10,MAXY>我去墓地伏击他
<16-10,MAXY>Me go out to the cemetery to ambush him,

493
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,740
<16-10,MAXY>但是我从没开过枪
<16-10,MAXY>but I never fire no shot!

494
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,410
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>你最好退后点
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>You better stand back.

495
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,140
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>这家伙会像颗葡萄那样炸开的
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>This guy's gonna pop like a grape.

496
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,010
<16-12,MAXY>不  等等  我发誓
<16-12,MAXY>No, wait! I swear!

497
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,810
<16-12,MAXY>他不是一个人  一群墨西哥人等在那里
<16-12,MAXY>He wasn't alone! A group of Mexicans was waiting there

498
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,450
<16-12,MAXY>靠着一辆豪华的卡迪拉克攀登
<16-12,MAXY>next to a tricked-out escalade!

499
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,460
<16-13,SLAUGHTER>你是说这事还涉及第三个帮派吗
<16-13,SLAUGHTER>Are you telling me a third gang is involved in this?

500
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,050
<16-14,MAXY>伙计  我不知道他们是谁  伙计
<16-14,MAXY>Man, I don't know who they are, man!

501
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,760
<16-14,MAXY>但格林奇显然是认识他们
<16-14,MAXY>But that Glitch clearly knew them!

502
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,690
<16-14,MAXY>他说他拿到头了  然后就突然出了乱子
<16-14,MAXY>He told 'em he had the heads, then things went south!

503
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,730
<16-14,MAXY>那些墨西哥人朝他开枪  然后就逃跑了
<16-14,MAXY>The Mexicans opened fire on him and took off running,

504
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,790
<16-15,CASTLE>-我也是  -好的  好的  好的
<16-15,CASTLE>- And so did I. - Okay, okay, okay,

505
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,420
<16-15,CASTLE>那么就是墨西哥人追到了格林奇
<16-15,CASTLE>So the Mexicans hunted down glitch,

506
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,020
<16-15,CASTLE>然后杀了他
<16-15,CASTLE>and they shot him.

507
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,870
<16-16,SLAUGHTER>或者就是他干的  还编故事骗我们
<16-16,SLAUGHTER>Or he did and he's making up a story.

508
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,660
<16-17,MAXY>不  不  不  我有证据
<16-17,MAXY>No, no, no, no, no! I can prove it!

509
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,760
<16-17,MAXY>那辆攀登上的是德克萨斯州牌照
<16-17,MAXY>The Escalade had Texas plates.

510
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,010
<16-17,MAXY>我看到了开头的两个字母  R和X
<16-17,MAXY>I saw the first two letters-- "R" And "X."

511
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,570
<16-17,MAXY>好吧  马克西
<16-17,MAXY>Okay, Maxi.

512
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,030
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>我们最好能查到这块牌照
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>But that license better check out,

513
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,120
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>不然我就回来收拾你这条小命
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>or I'm gonna come back here and recycle your ass.

514
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,500
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>能查到的  能查到的
<16-18,SLAUGHTER>It will check. It will check!

515
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,090
<16-19,SLAUGHTER>-我发誓  你们肯定能查到  -拜拜
<16-19,SLAUGHTER>- It'll check, man! I swear! - Bye-bye.

516
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,100
<16-20,MAXY>斯勒特  放我出去
<16-20,MAXY>Slaughter, get me out of here!

517
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,080
<16-21,CASTLE>还有个团伙  貌似蛮可信的  是吗
<16-21,CASTLE>Another gang. That's plausible, right?

518
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,720
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>没错
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>Yep.

519
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,280
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>你威胁过足够多的人
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>You threaten enough guys,

520
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,820
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>就能知道他们什么时候是说实话
<16-22,SLAUGHTER>you get a feel for their honesty.

521
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,530
<16-23,CASTLE>不过刚刚你不会真打算压扁他吧
<16-23,CASTLE>But you wouldn't have really crushed him?

522
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,420
<16-24,SLAUGHTER>当然不会啦
<16-24,SLAUGHTER>Nah, of course not.

523
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,410
<16-24,SLAUGHTER>更像是碾碎
<16-24,SLAUGHTER>It would've been more like a-a mangling.

524
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,390
<16-25,MAXY>斯勒特
<16-25,MAXY>Slaughter!

<17-3,RYAN>That's gonna be really tough for me.

<17-17,CASTLE>But nothing. But nothing.

550
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,540
<17-17,CASTLE>我们...庆祝去
<17-17,CASTLE>Let's... let's do this.

551
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,990
<17-17,CASTLE>庆祝还能出什么事  对不
<17-17,CASTLE>What's the worst that could happen, right?

552
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,460
<18-1,CASTLE>发生什么事了
<18-1,CASTLE>What happened?

553
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,270
<18-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>老爸  我进了  我进了
<18-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad, I got in. I got in!

<18-3,CASTLE>进什么了
<18-3,CASTLE>Oh, where?

555
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,520
<18-4,MARTHA>目前看来几乎哪都进了
<18-4,MARTHA>Almost everywhere so far.

556
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,560
<18-5,ALEXIS>牛津  普林斯顿  还有萨拉劳伦斯学院
<18-5,ALEXIS>Oxford, Princeton, Sarah Lawrence.

557
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,380
<18-6,CASTLE>太好了  亲爱的  我就知道你能行
<18-6,CASTLE>That's great, honey. I-I knew it would work out.

558
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,210
<18-7,ALEXIS>真的吗
<18-7,ALEXIS>Really?

559
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,890
<18-8,CASTLE>当然
<18-8,CASTLE>Yeah.

560
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,020
<18-9,ALEXIS>那你为什么还要把这些信藏起来
<18-9,ALEXIS>Then why were you hiding the letters from me?

561
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,170
<18-10,CASTLE>-什么  -拜托  老爸
<18-10,CASTLE>- What? - Come on, dad.

562
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,320
<18-11,ALEXIS>邮戳上写着呢  有些信上周就到了
<18-11,ALEXIS>I can read a postmark. Some of these came last week.

563
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,170
<18-12,CASTLE>我就是  对不起
<18-12,CASTLE>Oh. I just--I'm sorry.

564
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,900
<18-12,CASTLE>亲爱的  我怕你受伤而已
<18-12,CASTLE>Honey, I-I'm just trying to protect you.

565
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,840
<18-13,ALEXIS>我都十八岁了
<18-13,ALEXIS>I'm 18 now.

566
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,240
<18-13,ALEXIS>你得相信我  我能照顾好...
<18-13,ALEXIS>You need to trust that I can take care of my...

567
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,770
<18-14,CASTLE>自己
<18-14,CASTLE>myself.

568
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,140
<18-14,CASTLE>怎么了
<18-14,CASTLE>What?

569
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,550
<18-15,ALEXIS>我进了斯坦福大学
<18-15,ALEXIS>I got into Stanford.

570
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,590
<18-16,MARTHA>耶  太好了
<18-16,MARTHA>Yes! Oh, great!

571
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,200
<18-16,MARTHA>那不一直是你最向往的吗
<18-16,MARTHA>That's always been your first choice, right?

572
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,000
<18-17,CASTLE>可我怎么感觉你不太高兴
<18-17,CASTLE>And yet, I sense trouble.

573
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,590
<18-18,ALEXIS>我不知道
<18-18,ALEXIS>I-I don't know.

574
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,560
<18-18,ALEXIS>我应该高兴才对
<18-18,ALEXIS>I mean, I should be happy,

575
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,270
<18-18,ALEXIS>可他们拒绝了我提早录取的申请
<18-18,ALEXIS>but after they shot me down for early admission...

576
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,380
<18-19,CASTLE>他们当初没要你  你觉得遭到了背叛
<18-19,CASTLE>They rejected you, and you feel betrayed.

577
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,990
<18-20,ALEXIS>我该怎么跨过那道坎
<18-20,ALEXIS>How am I supposed to get over that?

578
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,560
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>你气色好差
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>You look like crap.

579
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,170
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>给你  解酒的  能让你恢复精神
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>Here. Little hair of the dog. That'll get you flying right.

580
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,530
<19-2,CASTLE>不用了  这也没法让时间倒流
<19-2,CASTLE>No. It's not gonna do anything to turn back time.

581
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,470
<19-2,CASTLE>我们究竟要去哪
<19-2,CASTLE>Anyway, where are we going?

582
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,190
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>布朗克斯的修理厂
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>Salvage yard in the Bronx.

583
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,680
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>昨晚我自己查了那个德克萨斯州的牌照
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>I ran that Texas plate myself last night.

584
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,250
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>马克西说有第三方介入的事确实是真的
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>Turns out Maxi was telling the truth about the third player.

585
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,590
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>那辆攀登登记在一个叫凯撒·威勒斯的人名下
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>Escalade was registered to a Cesar Vales.

586
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,280
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>他是一个墨西哥帮派的
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>Runs with a Mexican gang.

587
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,740
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>据说他们想入侵纽约的地盘
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>Rumor has it they're making inroads into New York,

588
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,940
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>垄断这里的毒品市场
<19-3,SLAUGHTER>trying to corner the market on the city's crank trade.

589
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,720
<19-4,CASTLE>于是威勒斯跑来这儿想跟
<19-4,CASTLE>So Vales is coming into town trying to muscle in

590
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,750
<19-4,CASTLE>西部帮派和牙买加人抢地盘
<19-4,CASTLE>on the Westies and the Jamaicans.

591
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,560
<19-5,SLAUGHTER>是啊  这可不容易
<19-5,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, which ain't exactly easy to do.

592
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,310
<19-6,CASTLE>如果他能让这两者互斗
<19-6,CASTLE>Well, it would be a lot easier

593
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,200
<19-6,CASTLE>那就容易得多了
<19-6,CASTLE>if he could get them to take each other out.

594
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,570
<19-6,CASTLE>不错嘛
<19-6,CASTLE>That's good.

595
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,110
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>于是他想方设法
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>So he's sitting around

596
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,220
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>让西部帮派和牙买加人发生冲突
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>trying to think about a way to make that happen,

597
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,150
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>听到了格林奇的夸夸其谈
<19-7,SLAUGHTER>and he overhears Glitch running his mouth.

598
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,780
<19-8,CASTLE>没错  他意识到  如果西部帮派有人被杀
<19-8,CASTLE>Right, he realizes, if a Westie was to turn up murdered

599
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,130
<19-8,CASTLE>还带着一袋子牙买加人的人头
<19-8,CASTLE>with a bag full of Jamaican heads,

600
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,370
<19-8,CASTLE>双方必然开战
<19-8,CASTLE>both sides would go to war.

601
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,900
<19-9,SLAUGHTER>他们便能坐收渔翁之利
<19-9,SLAUGHTER>And they could jump in and take over their territories.

602
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,780
<19-10,CASTLE>你确定我们就这样自己去找他合适吗
<19-10,CASTLE>Are you sure it's such a good idea to go after this guy ourselves?

603
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,220
<19-10,CASTLE>听马克西的口气  那帮人挺危险的
<19-10,CASTLE>I mean, Maxi made 'em sound pretty dangerous.

604
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,550
<19-11,SLAUGHTER>小菜一碟
<19-11,SLAUGHTER>Piece of cake.

605
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,430
<19-11,SLAUGHTER>那家伙就是个不入流的废物而已
<19-11,SLAUGHTER>Guy's nothing but a two-bit punk.

606
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,550
<20-1,RYAN>他是墨西哥黑手党的高层人物
<20-1,RYAN>He's high-level Mexican Mafia.

607
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,440
<20-1,RYAN>非常危险
<20-1,RYAN>About as dangerous as they come.

608
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,650
<20-1,RYAN>缉毒局报告称  凯撒·威勒斯涉嫌
<20-1,RYAN>According to the D.E.A., Cesar Vales is suspected

609
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,040
<20-1,RYAN>十几起杀人案
<20-1,RYAN>in the deaths of over a dozen people,

610
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,930
<20-1,RYAN>其中包括三名墨西哥警察
<20-1,RYAN>including three cops in Mexico

611
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,100
<20-1,RYAN>被人用大锤砸死  还被碎了尸
<20-1,RYAN>who were killed with a sledgehammer and then cut up into pieces.

612
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,170
<20-2,ESPOSITO>你说卡塞尔不会和斯勒特去找这个人了吧
<20-2,ESPOSITO>You don't think Castle and Slaughter are going after him?

613
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,990
<20-3,RYAN>恐怕就是这样
<20-3,RYAN>I'd put money on it,

614
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,840
<20-3,RYAN>因为昨晚不止我一个人查了他的牌照
<20-3,RYAN>'cause I wasn't the only one who ran his plates last night.

615
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,380
<20-3,RYAN>斯勒特也查了
<20-3,RYAN>Slaughter did, too.

616
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,970
<20-4,ESPOSITO>如果卡塞尔和斯勒特去找这家伙
<20-4,ESPOSITO>If Castle and Slaughter go after this guy,

617
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,890
<20-4,ESPOSITO>他们都会被干掉的
<20-4,ESPOSITO>they're gonna both end up dead.

618
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,890
<20-4,ESPOSITO>-我们得警告卡塞尔  -我试过了
<20-4,ESPOSITO>- We need to warn Castle. - I tried,

619
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,320
<20-5,RYAN>给打他的电话都转到了语音信箱里
<20-5,RYAN>but his phone keeps going to voice mail.

620
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,380
<20-5,RYAN>我有种不好的预感
<20-5,RYAN>I got a bad feeling that

621
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,630
<20-5,RYAN>他们正在去抓威勒斯的路上
<20-5,RYAN>they're on their way to take down Vales right now.

622
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,510
<21-1,CASTLE>你今天不会把谁碾碎吧
<21-1,CASTLE>You're not gonna mangle anyone today, are you?

623
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,290
<21-2,SLAUGHTER>看看再说吧
<21-2,SLAUGHTER>I like to keep my options open.

624
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,510
<21-3,CASTLE>对方人好多
<21-3,CASTLE>There's an awful lot of 'em.

625
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,790
<21-4,SLAUGHTER>跟着我就行了
<21-4,SLAUGHTER>Just follow my lead.

626
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,720

<21-5,SLAUGHTER>Unless you want your friends to see

<21-6,CESER VALES>Wow. Now what seems to be the problem, officer?

633
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,950
<21-7,SLAUGHTER>你是威勒斯
<21-7,SLAUGHTER>You Vales?

<21-9,SLAUGHTER>A.K.A. Glitch.

637
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,820
<21-10,VALES>没什么意义
<21-10,VALES>No. I'm afraid not.

638
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,260
<21-11,SLAUGHTER>那可有意思了  因为有人看到
<21-11,SLAUGHTER>That's funny, 'cause I got an eyewitness

639
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,590
<21-11,SLAUGHTER>你和你的娘们

<21-11,SLAUGHTER>两晚前在皇后区向他开枪
<21-11,SLAUGHTER>shooting the hell outta him in Queens two nights ago.

641
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,690
<21-12,VALES>那可真有趣
<21-12,VALES>That is funny.

<21-13,SLAUGHTER>In his other coat.

644
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,000
<21-15,SLAUGHTER>威勒斯  我们已经了解你的计划了
<21-15,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, Vales, we know all about your plan.

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,890
<21-16,SLAUGHTER>利用格林奇来引发帮派斗争
<21-16,SLAUGHTER>Use Glitch to spark a gang war

646
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,020
<21-16,SLAUGHTER>这样你就能把自己的毒品生意搬到纽约了
<21-16,SLAUGHTER>so you could move your drug business into New York.

647
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,420

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,950
<21-22,ESPOSITO>派对结束了
<21-22,ESPOSITO>The party's over.

654
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,840
<21-23,VALES>太遗憾了  才刚刚开始有点意思
<21-23,VALES>That's too bad, because this was just getting interesting.

655
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,500
<21-24,SLAUGHTER>我要是你  就把事情都安排妥当
<21-24,SLAUGHTER>If I were you, I'd get your affairs in order,

656
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,390
<21-24,SLAUGHTER>因为我还会回来的
<21-24,SLAUGHTER>'cause I'll be back.

657
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,750
<21-25,ESPOSITO>斯勒特
<21-25,ESPOSITO>Hey! Slaughter.

658
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,430
<21-25,ESPOSITO>像那样没有后援就冲进去
<21-25,ESPOSITO>Going in there like that without backup,

659
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,740
<21-25,ESPOSITO>把平民百姓陷于危险之中
<21-25,ESPOSITO>putting a civilian in harm's way,

660
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,080
<21-25,ESPOSITO>那不只鲁莽  还是警察失职
<21-25,ESPOSITO>that's not only reckless, that is bad police work.

661
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,630
<21-26,RYAN>你该庆幸我们追踪到卡塞尔的手机
<21-26,RYAN>You're just lucky that we traced Castle's phone

662
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,280
<21-26,RYAN>及时找到了你们
<21-26,RYAN>and we found you guys in time.

663
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,850
<21-27,SLAUGHTER>你以为我会感谢你们几乎毁了我的计划吗
<21-27,SLAUGHTER>What, you think I'm gonna thank you for almost ruining my play?

664
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,000
<21-28,CASTLE>你还有计划
<21-28,CASTLE>You had a play?

665
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,610
<21-29,SLAUGHTER>我总有计划  得让事情升级
<21-29,SLAUGHTER>I always have a play. Had to escalate things.

666
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,820
<21-29,SLAUGHTER>这样我就能找出他们当中的弱者了
<21-29,SLAUGHTER>That way I could find the weak member of the herd.

667
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,690
<21-30,CASTLE>那个孩子
<21-30,CASTLE>That kid.

668
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,960
<21-30,CASTLE>没错
<21-30,CASTLE>Exactly.

669
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,520
<21-31,SLAUGHTER>我们就要靠他扳倒威勒斯
<21-31,SLAUGHTER>He's the one I'm gonna get to flip on Vales

670
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,210
<21-31,SLAUGHTER>只需想办法把他单独找出来
<21-31,SLAUGHTER>once I figure out how to separate him from the pack.

671
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,310
<22-1,RYAN>我们一起工作这么些年
<22-1,RYAN>Who knew all these years we've been working together

672
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,240
<22-1,RYAN>还不知你有意求死
<22-1,RYAN>that you had a death wish?

673
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,840
<22-2,CASTLE>那个吗  那没什么不好
<22-2,CASTLE>Come on, that? That wasn't bad.

674
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,400
<22-2,CASTLE>斯勒特有个计划
<22-2,CASTLE>Slaughter had a plan.

675
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,790
<22-3,RYAN>是啊  他的计划就是害死你
<22-3,RYAN>Yeah, he had a plan to get you killed.

677
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,070
<22-3,RYAN>是斯勒特
<22-3,RYAN>It's slaughter.

678
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,700
<22-4,CASTLE>我得走了
<22-4,CASTLE>I gotta go.

679
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,720
<22-4,CASTLE>好吧
<22-4,CASTLE>All right.

680
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,770
<22-5,RYAN>下次我们可能就不会去救你了
<22-5,RYAN>Next time, we might not be there to save you.

681
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,420
<22-6,ESPOSITO>你得做点什么
<22-6,ESPOSITO>You need to do something.

682
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,380
<22-7,BECKETT>埃斯波  如果一个人拼命想离开巢穴
<22-7,BECKETT>Espo, if the guy is hell-bent on leaving the nest,

683
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,830
<22-7,BECKETT>那我没什么可做的了
<22-7,BECKETT>then there is nothing that I can do about it.

684
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,940
<22-8,ESPOSITO>你不是真这么想吧
<22-8,ESPOSITO>You don't really feel that way, do you?

685
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,860
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>别听那些人唧唧歪歪  夏洛克
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>Don't you listen to those whiners, Sherlock.

686
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,200
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>你有种的
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>You got balls.

687
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,660
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>是  或许我刚刚没必要
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, I may have needlessly put you

688
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,240
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>让你在威勒斯那儿犯险
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>in a little harm's way there with Vales,

689
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,470
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>但是还是有成效的
<23-1,SLAUGHTER>but seeing as it paid off...

690
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,350
<23-2,CASTLE>有成效是什么意思
<23-2,CASTLE>What do you mean, paid off?

691
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,920
<23-3,CASTLE>-那是什么  -你说什么呢
<23-3,CASTLE>- What was that? - What was what?

692
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,340
<23-5,GILBERTO MENDOZA>伙计  这么做不好吧
<23-5,GILBERTO MENDOZA>Hey, come on, man! It's not cool!

693
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,480
<23-6,CASTLE>后备箱里有人吗
<23-6,CASTLE>Is there someone in the trunk?

694
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,790
<23-7,SLAUGHTER>吉尔伯托·门多萨  我们要找的软肋
<23-7,SLAUGHTER>Gilberto Mendoza, our weak link.

695
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,570
<23-8,GILBERTO>快点放我出去  伙计
<23-8,GILBERTO>Get me the hell outta here, man!

696
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,580
<23-9,CASTLE>告诉我我们只是和他谈谈
<23-9,CASTLE>Please tell me that we are just going to talk to him.

697
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,780
<23-10,SLAUGHTER>差不多吧
<23-10,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, pretty much.

698
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,480
<24-1,GILBERTO>伙计  怎么回事  你不能这么做
<24-1,GILBERTO>Come on, man! What's going on?! You can't do that!

699
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,220
<24-2,CASTLE>这么做不对  快停下
<24-2,CASTLE>This is wrong. You gotta stop.

700
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,100
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>除非他告发威勒斯
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>Not till he flips on Vales.

701
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,020
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>你听见了吗  吉尔伯托
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>You hear that, Gilberto?

702
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,630
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>你想从后备箱出来  唯一的方法
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>Only way you're gettin' out of that trunk

703
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,250
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>就是供出你的老板
<24-3,SLAUGHTER>is if you rat out your boss.

704
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,520
<24-4,GILBERTO>告诉你吧  我是什么都不会说的
<24-4,GILBERTO>Well, guess what. I'm not sayin' nothing!

705
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,450
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>还记得你说我欠我人情的事吗
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>Hey, remember that favor you promised me?

706
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,490
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>有个民众审查委员会找我麻烦
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>There's this civilian review board thing coming up.

707
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,900
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>过度用武投诉  全都是废话  对吧
<24-5,SLAUGHTER>Excessive force complaints. Total B.S., right?

708
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,020
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>总之  你不是跟市长是朋友什么的
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>Anyway, you being a friend of the mayor and all,

709
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,550
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>我想你去说句话
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>I figure a statement from you

710
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,450
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>一定会让那些指控都撤销的  是吧
<24-6,SLAUGHTER>would go a long way to making those charges go away, right?

711
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
<24-7,CASTLE>你疯了
<24-7,CASTLE>You're crazy.

712
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,100
<24-8,SLAUGHTER>是"不"的意思吗
<24-8,SLAUGHTER>Is that a no?

713
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,940

<24-9,CASTLE>I'll do it! I'll do it if you stop!

<24-10,SLAUGHTER>I'll send you an e-mail.

717
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,160
<25-1,GILBERTO>伙计  我知道我的权利
<25-1,GILBERTO>Hey, man, I know my rights, all right?

718
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,510
<25-1,GILBERTO>这是绑架  滥用执法权
<25-1,GILBERTO>This is kidnapping. Police abuse.

719
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,170
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>我也知道一些事  吉尔伯托
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>I know something, too, Gilberto.

720
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,210
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>你在德克萨斯州少管所里有个弟弟
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>You got a brother in juvie back in Texas.

721
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,500
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>可怜的海克特
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>Poor little Hector.

722
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,830
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>我听说他每天晚上都以泪洗面
<25-2,SLAUGHTER>I hear he cries himself to sleep every night.

723
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,000
<25-3,CASTLE>你到底在做什么
<25-3,CASTLE>Hey, what the hell are you doing?

724
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,710
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>就是和吉尔伯托聊会儿天
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>Just having a little chat here with Gilberto.

725
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,370
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>听着  除非你想让海克特有什么不测
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>Listen, unless you want something very bad to happen to Hector,

726
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,150
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>你得帮我扳倒威勒斯  行吧
<25-4,SLAUGHTER>you're gonna help me bury Vales, aren't ya?

727
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,220
<25-5,GILBERTO>听见了吗
<25-5,GILBERTO>Aren't ya?

728
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,120
<25-5,GILBERTO>-好  -好什么
<25-5,GILBERTO>- Okay. - Okay, what?

729
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,160
<25-6,SLAUGHTER>我需要听你说咒语
<25-6,SLAUGHTER>I need to hear the magic words.

730
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,060
<25-7,GILBERTO>威勒斯杀了格林奇
<25-7,GILBERTO>Vales killed Glitch.

731
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,010
<25-7,GILBERTO>威勒斯杀了格林奇
<25-7,GILBERTO>Vales killed Glitch.

732
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,850
<25-8,SLAUGHTER>胜利
<25-8,SLAUGHTER>Yes. Victory.

733
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,320
<26-1,GILBERTO>威勒斯当时在想办法抢过牙买加人
<26-1,GILBERTO>Vales was looking for a way to take over the Jamaicans'

734
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,800
<26-1,GILBERTO>和西部帮派的地盘
<26-1,GILBERTO>and the Westies' turf.

735
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,680
<26-1,GILBERTO>刚好我们听说有个西部帮派废物
<26-1,GILBERTO>That's when we heard about this punk-ass westie

736
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,950
<26-1,GILBERTO>想要证明自己  威勒斯看到了机会
<26-1,GILBERTO>trying to prove himself, and Vales saw his chance.

737
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,280
<26-1,GILBERTO>他说服格林奇
<26-1,GILBERTO>He convinced Glitch that

738
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,740
<26-1,GILBERTO>如果他挖出几个牙买加人并砍掉他们头
<26-1,GILBERTO>if he dug up a couple of Jamaicans and cut off their heads,

739
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,990
<26-1,GILBERTO>就能让他回到他西部帮派的伙伴当中
<26-1,GILBERTO>that it would get him back in tight with his westie pals.

740
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,970
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>威勒斯想用几个人头来引发一场帮派斗争
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>So Vales wanted to use the heads to spark a gang war?

741
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,650
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>让西部帮派和牙买加人都投入其中
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>For the Westies and Jamaicans to go at it

742
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,550
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>直到人都死光了
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>till no one's left standing,

743
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,410
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>他可以轻松过来占领地盘
<26-2,SLAUGHTER>then he waltzes in, takes over the territory?

744
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,490
<26-3,GILBERTO>是的
<26-3,GILBERTO>Yeah.

745
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,310
<26-4,SLAUGHTER>在墓地发生了什么
<26-4,SLAUGHTER>What went down at the cemetery?

746
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,580
<26-5,GILBERTO>威勒斯让格林奇去挖尸体
<26-5,GILBERTO>Vales got Glitch to dig up the bodies.

747
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,750
<26-5,GILBERTO>计划是杀了他
<26-5,GILBERTO>The plan was to kill him

748
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,730
<26-5,GILBERTO>伪装成牙买加人干的样子
<26-5,GILBERTO>and make it look like the Jamaicans did it.

749
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,250
<26-5,GILBERTO>格林奇一定是察觉到了什么
<26-5,GILBERTO>And Glitch must have sensed it or something,

750
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,470
<26-5,GILBERTO>我们一开火他就跑掉了
<26-5,GILBERTO>'cause he took off right as we started opening fire.

751
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,790
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>讲讲谋杀的事
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>Tell me about the murder.

752
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,130
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>孩子  我知道你有点害怕
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>Look, kid, I know you're scared,

753
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,500
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>我也有点粗暴
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>and I was a little rough.

754
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,970
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>但是我与检察官和联调局的人谈过了
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>But I talked to the D.A. and the feds.

755
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,300
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>他们说只要你配合我的调查
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>They said, you cooperate with me,

756
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,800
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>你弟弟将减到有期徒刑
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>your brother's sentence will be reduced to time served,

757
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,470
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>你们兄弟俩都将作为联邦证人受到保护
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>and both of you get a free ride into witsec.

758
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,830
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>赶紧告诉我怎么回事
<26-6,SLAUGHTER>So tell me how it went down.

759
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,650
<26-7,GILBERTO>我们追他  堵住了他
<26-7,GILBERTO>We chased him, we cornered him.

760
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,270
<26-8,SLAUGHTER>在天桥下面吗
<26-8,SLAUGHTER>Under the overpass?

761
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,790
<26-9,GILBERTO>是的
<26-9,GILBERTO>Yeah.

762
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,720
<26-10,SLAUGHTER>然后呢
<26-10,SLAUGHTER>And?

763
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,310
<26-11,GILBERTO>然后威勒斯两枪将他毙命
<26-11,GILBERTO>And then Vales shot him twice and just left him for dead.

764
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,730
<26-12,SLAUGHTER>到底多少枪
<26-12,SLAUGHTER>How many--how many times?

765
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,450
<26-13,GILBERTO>三枪
<26-13,GILBERTO>Three.

766
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,500
<26-13,GILBERTO>他开了三枪
<26-13,GILBERTO>He shot him three times.

767
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,540
<27-1,CASTLE>你认为你在干什么
<27-1,CASTLE>What do you think you're doing?

768
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,950
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>结案啊
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>Closing this case.

769
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,470
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>我拿到了威勒斯的逮捕令
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>I got an arrest warrant for Vales

770
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,570
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>就放在我口袋里等着派上用场呢
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>burning a hole in my pocket.

771
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,090
<27-3,CASTLE>你在受审时指示那孩子按你的意图说
<27-3,CASTLE>You coached that kid through his interrogation.

772
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,100
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>哪有
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>What? Nah, nah.

773
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>我只是帮助他回忆而已
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>I just refreshed his recollection.

774
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,530
<27-5,CASTLE>真的吗  因为根据他的语气
<27-5,CASTLE>Really? 'cause the way he was talking,

775
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,930
<27-5,CASTLE>他甚至没有目击这起谋杀
<27-5,CASTLE>he didn't even witness that murder.

776
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,100
<27-5,CASTLE>嘿
<27-5,CASTLE>Hey. H--

777
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,870
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>威勒斯身上的命案多到你不敢想象
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>Vales has bodies on him like you wouldn't believe--

778
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,720
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>女人  小孩  警察都有
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>Women, children, cops.

779
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,550
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>有机会逮住他  我绝不会浪费
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>And I got a chance to put him away. I'm gonna take it.

780
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,100
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>问题在于  你加入还是退出
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>The question is, are you in or out?

781
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,930
<27-7,CASTLE>我想我还是退出吧
<27-7,CASTLE>I guess I'm out.

782
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,050
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>真可惜
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>Well, that's a shame.

783
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,070
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>我对你寄予厚望呢  夏洛克
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>I had high hopes for you, Sherlock.

784
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,400
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>没想到你如此胆小怕事
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>Never thought you'd punk out on me like this.

785
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,630
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>嘿
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>Hey.

786
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,540
<27-9,CASTLE>我需要帮助
<27-9,CASTLE>I need some help.

787
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,470
<27-10,RYAN>抱歉  卡塞尔  有案子在身
<27-10,RYAN>Sorry, Castle. Caught a murder.

788
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,880
<27-11,ESPOSITO>跟贝克特说去
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Talk to Beckett.

789
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,610
<27-11,ESPOSITO>嘿
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Hey.

790
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,290
<27-12,CASTLE>你最近怎样
<27-12,CASTLE>How's it going?

791
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,930
<27-13,BECKETT>别拐弯抹角  卡塞尔  你想要什么
<27-13,BECKETT>You can skip the small talk, Castle. What do you want?

792
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,540
<27-14,CASTLE>斯勒特做得过头了
<27-14,CASTLE>Slaughter went too far.

793
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,240
<27-15,BECKETT>那是他的作风啊
<27-15,BECKETT>Well, isn't that what he does,

794
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,680
<27-15,BECKETT>绝赞威武  风光无两
<27-15,BECKETT>Along with kicking ass and taking names?

795
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,990
<27-16,CASTLE>他为了能抓捕威勒斯
<27-16,CASTLE>He pressured a kid into making a false statement

796
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,380
<27-16,CASTLE>威逼证人做假口供
<27-16,CASTLE>so he could arrest Vales.

797
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,550
<27-17,BECKETT>于是你找我去弥补
<27-17,BECKETT>So you came to me so I can fix it?

798
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,670
<27-18,CASTLE>你完全有理由生气
<27-18,CASTLE>You have every right to be mad.

799
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,570
<27-18,CASTLE>你向我警告过斯勒特的为人  我却当耳旁风
<27-18,CASTLE>You warned me about Slaughter, and I wouldn't listen.

800
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,640
<27-18,CASTLE>我只是想弥补这一切
<27-18,CASTLE>I'm just trying to make this right.

801
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,520
<27-19,BECKETT>这不是我的案子  卡塞尔
<27-19,BECKETT>It's not my case, Castle.

802
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,090
<27-19,BECKETT>即使我想帮忙
<27-19,BECKETT>Even if I wanted to help,

803
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,420
<27-19,BECKETT>我们也有一套严格的规定
<27-19,BECKETT>we've got strict rules about

804
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,340
<27-19,BECKETT>限制我们干涉其他警察的案子
<27-19,BECKETT>interfering in another cop's investigation.

805
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,290
<27-20,CASTLE>我不是要你帮我的忙
<27-20,CASTLE>I'm not asking you to do it for me.

806
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,250
<27-20,CASTLE>我是求你为了
<27-20,CASTLE>I'm asking you to do it

807
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,630
<27-20,CASTLE>不使真凶逃脱惩罚而这样做
<27-20,CASTLE>so the real killer doesn't get away with murder.

808
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,860
<27-21,BECKETT>你这么明目张胆的操纵我
<27-21,BECKETT>What makes you think I'm actually gonna fall

809
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,560
<27-21,BECKETT>我凭什么上钩
<27-21,BECKETT>for that blatant manipulation?

810
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,780
<27-22,CASTLE>因为我说的是实话
<27-22,CASTLE>Because it's true.

811
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,320
<27-23,CASTLE>这是什么
<27-23,CASTLE>What's this?

812
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,470
<27-24,BECKETT>监控录像拍摄显示威勒斯的车子
<27-24,BECKETT>A traffic cam shot of Vales' car

813
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,830
<27-24,BECKETT>离公墓有十个街区  朝格林奇被杀所处天桥
<27-24,BECKETT>10 blocks from the cemetery, heading away from the overpass

814
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,360
<27-24,BECKETT>反方向行驶
<27-24,BECKETT>where Glitch was killed.

815
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,240
<27-25,CASTLE>11点57
<27-25,CASTLE>11:57.

816
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,180
<27-25,CASTLE>格林奇是午夜之后被害的
<27-25,CASTLE>Glitch was killed after midnight.

817
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,860
<27-25,CASTLE>这表明威勒斯不可能杀害他
<27-25,CASTLE>This shows that Vales couldn't have killed him.

818
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,830
<27-25,CASTLE>你这是为我做的吗
<27-25,CASTLE>You did this for me?

819
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,910
<27-26,CASTLE>你一直都在保护我
<27-26,CASTLE>All this time, you had my back.

820
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,700
<27-27,BECKETT>我让莱恩查了监控录像
<27-27,BECKETT>I had Ryan run a traffic cam search

821
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,380
<27-27,BECKETT>那时他正在帮某人调车牌
<27-27,BECKETT>while he was pulling a plate.

822
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,040
<27-27,BECKETT>这不是确凿证据  卡塞尔
<27-27,BECKETT>It's not a smoking gun, Castle.

823
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,830
<27-27,BECKETT>知道吗  你连威勒斯的脸都看不到
<27-27,BECKETT>Okay? You can't even see Vales' face in that photo.

824
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,750
<27-27,BECKETT>这还不足以使斯勒特改变想法
<27-27,BECKETT>It's not enough to change Slaughter's mind

825
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,630
<27-27,BECKETT>除非你还有别的证据
<27-27,BECKETT>unless you've got something else.

826
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,760
<27-28,CASTLE>还有一个说不通的疑点
<27-28,CASTLE>There is one more thing that doesn't make sense.

827
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,870
<27-28,CASTLE>这是那块区域的地图
<27-28,CASTLE>This is a map of the area.

828
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,950
<27-28,CASTLE>这里是公墓  这里是天桥
<27-28,CASTLE>Here's the cemetery. Here's the overpass.

829
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,530
<27-28,CASTLE>但是若要到达那里  格林奇得翻1.8米的围墙
<27-28,CASTLE>But to get to it, Glitch would have to climb a 6-foot fence.

830
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,820
<27-28,CASTLE>一街区之隔就有个地铁  他为何还要那样做呢
<27-28,CASTLE>Why do that when there's a subway station a block away?

831
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
<27-28,CASTLE>如果可以逃跑为啥还要躲藏呢
<27-28,CASTLE>Why hide when you can run?

832
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,470
<27-29,BECKETT>也许我们能解开谜底
<27-29,BECKETT>Maybe we can find out.

833
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,440
<28-1,CASTLE>根据鉴证组报告
<28-1,CASTLE>According to the C.S.U. report,

834
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,010
<28-1,CASTLE>格林奇是在这附近被射中的
<28-1,CASTLE>Glitch was shot somewhere around here. Uh-huh.

835
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,910
<28-3,CASTLE>他蹒跚着逃走
<28-3,CASTLE>He staggered away

836
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,720
<28-3,CASTLE>最终死在柱子的另一边
<28-3,CASTLE>and ended up on the other side of that pillar.

837
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,280
<28-4,BECKETT>那么你认为威勒斯的计划就是利用格林奇
<28-4,BECKETT>So you think that Vales' plan was to use Glitch

838
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,460
<28-4,BECKETT>和牙买加黑帮的头目来挑起黑帮火并
<28-4,BECKETT>and the jamaican heads to start up a gang war?

839
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,320
<28-5,CASTLE>是的  有什么不对吗
<28-5,CASTLE>Yeah. Why?

840
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,360
<28-6,BECKETT>我不知道  卡塞尔  跟我了解到的证据对不上
<28-6,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle. That's not what I'm seeing.

841
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,690
<28-6,BECKETT>假设我是威勒斯
<28-6,BECKETT>Let's say I'm Vales

842
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,340
<28-6,BECKETT>射杀了格林奇挑起火并
<28-6,BECKETT>and I shoot Glitch to start that war.

843
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,260
<28-6,BECKETT>你认为哪儿会是
<28-6,BECKETT>Where do you think would be

844
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,460
<28-6,BECKETT>最佳抛尸地点
<28-6,BECKETT>the best spot to drop off that body?

845
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,160
<28-7,CASTLE>西部帮派的地盘
<28-7,CASTLE>In the middle of westie territory.

846
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,180
<28-8,BECKETT>没错  那为何他会将尸体留在这儿
<28-8,BECKETT>Exactly. So why did he leave it here?

847
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,810
<28-9,CASTLE>糟糕
<28-9,CASTLE>Oh, crap.

848
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,160
<28-9,CASTLE>好吧
<28-9,CASTLE>Well...

849
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:48,870
<28-10,SLAUGHTER>想象一下当我带着凶手到分局  听说你们
<28-10,SLAUGHTER>Imagine my surprise when I got to the station with my killer,

850
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,380
<28-10,SLAUGHTER>在我的犯罪现场搅和的时候有多惊讶吧
<28-10,SLAUGHTER>and I hear you're stirring up my crime scene.

851
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,600
<28-11,CASTLE>听着  我可以解释
<28-11,CASTLE>Okay, look, I can explain.

852
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,990
<28-12,SLAUGHTER>省省吧  他不懂规矩  但你是知道的
<28-12,SLAUGHTER>Save it. He doesn't know any better, but you do.

853
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,850
<28-13,BECKETT>我知道的是你对一个18岁的少年
<28-13,BECKETT>What I know is that you coerced a confession

854
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,420
<28-13,BECKETT>刑讯逼供
<28-13,BECKETT>out of an 18-year-old kid.

855
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,190
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>我没有逼供杰克
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>I didn't coerce Jack.

856
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,240
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>他老大手里杀死的人的尸体
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>He works for a guy who's got a trail of bodies

857
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,090
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>多得连起来都能排到格兰德河了
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>that stretches all the way back to the rio grande.

858
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,510
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>如果这次不抓住他
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>If he doesn't go down for this,

859
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,720
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>他还会残害更多人
<28-14,SLAUGHTER>the body count just grows.

860
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,420
<28-15,CASTLE>我们有监控录像显示威勒斯的凯迪拉克
<28-15,CASTLE>We got a traffic video camera photo of Vales' escalade

861
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,020
<28-15,CASTLE>在案发时离现场有10街区呢
<28-15,CASTLE>10 blocks from here when the murder went down.

862
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,840
<28-16,SLAUGHTER>那有怎样  你能看见他在车里吗
<28-16,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, so what? Could you see him in the car?

863
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,360
<28-17,CASTLE>看不清
<28-17,CASTLE>Not exactly.

864
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,750
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>如果他的律师得到了这个证据
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>And if his lawyer gets ahold of it,

865
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,560
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>他们就可以提出合理质疑
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>you've handed him reasonable doubt,

866
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,250
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>威勒斯就会免于刑罚
<28-18,SLAUGHTER>And Vales walks.

867
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,350
<28-19,CASTLE>也许他本就不该受罚
<28-19,CASTLE>Maybe he deserves to walk.

868
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,600
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>他应该被五马分尸
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>He deserves to be pulled apart by horses.

869
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,370
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>但是法律不允许我这样做
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>But the law says I can't do that.

870
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,400
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>但是我能做的是
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>But what I can do is,

871
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,680
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>让他下辈子都在牢里度过
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>I can lock him up in prison for the rest of his life.

872
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,270
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>现在问题在于  你们要么别插手
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>Now the question is, are you gonna back off

873
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,190
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>要么我就举报你们干涉我的案子
<28-20,SLAUGHTER>or am I gonna have to report you for jumping my case?

874
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,720
<28-21,BECKETT>你做你该做的  斯勒特
<28-21,BECKETT>You do what you gotta do, Slaughter.

875
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,240
<28-21,BECKETT>我做我该做的
<28-21,BECKETT>And I'll do the same.

876
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,150
<28-23,CASTLE>多谢
<28-23,CASTLE>Thanks.

877
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,360
<28-24,BECKETT>在我被警监狠狠教训之前
<28-24,BECKETT>We got about an hour to figure out who really killed Glitch

878
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,480
<28-24,BECKETT>我们还有一个小时查清
<28-24,BECKETT>before I get called to the carpet

879
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,220
<28-24,BECKETT>杀死格林奇的真凶
<28-24,BECKETT>by the chief of detectives.

880
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,390
<28-25,CASTLE>他会怎么对你
<28-25,CASTLE>What can he do to you?

881
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,060
<28-26,BECKETT>最好的情况是
<28-26,BECKETT>Well, best-case scenario,

882
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,390
<28-26,BECKETT>停职
<28-26,BECKETT>he suspends me.

883
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,440
<28-27,CASTLE>最坏的情况呢
<28-27,CASTLE>And worst-case scenario?

884
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,130
<28-28,CASTLE>糟了
<28-28,CASTLE>Crap.

885
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,930
<28-28,CASTLE>我扮演格林奇
<28-28,CASTLE>So I'm Glitch.

886
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,540
<29-1,CASTLE>我挖出三具尸体  砍下了他们的头
<29-1,CASTLE>I just dug up three bodies, cut the heads off 'em,

887
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,690
<29-1,CASTLE>很恐怖
<29-1,CASTLE>which was horrible,

888
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,310
<29-1,CASTLE>试图以此跟西部帮派示好
<29-1,CASTLE>to try and win my way back in with the westies.

889
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,850
<29-1,CASTLE>然后那个我以为是在帮我的
<29-1,CASTLE>And then the kindly Mexican gentlemen

890
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:17,700
<29-1,CASTLE>"善良"的墨西哥绅士
<29-1,CASTLE>I thought were helping me

891
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,400
<29-1,CASTLE>突然拔出枪想要杀死我
<29-1,CASTLE>suddenly pull out guns and try to kill me.

892
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,910
<29-1,CASTLE>拼命逃跑
<29-1,CASTLE>Running for my life,

893
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,910
<29-1,CASTLE>一直跑到围栏这边
<29-1,CASTLE>I end up on the wrong side of this fence.

894
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,530
<29-2,BECKETT>这里你能看到地铁的标志
<29-2,BECKETT>Where you can see a sign for the subway.

895
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,870
<29-2,BECKETT>明明可以向右跳上列车离开
<29-2,BECKETT>So why would you climb a barbed wire fence

896
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,420
<29-2,BECKETT>为什么还要爬过这个带倒刺铁丝的围栏呢
<29-2,BECKETT>when can just hang a right and hop a train outta here?

897
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,630
<29-3,CASTLE>恐惧
<29-3,CASTLE>Fear.

898
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,880
<29-3,CASTLE>我只知道  墨西哥人
<29-3,CASTLE>For all I know, the Mexicans

899
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,670
<29-3,CASTLE>沿着街道开车找我
<29-3,CASTLE>are driving the streets looking for me.

900
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,770
<29-3,CASTLE>这些街道上灯火通明  我很容易暴露
<29-3,CASTLE>With all these street lights on, I'd be a sitting duck.

901
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,860
<29-3,CASTLE>而在这下面  一片漆黑
<29-3,CASTLE>But under here, it would be pitch black,

902
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,800
<29-3,CASTLE>所以我爬过围栏躲起来
<29-3,CASTLE>so I climb the fence and I hide.

903
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:47,900
<29-4,BECKETT>能逃脱为什么还要躲起来呢
<29-4,BECKETT>Why hide when you can escape?

904
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,130
<29-5,CASTLE>因为我不仅仅是躲着
<29-5,CASTLE>Because I wasn't just hiding.

905
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,450
<29-5,CASTLE>我在等待  因为叫了后援
<29-5,CASTLE>I was waiting. I called for help.

906
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,660
<29-5,CASTLE>但他们发现格林奇的尸体时
<29-5,CASTLE>But when they found Glitch's body,

907
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,000
<29-5,CASTLE>并没有在他身上找到手机  所以
<29-5,CASTLE>he didn't have a phone on him, so--

908
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,370
<29-6,BECKETT>所以要么是凶手拿走了  要么...
<29-6,BECKETT>So either the killer took it or...

909
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,940
<29-7,CASTLE>要么就是他使用了付费电话
<29-7,CASTLE>Or he used that pay phone.

910
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,760
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>为什么叫我来这里
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>Why'd you call me down here?

911
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,240
<30-2,BECKETT>因为我们有充足的证据证明不是威勒斯杀了格林奇
<30-2,BECKETT>Because we have definitive proof that Vales didn't kill Glitch.

912
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,980
<30-3,SLAUGHTER>你想当面让我难堪吗
<30-3,SLAUGHTER>And you want to rub my face in it?

913
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
<30-4,CASTLE>不是
<30-4,CASTLE>No.

914
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,240
<30-5,BECKETT>斯勒特  听好  我们是不同的警察
<30-5,BECKETT>Look, Slaughter, we're different kinds of cops.

915
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,820
<30-6,SLAUGHTER>没错
<30-6,SLAUGHTER>Yeah.

916
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,290
<30-7,BECKETT>尽管我不赞同你的方法
<30-7,BECKETT>And although I'm not a fan of your methods,

917
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,160
<30-7,BECKETT>我知道  明知真凶还逍遥法外
<30-7,BECKETT>I know you don't want to send an innocent man to jail

918
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,910
<30-7,BECKETT>你是不会让其他人无辜入狱的
<30-7,BECKETT>when you know that the real killer is still out there.

919
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,570
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>好吧  那么是谁杀了格林奇
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>Okay. So who killed Glitch?

920
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,850
<31-1,BECKETT>我们知道他打给你了  布莱恩
<31-1,BECKETT>We know he called you, Brian.

921
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,930
<31-1,BECKETT>你儿子在被杀前半小时
<31-1,BECKETT>Your son dialed your cell from that pay phone

922
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,850
<31-1,BECKETT>用那个付费电话打了你的手机
<31-1,BECKETT>about a half an hour before he was murdered,

923
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,780
<31-1,BECKETT>而且你接了电话
<31-1,BECKETT>and you answered that call.

924
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,670
<31-1,BECKETT>我们还有凶案前后
<31-1,BECKETT>We also have surveillance photos

925
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,000
<31-1,BECKETT>你在地铁站的
<31-1,BECKETT>of you at that subway stop from before

926
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,550
<31-1,BECKETT>监控照片
<31-1,BECKETT>and after the murder.

927
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,120
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>这么些年
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>All those years...

928
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,510
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>这么些烂摊子
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>All those screwups--

929
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,520
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>对于像你这样有胆识的人来说一定很难忍受吧
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>Must have been unbearable for a stand-up guy like you,

930
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,730
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>布莱恩  是吗
<31-2,SLAUGHTER>Huh, Brian?

931
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,680
<31-3,BECKETT>格林奇打给你  告诉你他又一次
<31-3,BECKETT>And then Glitch calls you to tell you that he screwed up

932
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,930
<31-3,BECKETT>搞糟了
<31-3,BECKETT>again.

933
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,900
<31-3,BECKETT>但是这一次  很特别  对吗
<31-3,BECKETT>But this time, it was different, wasn't it?

934
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,360
<31-4,BRIAN>他逾矩了
<31-4,BRIAN>He'd crossed the line.

935
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
<31-5,BECKETT>他是你的儿子
<31-5,BECKETT>He was your son.

936
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,980
<31-6,BRIAN>所以我要对他负责
<31-6,BRIAN>Which made him my responsibility.

937
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,080
<31-6,BRIAN>所以我做了该做的
<31-6,BRIAN>So I did what had to be done.

938
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,730
<31-7,BRIAN>他一点都不吃惊
<31-7,BRIAN>He wasn't even surprised.

939
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,190
<31-7,BRIAN>就好像他等这一刻等了一辈子
<31-7,BRIAN>'twas if he'd been waiting for it his whole life.

940
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,040
<31-8,SLAUGHTER>那你为什么不带走他们的头
<31-8,SLAUGHTER>Then why didn't you take the heads?

941
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,670
<31-8,SLAUGHTER>那样的话  这一切都不会追查到你和西部帮派
<31-8,SLAUGHTER>That way, none of this would come back on you and the westies.

942
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,880
<31-9,BRIAN>我开枪之后他就消失在了黑暗里
<31-9,BRIAN>He vanished into the dark after I'd shot him.

943
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,370
<31-9,BRIAN>即使只有最后一口气
<31-9,BRIAN>Even with his last breath,

944
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,450
<31-9,BRIAN>那孩子也要毁了我
<31-9,BRIAN>that boy managed to screw me up.

945
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,270
<32-1,CASTLE>至少最终你给布莱恩定了罪
<32-1,CASTLE>Well, at least you'll finally get a conviction on Brian.

946
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,330
<32-1,CASTLE>这也多少算是有点安慰了
<32-1,CASTLE>That's gotta be some consolation.

947
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,630
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>但是威勒斯还没被抓到
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>But Vales still walks.

948
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,480
<32-3,BECKETT>抱歉
<32-3,BECKETT>Excuse me.

949
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,230
<32-3,BECKETT>律师
<32-3,BECKETT>Counselor.

950
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,640
<32-3,BECKETT>我能和你的委托人说两句吗
<32-3,BECKETT>Can I speak with your client for a second?

951
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,610
<32-4,VALES>她可能想要我的签名
<32-4,VALES>She probably wants my autograph.

952
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,970
<32-5,BECKETT>你自我感觉良好  我知道
<32-5,BECKETT>You feel cocky. I get it.

953
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,790
<32-5,BECKETT>你刚刚摆脱谋杀控诉
<32-5,BECKETT>You just dodged a murder rap.

954
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,570
<32-5,BECKETT>今晚大概要出去和你的弟兄们庆祝一下
<32-5,BECKETT>Probably gonna go out tonight and celebrate with your boys,

955
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,860
<32-5,BECKETT>你也应该狂欢痛饮一番
<32-5,BECKETT>and you should paint the town.

956
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,140
<32-5,BECKETT>但是明天早晨
<32-5,BECKETT>But then in the morning,

957
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:21,950
<32-5,BECKETT>我要你滚出这个城市
<32-5,BECKETT>I want you to get the hell out of my city.

958
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,990
<32-6,VALES>但是我喜欢这里
<32-6,VALES>But I like it here.

959
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,850
<32-7,BECKETT>你可能现在喜欢
<32-7,BECKETT>You might like it right now.

960
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,630
<32-7,BECKETT>但是明天开始  你就会见识到
<32-7,BECKETT>But starting tomorrow, you're gonna see

961
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,660
<32-7,BECKETT>纽约警局全部警力
<32-7,BECKETT>just how hard a city New York can be

962
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,640
<32-7,BECKETT>都要弄垮你的日子
<32-7,BECKETT>when the full force of the NYPD

963
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,490
<32-7,BECKETT>是多么艰辛
<32-7,BECKETT>comes crashing down on you.

964
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,020
<32-7,BECKETT>三万警察
<32-7,BECKETT>With 30,000 cops

965
