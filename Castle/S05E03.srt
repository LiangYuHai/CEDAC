<1-3,ALEXIS>Remember? I wanted to ride my bike without training wheels,

15
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,920
<1-3,ALEXIS>像大孩子一样  而且我做到了
<1-3,ALEXIS>Like the big kids, and I did.

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,230
<1-3,ALEXIS>所以你奖励了这枚金牌给我

<1-4,CASTLE>But your dorm room is only so big.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,940
<1-4,CASTLE>你得留些东西在家里
<1-4,CASTLE>You're gonna have to leave some of this stuff behind.

<1-7,CASTLE>My little girl is going to college.

24
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,030
<1-8,MARTHA>仿佛就在昨天
<1-8,MARTHA>Seems like just yesterday,

25
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,630
<1-8,MARTHA>你还每晚帮她检查床底
<1-8,MARTHA>you were checking under the bed every night,

26
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,150
<1-8,MARTHA>跟她保证世上根本没有妖怪
<1-8,MARTHA>promising her that monsters aren't real.

27
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,960
<1-9,CASTLE>我说谎了  的确有妖怪
<1-9,CASTLE>Well, I lied. Monsters are real.

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,150
<1-9,CASTLE>就是新生宿舍的那些男生
<1-9,CASTLE>They're the boys in her freshman dorm.

29
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,420
<1-10,MARTHA>说到这个
<1-10,MARTHA>Oh, speaking of which,

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,760
<1-10,MARTHA>在阿丽克西斯离开之前  你是不是应该
<1-10,MARTHA>before Alexis leaves, don't you think you should have the, uh,

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,970
<1-10,MARTHA>跟她聊聊
<1-10,MARTHA>talk with her?

32
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,460
<1-11,CASTLE>你是指性教育吗  老妈  几年前就聊过了
<1-11,CASTLE>You mean the sex talk? Mother, I covered that ages ago.

33
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,430
<1-11,CASTLE>我获益匪浅
<1-11,CASTLE>I learned so much.

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,050
<1-12,MARTHA>我是说你和贝克特上床的事
<1-12,MARTHA>I mean the you-and-Beckett sex talk.

35
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,160
<1-13,CASTLE>妈  贝克特和我...
<1-13,CASTLE>Mother, Beckett and I ar--

<1-14,MARTHA>Save it, Richard.

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,510
<1-14,MARTHA>我知道那天早上我进来时
<1-14,MARTHA>I knew the morning I walked in here

38
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,790
<1-14,MARTHA>那可怜的丫头藏在...
<1-14,MARTHA>and the poor girl was hiding in the--

39
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,560
<1-16,CASTLE>你怎么知道的
<1-16,CASTLE>How did you know that?

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
<1-17,MARTHA>当妈都对这种事洞若观火好吧
<1-17,MARTHA>Mothers know these things.

41
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,120
<1-17,MARTHA>但我不希望哪天阿丽克西斯回到家
<1-17,MARTHA>But I don't think you want Alexis to walk in unannounced

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,010
<1-17,MARTHA>发现你和贝克特  出柜了
<1-17,MARTHA>and find you and Beckett... out of the closet.

43
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,120
<1-17,MARTHA>我说的"出柜"...
<1-17,MARTHA>And by "Out of the closet"--

44
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,810
<1-18,CASTLE>我知道你说的"出柜"是什么意思
<1-18,CASTLE>I--no, I-I-I know what you mean by "Out of the closet."

45
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,760
<1-19,MARTHA>好吧  所以..
<1-19,MARTHA>Okay, so...

46
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,460
<1-19,MARTHA>你不觉得应该告诉她吗
<1-19,MARTHA>Don't you think you should tell her?

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,660
<1-20,ALEXIS>告诉我什么
<1-20,ALEXIS>Tell me what?

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,410
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>你告诉了阿丽克西斯
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>You told Alexis?

49
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,890
<2-2,CASTLE>我也不想  我妈用她的绝地武士意念指使我的
<2-2,CASTLE>I didn't want to. Mother used her jedi mind tricks on me.

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,150
<2-3,BECKETT>她也知道了吗
<2-3,BECKETT>She knows, too?

51
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,390
<2-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她们知道这事的利害关系吗
<2-3,BECKETT>Castle, do they realize what's at stake here?

52
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,000
<2-3,BECKETT>如果阿丽克西斯告诉了蕾妮
<2-3,BECKETT>Because if Alexis tells Lanie...

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,220
<2-4,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯不会告诉蕾妮的
<2-4,CASTLE>Alexis won't tell Lanie.

54
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,530
<2-5,BECKETT>蕾妮会告诉埃斯波西托
<2-5,BECKETT>Lanie's gonna tell Esposito,

55
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,830
<2-5,BECKETT>埃斯波西托是肯定会告诉莱恩的
<2-5,BECKETT>Esposito can't keep his mouth shut with Ryan,

56
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,680
<2-5,BECKETT>而莱恩这个大嘴巴则会到处说
<2-5,BECKETT>And Ryan's gonna blow it out of proportion,

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,830
<2-5,BECKETT>那么盖茨就会知道了
<2-5,BECKETT>and then Gates is gonna find out,

58
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,180
<2-5,BECKETT>我们就不能再在一起工作了
<2-5,BECKETT>and we won't be able to work together anymore.

59
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,020
<2-5,BECKETT>相信我
<2-5,BECKETT>Trust me.

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,400
<2-6,CASTLE>她知道其中的利害关系
<2-6,CASTLE>She knows what's at stake,

61
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,690
<2-6,CASTLE>我们的秘密很安全
<2-6,CASTLE>and our secret is safe.

62
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,180
<2-7,BECKETT>她接受了吗
<2-7,BECKETT>So how did she take it,

63
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
<2-7,BECKETT>我们在一起的事
<2-7,BECKETT>us being together?

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,460
<2-8,CASTLE>她太专注于离家上学的事  连回应都没有
<2-8,CASTLE>She was too preoccupied with her move to even comment.

65
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,370
<2-8,CASTLE>真是太好笑了
<2-8,CASTLE>I mean, it's ridiculous.

66
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,190
<2-8,CASTLE>她打包了一箱又一箱的东西
<2-8,CASTLE>She's got boxes and boxes of stuff,

67
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,680
<2-8,CASTLE>很显然  样样东西都很重要
<2-8,CASTLE>And apparently, all of it's important.

68
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
<2-9,BECKETT>我们都需要自己的东西  卡塞尔
<2-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we all need our stuff, castle.

69
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,860
<2-9,BECKETT>我也有一箱又一箱的东西
<2-9,BECKETT>I've got boxes and boxes of it.

70
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,950
<2-9,BECKETT>有安慰的作用
<2-9,BECKETT>It's comforting.

71
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,530
<2-9,BECKETT>让我想起我的过去
<2-9,BECKETT>It reminds me of my past.

72
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,740
<2-10,CASTLE>你的叛逆过去吗
<2-10,CASTLE>Your kinky past?

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,410
<2-11,BECKETT>这个内容的也有一箱
<2-11,BECKETT>I've got that box, too.

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,730
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>清洁人员今早发现了她
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>Housekeeping found her this morning.

75
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,280
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>死者叫温蒂·杜普利  25岁
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>Name's Wendy Dupree, 25 years of age,

76
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,960
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>胸部中枪
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>single gunshot to the chest

77
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,960
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>凶器为9毫米手枪
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>from a 9 millimeter.

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,020
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>不幸的是  她没有立即毙命
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>Unfortunately, she died slowly.

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,120
<3-2,BECKETT>是啊  至少有时间写下"谎言"
<3-2,BECKETT>Yeah, long enough to write the word "Lie."

80
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,020
<3-2,BECKETT>看来凶手不是专业人士
<3-2,BECKETT>So our killer wasn't a pro.

81
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,740
<3-2,BECKETT>否则不会在她死之前离开
<3-2,BECKETT>She wouldn't have been left breathing.

82
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,430
<3-3,CASTLE>临终遗言  可这词是什么意思呢
<3-3,CASTLE>A dying declaration, but what does it mean?

83
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,010
<3-4,LANIE>这事儿归你们管
<3-4,LANIE>Hey, that's your department.

84
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,350
<3-5,CASTLE>有人对她说谎了吗
<3-5,CASTLE>Well, did someone lie to her?

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,850
<3-5,CASTLE>也有可能是凶手名字的首字母
<3-5,CASTLE>Perhaps it's the killer's initials.

86
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,820
<3-5,CASTLE>也许是语法错误
<3-5,CASTLE>Maybe a grammatical error.

87
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,520
<3-5,CASTLE>她本来想写的是过去时
<3-5,CASTLE>She should've written "Lay."

88
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,090
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>贝克特
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She came a long way to get killed.

91
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,470
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她是费城人
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She's a Philly girl.

92
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,370
<3-7,BECKETT>她到纽约多久了
<3-7,BECKETT>How long was she here for?

93
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,790
<3-8,ESPOSITO>前台说她是昨天下午一个人入住的
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Front desk says she checked in yesterday afternoon alone.

94
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,130
<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>她不是一个人
<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>She wasn't alone.

<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>她带了4千块"好朋友"
<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>She brought 4,000 of her closest friends.

96
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,360
<3-10,ESPOSITO>有这么多现金  怎么住这种破地方
<3-10,ESPOSITO>That kind of cash, what's she doing in a dump like this?

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,840
<3-11,BECKETT>好了  查查财务状况  看能发现什么
<3-11,BECKETT>All right, run financials. See what you guys can find.

98
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,460
<3-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你怎么想
<3-11,BECKETT>Castle, what do you think?

99
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,880
<3-12,CASTLE>我想  虽然我非常喜欢悬疑
<3-12,CASTLE>I think, as much as I love a good mystery,

100
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,130
<3-12,CASTLE>但她要是多留点有用的信息就好了
<3-12,CASTLE>she could've left a more helpful note.

101
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,290
<3-13,ESPOSITO>这条短信不用解释什么了
<3-13,ESPOSITO>Here's a message that needs no interpretation.

102
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,890
<3-13,ESPOSITO>"你以为可以骗我吗"
<3-13,ESPOSITO>"You think you can lie to me?"

103
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,130
<3-14,CASTLE>也许"谎言"就是指的这个
<3-14,CASTLE>Maybe that's the lie.

104
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,200
<3-15,ESPOSITO>"随你怎么逃  我一定会找到你让你付出代价"
<3-15,ESPOSITO>"Run all you want. I'm gonna find you and make you pay."

<4-2,BECKETT>Well, it sounds like you had a big problem with her.

<4-3,PRATT>那是当然了  问题大着呢

<4-4,CASTLE>"The best in Philly"? That's a tad presumptuous.

114
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,030
<4-4,CASTLE>本来就是
<4-4,CASTLE>Well, it is.

<4-5,PRATT>昨天我派这个骗子去银行
<4-5,PRATT>So yesterday I sent that fraud to the bank

116
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,420
<4-5,PRATT>把餐馆的收入存起来
<4-5,PRATT>to make a deposit for the restaurant, right?

117
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,270
<4-5,PRATT>可她存了吗  没有
<4-5,PRATT>But does she make the drop? No.

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,280
<4-5,PRATT>她带着我的4千美金逃到了这里
<4-5,PRATT>She hightails it up here with 4,000 of my dollars.

119
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,400
<4-6,CASTLE>那得卖好多三明治才能赚到
<4-6,CASTLE>That's a lot of cheesesteak.

120
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,050
<4-7,BECKETT>所以你追踪她到纽约  想取回你的钱
<4-7,BECKETT>So you followed her to New York to get your money back.

121
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,940
<4-8,PRATT>那是当然  我想和气地解决这事
<4-8,PRATT>Damn right. I tried to be nice.

122
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,020
<4-8,PRATT>终于  她给我打电话了
<4-8,PRATT>Finally, she calls me,

123
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
<4-8,PRATT>她说  抱歉  我有急用
<4-8,PRATT>And she's like, "I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

124
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,780
<4-8,PRATT>等我回来一定双倍偿还
<4-8,PRATT>I'll pay you back double when I get back."

125
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,160
<4-8,PRATT>去她妈的  她竟然偷我的钱
<4-8,PRATT>Screw that. She stole from me.

126
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,040
<4-9,BECKETT>就因为那样  她就该死吗
<4-9,BECKETT>And for that, she deserved to die?

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,940
<4-10,PRATT>是啊
<4-10,PRATT>Yeah.

128
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,350
<4-11,PRATT>等等  什么
<4-11,PRATT>Wait. What?

129
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,580
<4-11,PRATT>不
<4-11,PRATT>Oh, no.

130
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,040
<4-12,PRATT>不
<4-12,PRATT>No.

131
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,720
<4-12,PRATT>不是我干的
<4-12,PRATT>I didn't do this.

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,510
<4-12,PRATT>不  我都没找到她
<4-12,PRATT>Nah. I couldn't even find her.

133
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,610
<4-12,PRATT>不  我刚从费城开来的火车上下来
<4-12,PRATT>No, I-I just got off the train from Philly, uh,

134
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,590
<4-12,PRATT>差不多1小时后就被你们找过来了
<4-12,PRATT>an hour before yous guys picked me up.

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,150
<5-1,BECKETT>火车公司证实普拉特昨天的确买了票
<5-1,BECKETT>So amtrak confirms that Pratt was ticketed yesterday,

136
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,650
<5-1,BECKETT>但他们不确定他乘坐的是哪一趟车
<5-1,BECKETT>but they can't be sure of what train he was on.

137
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,170
<5-1,BECKETT>所以我们在复查他的不在场证明
<5-1,BECKETT>So we're double-checking his alibi.

138
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,080
<5-2,CASTLE>让他们顺便查查那家的三明治
<5-2,CASTLE>Have them check on that cheesesteak, too.

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,970
<5-2,CASTLE>那不可能是费城最棒的
<5-2,CASTLE>There's no way that it's the best in philly.

140
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,540
<5-3,BECKETT>总之  就算是他
<5-3,BECKETT>Anyway, even if it was him,

141
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
<5-3,BECKETT>也无法解释温蒂的神秘急事
<5-3,BECKETT>it doesn't explain Wendy's mysterious emergency--

142
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,480
<5-3,BECKETT>她偷钱
<5-3,BECKETT>The stolen cash,

143
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,540
<5-3,BECKETT>又突然来到纽约
<5-3,BECKETT>the sudden trip to New York city.

144
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,350
<5-4,CASTLE>她为什么要写"谎言"
<5-4,CASTLE>Why she would write "Lie."

145
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,860
<5-4,CASTLE>没人会在临死前用血随便写点东西开玩笑
<5-4,CASTLE>You don't write a dying message in blood just for kicks.

146
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,290
<5-4,CASTLE>肯定是有什么隐情的
<5-4,CASTLE>There had to be a reason.

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,840
<5-5,CASTLE>你也喝完了吗  要再来一点吗
<5-5,CASTLE>Are you out, too? Want some more?

148
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,470
<5-6,BECKETT>是啊  这次还是我去倒吧
<5-6,BECKETT>Yeah. Uh, you know what? I'll go get it.

149
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,400
<5-7,CASTLE>谢谢
<5-7,CASTLE>Thank you.

<5-8,CASTLE>Love is everything.

153
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,280
<5-8,CASTLE>噢  我刚说了这句吗
<5-8,CASTLE>Oh, did I just say that?

154
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,460
<5-8,CASTLE>我真是变得柔情似水啊
<5-8,CASTLE>I'm getting soft.

155
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,590

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,830
<5-10,LANIE>你不能接贝克特的电话的
<5-10,LANIE>You're not allowed to answer Beckett's phone.

158
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,240
<5-11,CASTLE>我可以的
<5-11,CASTLE>Yes, I am.

159

<5-12,LANIE>Since when?

160
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,780
<5-13,CASTLE>从我...
<5-13,CASTLE>Since I...

161
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,210
<5-13,CASTLE>请问你打来是有什么事吗
<5-13,CASTLE>Can--is there something I can do for you?

162

<5-14,LANIE>在系统中查不到对应的
<5-14,LANIE>No matches in the system

165
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,180
<5-14,LANIE>和普拉特先生的也不符
<5-14,LANIE>or to Mr. Pratt,

166
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,510
<5-14,LANIE>但我确实发现了一些DNA残留
<5-14,LANIE>But I did find some trace D.N.A.

167
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,290

<5-14,LANIE>Are you writing this down?

<5-20,CASTLE>I'm not in trouble.

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,900
<5-21,CASTLE>蕾妮发现了部分指纹
<5-21,CASTLE>Lanie got a partial print.

174
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,140
<5-21,CASTLE>跟普拉特的不符  他不是我们要找的凶手
<5-21,CASTLE>It is not a match for Pratt. He is not our guy.

175
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,220
<5-22,BECKETT>谁说你可以替我接电话啊
<5-22,BECKETT>Who said that you could answer my phone?

176
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,600
<5-22,BECKETT>你又为什么要翻我的抽屉
<5-22,BECKETT>And why are you going through my drawers?

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,750
<5-23,CASTLE>我只是在找张纸记东西罢了
<5-23,CASTLE>I was just looking for a pad of paper.

178
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,230
<5-24,BECKETT>说得好听  别碰我的东西  卡塞尔
<5-24,BECKETT>Sure you were. Stay out of my stuff, Castle.

179
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,120
<5-25,CASTLE>你的东西
<5-25,CASTLE>Your stuff?

<5-25,CASTLE>需要我提醒你一下吗
<5-25,CASTLE>Need I remind you,

<5-25,CASTLE>我已经见过你的"东西"了
<5-25,CASTLE>I've already seen your stuff.

182
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,170
<5-26,BECKETT>是啊  但我的有些东西还是隐私的
<5-26,BECKETT>Yeah, well, some of my stuff is still private.

183
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,900
<5-27,CASTLE>好吧  我懂了
<5-27,CASTLE>Oh, I get it.

184
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,820
<5-27,CASTLE>-肯定是老情人做了送给你的  -不是
<5-27,CASTLE>- An old boyfriend made that for you. - No.

185
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,550
<5-29,CASTLE>是吗  没关系啊  我不会吃醋的
<5-29,CASTLE>Really? 'cause it's totally cool. I wouldn't be jealous.

186
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,240
<5-29,CASTLE>好吧  或许会有点吃醋
<5-29,CASTLE>Okay, maybe a little bit jealous.

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,390
<5-29,CASTLE>-不是老情人吗  -不是
<5-29,CASTLE>- Not an old boyfriend? - Mnh-mnh.

188
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,570
<5-31,CASTLE>那你一定是从犯罪现场得到的
<5-31,CASTLE>You got it from a crime scene.

189
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,780
<5-31,CASTLE>那是个纪念品
<5-31,CASTLE>That is a keepsake

190
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,670
<5-31,CASTLE>纪念你破获的第一桩案件
<5-31,CASTLE>from the first murderer you ever collared.

191
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,340
<5-32,BECKETT>我告诉过你  卡塞尔
<5-32,BECKETT>I told you, Castle,

192
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,510
<5-32,BECKETT>那是个人隐私
<5-32,BECKETT>It's private.

193
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,910
<5-33,CASTLE>也可能是火柴人年会上
<5-33,CASTLE>Maybe it's the actual murder victim

194
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,650
<5-33,CASTLE>某个受害的火柴人
<5-33,CASTLE>from a stick man convention.

195
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,500
<5-33,CASTLE>不是吧你
<5-33,CASTLE>Really?

196
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,310
<5-34,BECKETT>你只能想出这种程度的烂故事了吗
<5-34,BECKETT>That's the best that you can come up with?

197
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,920
<5-35,CASTLE>-接受挑战  -那个...
<5-35,CASTLE>- Challenge accepted. - So...

198
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,730
<5-36,RYAN>从温蒂的财务账单上
<5-36,RYAN>Nothing in the financials

199
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,360
<5-36,RYAN>无法看出她为什么需要4千现金
<5-36,RYAN>explain why Wendy needed 4 grand in cash,

200
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
<5-36,RYAN>但我差不多知道她来这儿的目的了
<5-36,RYAN>But I might have figured out what she was doing in town.

201
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,620
<5-36,RYAN>她昨天刷了信用卡
<5-36,RYAN>She used her credit card

202
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,750
<5-36,RYAN>乘车去了第8大道和市场街
<5-36,RYAN>for a cab ride to 8th and market yesterday.

203
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,710
<5-37,CASTLE>就是她死的当天
<5-37,CASTLE>The day she was killed.

204
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,790
<5-38,RYAN>我跟一个出租车司机谈过  温蒂拿了他的名片
<5-38,RYAN>I spoke with a cabbie. Wendy took his business card.

205
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,740
<5-38,RYAN>说她会给他打电话
<5-38,RYAN>Said she was going to call

206
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,780
<5-38,RYAN>让他今天再送她过去
<5-38,RYAN>to have him take her back there today.

207
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,630
<5-39,CASTLE>我敢说那里会有我们想要的答案
<5-39,CASTLE>Bet we find our answer there.

208
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,980
<6-1,CASTLE>自储式仓库
<6-1,CASTLE>A self-storage warehouse?

209
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,840
<6-2,BECKETT>一个从费城来的姑娘到这儿来干什么
<6-2,BECKETT>What's a girl from Philly doing in a place like this?

210
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,570
<7-1,MANAGER>是的  是的
<7-1,MANAGER>Oh, yeah, yeah.

211
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,570
<7-1,MANAGER>她来过这里
<7-1,MANAGER>She was here.

212
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,920
<7-1,MANAGER>不过我见到她的时候身上可没这么多血
<7-1,MANAGER>A lot less bloody when I saw her, though.

213
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,540
<7-1,MANAGER>她报了名参加拍卖
<7-1,MANAGER>She signed up for the auction.

214
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,860
<7-2,BECKETT>拍卖
<7-2,BECKETT>Auction?

215
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,660
<7-3,MANAGER>我们每个月都会拍售被占用的储物仓库
<7-3,MANAGER>Every month we auction off repossessed storage units.

216
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,010
<7-3,MANAGER>就是那些赖账的
<7-3,MANAGER>You know, from deadbeats

217
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,840
<7-3,MANAGER>他们没有付账
<7-3,MANAGER>That don't pay their bills.

218
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,410
<7-3,MANAGER>现在就有场拍卖会正在进行呢
<7-3,MANAGER>There's one going on right now.

219
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,100
<7-4,CASTLE>那4千块就是为了这个
<7-4,CASTLE>That's what the $4,000 was for.

220
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,370
<7-4,CASTLE>她想拍下一间储物仓库
<7-4,CASTLE>She was gonna bid on a unit.

221
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,450
<7-5,BECKETT>哪一间呢
<7-5,BECKETT>Which unit?

222
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,770
<7-6,MANAGER>问倒我了
<7-6,MANAGER>Beats me.

223
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,610
<7-6,MANAGER>可能是我们打算拍售的14间中的任何一间
<7-6,MANAGER>Could be any one of the 14 we got up for bid.

224
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,680
<7-7,BECKETT>所以完全不知道她对哪间有兴趣
<7-7,BECKETT>So there's no way of telling which one she was interested in?

225
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,260
<7-8,CASTLE>其实  是有线索的
<7-8,CASTLE>Actually, there is a way.

226
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,650
<7-8,CASTLE>我们错误地理解了温蒂留下的信息
<7-8,CASTLE>We misinterpreted Wendy's message.

227
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,670
<7-8,CASTLE>那写的不是"谎言"
<7-8,CASTLE>It's not "Lie."

228
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,860
<7-8,CASTLE>我们把它看倒了
<7-8,CASTLE>We were looking at it upside down.

229
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,430
<7-8,CASTLE>应该是3-1-7  这才是她想说的
<7-8,CASTLE>It's "3-1-7." That's what she was trying to say.

230
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,020
<7-8,CASTLE>317号仓库在这次拍卖中吗
<7-8,CASTLE>Is unit 317 up for auction?

231
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,600
<7-9,MANAGER>哦  还真在
<7-9,MANAGER>Oh, as a matter of fact, it is.

232
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,700
<7-9,MANAGER>没准我们说话这会儿它已经拍卖出去了
<7-9,MANAGER>Probably auctioning it off as we speak.

233
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,890
<7-10,CASTLE>温蒂想买下这间仓库结果却被杀了
<7-10,CASTLE>Wendy was killed trying to buy that unit.

234
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,920
<7-10,CASTLE>如果我们让它白白被卖掉
<7-10,CASTLE>If we let it get sold off...

235
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,230
<7-11,BECKETT>那我们就失去找出凶手的好机会了
<7-11,BECKETT>Then we'll lose our best shot at finding out who the killer is.

245
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,980
<7-11,BECKETT>好  下一个  317号仓库
<7-11,BECKETT>Okay, next up is unit 317.

246
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,240
<8-1,AUCTIONEER>你们有一分钟的时间参观  然后开始竞拍
<8-1,AUCTIONEER>You have 60 seconds to look, and then we start the bidding.

247
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,670
<8-2,BECKETT>莱恩  这间仓库的所有者名叫约翰·弗莱明
<8-2,BECKETT>All right, Ryan, so the owner of the unit was a Johan Fleming.

248
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,880
<8-2,BECKETT>你能查一下吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Can you run that?

249
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,930
<8-2,BECKETT>好  谢了
<8-2,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

250
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,810
<8-2,BECKETT>我们需要你停止这次拍卖
<8-2,BECKETT>We need you to stop this auction.

251
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,710
<8-3,MANAGER>虽然我想帮忙  但是我更想赚钱
<8-3,MANAGER>As much as I'd like to help, I'd like my money more.

252
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,570
<8-3,MANAGER>所以你如果没有搜查令  我就不会阻止杰克
<8-3,MANAGER>So unless you got a warrant, I don't have to stop jack.

253
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,920
<8-4,AUCTIONEER>好  还有30秒
<8-4,AUCTIONEER>Okay, 30 seconds.

254
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,550
<8-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看见什么了
<8-5,BECKETT>Castle, what do you see?

255
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,210
<8-6,CASTLE>没看见什么
<8-6,CASTLE>Uh... not much.

256
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,070
<8-6,CASTLE>只是
<8-6,CASTLE>Just a...

257
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,890
<8-6,CASTLE>只是一堆垃圾
<8-6,CASTLE>Just a bunch of junk.

258
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,840
<8-7,BECKETT>可这堆垃圾里可能有温蒂案子的关键线索
<8-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, the key to Wendy's murder might be in that junk,

259
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,220
<8-7,BECKETT>而我们却要错过了
<8-7,BECKETT>And we're about to lose it.

260
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,430
<8-7,BECKETT>我来不及去搞搜查令了
<8-7,BECKETT>There's no way I can get a warrant in time.

261
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,730
<8-8,CASTLE>搞不到也没关系  我有更好的东西
<8-8,CASTLE>You may not have a warrant, but I got something better.

262
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,810
<8-8,CASTLE>支票本
<8-8,CASTLE>Checkbook.

420
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,350
<9-34,RYAN>看来约翰·弗莱明的真名叫温德尔·杜普利
<9-34,RYAN>Looks like Johan Fleming's actually Wendell Dupree.

421
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,840
<9-35,BECKETT>跟死者的姓是一样的

<9-36,CASTLE>Of course. It all makes sense now.

425
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,300

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,360
<9-37,CASTLE>超人双胞胎

<9-38,CASTLE>没搞错吧  伙计们
<9-38,CASTLE>Seriously, you guys,

432
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,830
<9-38,CASTLE>你们不看电视吗
<9-38,CASTLE>Do you not watch TV?

433
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,780
<9-39,ESPOSITO>如果这间仓库是她兄弟的

<9-39,ESPOSITO>那为什么温蒂还要去竞拍呢
<9-39,ESPOSITO>then why was Wendy bidding on it?

435
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580

<9-40,RYAN>Why did he stop making payments?

436
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,070
<9-40,RYAN>还有他为什么要用假名字呢
<9-40,RYAN>And why was he using an alias?

437
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,750
<9-41,BECKETT>我们还是先找到温德尔然后问他吧
<9-41,BECKETT>Why don't we track down Wendell and ask him?

438
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,730
<9-42,CASTLE>你们还是先买台电视吧
<9-42,CASTLE>Why don't you buy a TV?

439
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,140
<10-1,ESPOSITO>谁能想到盖茨警监还有温柔的一面
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Who knew that Gates had a softer side?

440
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,350
<10-1,ESPOSITO>天啊  太漂亮了
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, god. Just beautiful.

441
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,480
<10-2,RYAN>有点
<10-2,RYAN>It's, um...

442
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,220
<10-2,RYAN>瘆人  非常非常瘆人
<10-2,RYAN>Creepy, very, very... creepy.

443
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760
<10-3,ESPOSITO>她兄弟查的怎么样了
<10-3,ESPOSITO>So where are we on the brother?

444
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,690
<10-4,RYAN>他俩的生活很艰辛
<10-4,RYAN>Oh, it turns out the twins had a hard knock life.

445
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,100
<10-4,RYAN>父母在他们小的时候
<10-4,RYAN>Their parents died in a car crash

446
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,140
<10-4,RYAN>死于车祸
<10-4,RYAN>when they were teens.

447
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,610
<10-4,RYAN>温德尔似乎一直没能从伤痛中走出来
<10-4,RYAN>It's like Wendell never really fully recovered.

448
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,370
<10-4,RYAN>他不停地搬家  干些违法的事
<10-4,RYAN>He moved from town to town, getting in scrapes with the law.

449
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,710
<10-5,ESPOSITO>那我们去哪找他呢
<10-5,ESPOSITO>So where can we find him?

450
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,630
<10-6,RYAN>墓地里
<10-6,RYAN>In an urn.

451
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,350
<10-6,RYAN>他6周前死了
<10-6,RYAN>He died six weeks ago.

452
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,690
<10-6,RYAN>被地铁撞死了
<10-6,RYAN>Hit by a subway train.

453
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,490
<10-7,ESPOSITO>真惨
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Ouch.

454
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,610
<10-7,ESPOSITO>这就解释了他为什么不再付仓库租金了
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Explains why his storage bill wasn't paid.

455
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,820
<10-7,ESPOSITO>报告里说那是意外事故吗
<10-7,ESPOSITO>It says here it was an accident?

456
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,910
<10-8,RYAN>地铁里的监控器坏了
<10-8,RYAN>Well, the subway cameras were broken,

457
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,960
<10-8,RYAN>所以无法证实了
<10-8,RYAN>so there's really no way to know for sure.

458
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,760
<10-8,RYAN>如果他的死和温蒂的死有关
<10-8,RYAN>If his death is related to Wendy's,

459
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,670
<10-8,RYAN>这可能是又一起谋杀案
<10-8,RYAN>we could be looking at a second murder.

460
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
<11-1,BECKETT>刚刚联系了温蒂在费城的
<11-1,BECKETT>Okay, so that was one of Wendy's

461
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,010
<11-1,BECKETT>服务员同事
<11-1,BECKETT>fellow waitresses from Philly.

462
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,740
<11-1,BECKETT>据她所说  温蒂确信
<11-1,BECKETT>According to her, Wendy was convinced

463
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,180
<11-1,BECKETT>她弟弟并非死于意外
<11-1,BECKETT>that her brother's death wasn't an accident.

464
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,260
<11-1,BECKETT>显而易见  他陷入了某种危险中
<11-1,BECKETT>Apparently, he was involved in something dangerous.

465
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,330
<11-2,RYAN>哪种危险
<11-2,RYAN>What kind of dangerous?

466
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,970
<11-3,BECKETT>温蒂没说  不过据这位服务员所说
<11-3,BECKETT>Wendy didn't say, but according to this waitress,

467
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,310
<11-3,BECKETT>就在地铁意外前夕  温德尔打给他姐姐
<11-3,BECKETT>just before the subway accident, Wendell called his sister

468
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,790
<11-3,BECKETT>说事情已经结束
<11-3,BECKETT>and said it was over and

469
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,700
<11-3,BECKETT>所有的麻烦也已烟消云散
<11-3,BECKETT>all of their problems were solved.

470
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,230
<11-4,ESPOSITO>只不过  弟弟最终以死收场
<11-4,ESPOSITO>And yet, he ends up dead

471
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,470
<11-4,ESPOSITO>姐姐绝望到不惜冒一切风险
<11-4,ESPOSITO>and she was desperate enough to risk everything--

472
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,610
<11-4,ESPOSITO>丢工作  下监狱
<11-4,ESPOSITO>her job, jail--

473
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,320
<11-4,ESPOSITO>只为了找她弟弟的储物仓库
<11-4,ESPOSITO>just to go after her brother's storage unit.

474
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,260
<11-4,ESPOSITO>为什么呢
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Why?

475
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,560
<11-4,ESPOSITO>这些东西我们都查过了
<11-4,ESPOSITO>I mean, we've been through all this stuff,

476
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,650
<11-5,ESPOSITO>看起来就是堆不知所谓的废品
<11-5,ESPOSITO>it just seems like a bunch of random junk.

477
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,670
<11-5,ESPOSITO>也许只是
<11-5,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe it's just that

478
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,040
<11-6,BECKETT>我们还不清楚到底要找什么
<11-6,BECKETT>we don't know exactly what we're looking for.

479
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,880
<11-6,BECKETT>无论是谁杀了温蒂
<11-6,BECKETT>I mean, whoever killed Wendy

480
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,810
<11-6,BECKETT>极有可能是温德尔认识的人
<11-6,BECKETT>most likely came from Wendell's world.

481
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,010
<11-6,BECKETT>我们掌握了他的什么线索
<11-6,BECKETT>So what do we know about him?

482
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,540
<11-7,RYAN>过去的三个月里  温德尔一直用化名
<11-7,RYAN>For the last three months, using his wonder twin alias,

483
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,690
<11-7,RYAN>给一个叫安吉莉卡·亨利的人
<11-7,RYAN>Wendell worked as a chauffer

484
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,640
<11-7,RYAN>当司机
<11-7,RYAN>for one Angelica Henley,

485
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,890
<11-7,RYAN>她是个有权有势的贵妇
<11-7,RYAN>a wealthy socialite.

486
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,110
<11-7,RYAN>好
<11-7,RYAN>Okay.

487
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,710
<11-8,BECKETT>我们就从这查起
<11-8,BECKETT>Then let's start here.

488
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,920
<12-1,KIRBY SMITH>晚上好
<12-1,KIRBY SMITH>Good evening.

489
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,280
<12-1,KIRBY SMITH>能为你们效劳吗
<12-1,KIRBY SMITH>May I help you?

490
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,950
<12-2,BECKETT>我们想找亨利夫人谈谈
<12-2,BECKETT>Uh, we were hoping to speak with Ms. Henley.

491
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,630
<12-3,KIRBY>身穿紫色酒会礼服的女士就是了
<12-3,KIRBY>The lady in the purple cocktail dress.

492
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,710
<12-3,KIRBY>需要我引荐吗
<12-3,KIRBY>May I take you to her?

493
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,270
<12-4,BECKETT>我们自己去就行了
<12-4,BECKETT>Uh, you know what? I think we can manage.

494
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,400
<12-5,CASTLE>要香槟吗
<12-5,CASTLE>Champagne?

495
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,470
<12-6,BECKETT>我在工作呢
<12-6,BECKETT>I'm on duty.

496
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,790
<12-7,CASTLE>一声叹息  我只好独饮了
<12-7,CASTLE>Ah, alas, I'm forced to drink alone.

497
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,940
<12-8,BECKETT>安吉莉卡·亨利
<12-8,BECKETT>Angelica Henley.

498
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,810
<12-8,BECKETT>是安赫莉卡
<12-8,BECKETT>Anhelica.

499
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,230
<12-9,ANGELICA HENLEY>里面的G不发音
<12-9,ANGELICA HENLEY>The "G" Is silent.

500
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,020
<12-10,CASTLE>那不就是安莉卡了吗
<12-10,CASTLE>Wouldn't that make it Anelica?

501
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,350
<12-10,CASTLE>是安赫莉卡
<12-10,CASTLE>Anhelica.

502
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,360
<12-11,ANGELICA>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<12-11,ANGELICA>Well, I'm Detective Kate Beckett,

503
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,990
<12-12,BECKETT>这位是卡塞尔先生
<12-12,BECKETT>And this is Mr. Castle.

504
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,510
<12-12,BECKETT>我们能谈谈吗
<12-12,BECKETT>Could we have a word?

505
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,160
<13-1,ANGELICA>究竟所为何事  我还有客人
<13-1,ANGELICA>What's all this about? I have guests.

506
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,680
<13-2,BECKETT>我知道您雇了一位叫约翰·弗莱明的人
<13-2,BECKETT>Now I understand that you employed a man named Johan Fleming.

507
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,200
<13-3,ANGELICA>是的  可怜的孩子死的时候我心都碎了
<13-3,ANGELICA>Yes, and I was so heartbroken when the poor boy died.

508
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,040
<13-4,BECKETT>您知道他的真名叫温德尔·杜普利吗
<13-4,BECKETT>Well, were you aware that his real name was Wendell Dupree?

509
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,440
<13-5,ANGELICA>我不知道
<13-5,ANGELICA>No, I wasn't.

510
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,060
<13-6,CASTLE>他有没有什么仇家
<13-6,CASTLE>Did he have any enemies?

511
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,880
<13-7,ANGELICA>没有  我不这么认为
<13-7,ANGELICA>No, I-I don't think so.

512
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,330
<13-7,ANGELICA>慢着  你说他叫温德尔
<13-7,ANGELICA>Wait. You mean, his-- his name was Wendell?

513
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:08,320
<13-8,BECKETT>他是不是惹了麻烦
<13-8,BECKETT>Was he in trouble?

514
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,890
<13-8,BECKETT>还是参与了什么不法活动
<13-8,BECKETT>Was he involved in any illegal activities.

515
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,450
<13-9,ANGELICA>不  没有  警察已经给他澄清了
<13-9,ANGELICA>No, no, no. The police cleared him.

516
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,370
<13-10,BECKETT>澄清什么
<13-10,BECKETT>Of what?

517
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,100
<13-11,ANGELICA>他死的前两天  我遭劫了
<13-11,ANGELICA>Oh, well, two days before he died, I was robbed.

518
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,450
<13-11,ANGELICA>有人闯进了我家  撬了我的壁式保险箱
<13-11,ANGELICA>Somebody broke in here and cracked my wall safe.

519
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
<13-12,CASTLE>劫匪拿走了什么
<13-12,CASTLE>What did they take?

520
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,350
<13-13,ANGELICA>我那条用粉钻打造的手镯
<13-13,ANGELICA>My bracelet made out of pink diamonds

<13-13,ANGELICA>that was worth over $4 million.

522

<13-14,CASTLE>温德尔偷了那条手镯
<13-14,CASTLE>Wendell stole the bracelet.

523
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,100
<13-15,BECKETT>就放在储物仓库里
<13-15,BECKETT>That's what's in the storage unit.

524
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,450
<13-15,BECKETT>这就是他命丧黄泉的原因
<13-15,BECKETT>That's why he was killed.

525
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,570
<14-2,ALEXIS>你有什么好欣喜若狂的

<14-3,CASTLE>我发达了
<14-3,CASTLE>I'm rich.

529
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,230

<14-3,CASTLE>Or richer.

530
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,290

<14-4,ALEXIS>Till Detective Beckett takes it from you

531
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,060
<14-4,ALEXIS>归还给真正的物主
<14-4,ALEXIS>and returns it to its rightful owner.

532
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,210
<14-5,CASTLE>也对  不过这也破坏不了我的好心情
<14-5,CASTLE>Yes, but not even that can ruin my day

533
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,090
<14-5,CASTLE>因为今晚

<14-7,CASTLE>to get reservations--

541
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,250
<14-8,ALEXIS>你要是这么在意预订的位子
<14-8,ALEXIS>If it's the reservations you care so much about,

543
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,230
<14-9,CASTLE>等一下  阿丽克西斯  我不是
<14-9,CASTLE>Hold on, Alexis. That's not...

544
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,390
<14-9,CASTLE>我不是
<14-9,CASTLE>That's not--

545
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,630
<14-10,CASTLE>我不是那个意思
<14-10,CASTLE>that's not what I meant.

546
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,920
<15-1,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯讨厌我
<15-1,BECKETT>Alexis hates me?

547
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,860
<15-1,BECKETT>因为我们在一起了
<15-1,BECKETT>Is it because we're together?

548
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,810
<15-2,CASTLE>我猜她可能觉得自己被取代了
<15-2,CASTLE>I guess she feels like she's being replaced,

549
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,540
<15-2,CASTLE>说来也怪
<15-2,CASTLE>which is weird

550
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,740
<15-2,CASTLE>她以前从不这样的
<15-2,CASTLE>because she's never done this before--

551
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,480
<15-2,CASTLE>对吉娜不会
<15-2,CASTLE>not with Gina,

552
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,690
<15-2,CASTLE>对我以前成群的超正女友都不会
<15-2,CASTLE>not with the hundreds of super-hot girlfriends I've--

553
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,880
<15-3,BECKETT>行了  我不想听
<15-3,BECKETT>Okay, I don't need to hear this.

554
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,900
<15-4,CASTLE>好吧
<15-4,CASTLE>Right.

555
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,510
<15-5,BECKETT>你觉得我该跟她谈谈吗
<15-5,BECKETT>So do you think I should talk to her?

556
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,080
<15-5,BECKETT>不  不行
<15-5,BECKETT>No, no, no, no.

557
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,210
<15-6,CASTLE>不行  她会把你给生吞活剥了
<15-6,CASTLE>No, she'll eat you alive.

558
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,250
<15-6,CASTLE>我来处理吧
<15-6,CASTLE>Let me handle it.

559
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,180
<15-7,ESPOSITO>处理什么
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Handle what?

560
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,420
<15-8,CASTLE>-没什么  -没什么
<15-8,CASTLE>- Nothing.  - Nothing.

561
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,310
<15-9,BECKETT>警员在彻查温德尔所有的遗物
<15-9,BECKETT>So... uniforms are going through Wendell's belongings,

562
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,230
<15-10,RYAN>想找到手镯
<15-10,RYAN>looking for the bracelet,

563
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,850
<15-10,RYAN>不过盗窃科终于把安吉莉卡·亨利家
<15-10,RYAN>but Robbery finally sent over the report

564
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,440
<15-10,RYAN>入室抢劫案的报告送过来了
<15-10,RYAN>on the break-in on Angelica Henley's.

565
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
<15-10,RYAN>看看这个
<15-10,RYAN>Take a look at these.

566
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,930
<15-11,CASTLE>美艳绝伦
<15-11,CASTLE>Wow. A real beauty.

567
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,480
<15-11,CASTLE>绝对值得为它去杀人
<15-11,CASTLE>Certainly worth killing for.

568
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,860
<15-11,CASTLE>未免某人胡思乱想
<15-11,CASTLE>I am speaking of the bracelet

569
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,340
<15-11,CASTLE>声明一下我说的是手镯
<15-11,CASTLE>in case anyone is wondering.

570
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,810
<15-12,RYAN>是两人作案  经验老到
<15-12,RYAN>It was a 2-man job, pretty sophisticated, too.

571
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,900
<15-12,RYAN>嫌犯之一在地下室的警报器上装了旁路
<15-12,RYAN>One suspect put a bypass on the alarm in the basement.

572
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,050
<15-13,ESPOSITO>另一个从屋顶沿绳而下
<15-13,ESPOSITO>The other rappelled from the roof

573
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,130
<15-13,ESPOSITO>从窗口进去
<15-13,ESPOSITO>And went in through the window.

574
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,320
<15-14,CASTLE>这就解释了那些攀爬器械存在的原因
<15-14,CASTLE>Which explains the climbing equipment you had your eye on.

575
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,170
<15-15,BECKETT>温德尔在偷走钻石手镯后
<15-15,BECKETT>So Wendell was suspiciously hit by a train

576
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,000
<15-15,BECKETT>很可疑地被火车撞死
<15-15,BECKETT>after stealing a diamond bracelet,

577
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,950
<15-15,BECKETT>六个星期之后
<15-15,BECKETT>and then six weeks later,

578
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,090
<15-15,BECKETT>他的妹妹试图寻找他的储物仓库
<15-15,BECKETT>his sister goes looking for his storage unit,

579
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,350
<15-15,BECKETT>结果也死了
<15-15,BECKETT>and she ends up dead.

580
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,780
<15-16,CASTLE>有没有可能是"盗亦无道"  自相残杀
<15-16,CASTLE>What if it's a "no honor among thieves" thing?

581
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,170
<15-16,CASTLE>你说过行窃需要两个人
<15-16,CASTLE>You said it was a 2-man job.

582
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,610
<15-16,CASTLE>有没有可能是温德尔的同伙
<15-16,CASTLE>What if Wendell's partner decided

583
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,780
<15-16,CASTLE>决定独吞手镯
<15-16,CASTLE>that he wanted the bracelet for himself,

584
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,750
<15-16,CASTLE>只是他在还没弄清温德尔
<15-16,CASTLE>only he killed Wendell

585
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,290
<15-16,CASTLE>藏匿手镯的地点就把他杀了
<15-16,CASTLE>before he figured out where he'd stashed it?

586
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,790
<15-17,BECKETT>所以他跟踪了温蒂  她领他到储物仓库
<15-17,BECKETT>So he follows Wendy, she leads him to the storage unit,

587
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,800
<15-17,BECKETT>他又把她杀了
<15-17,BECKETT>and then he kills her.

588
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,210
<15-18,ESPOSITO>找到同伙  就找到凶手了
<15-18,ESPOSITO>Find the partner, find the killer.

589
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,470
<15-19,BECKETT>也许我们已经找到他了
<15-19,BECKETT>Well, maybe we already found him.

590
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,810
<15-20,RYAN>什么意思
<15-20,RYAN>What do you mean?

591
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,540
<15-21,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你还记得竞拍时
<15-21,BECKETT>Castle, do you remember at the auction,

592
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,320
<15-21,BECKETT>所有竞价者在价格抬到1500美元时就放弃了竞拍
<15-21,BECKETT>all of the bidders dropped out after $1,500?

593
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,270
<15-22,CASTLE>除了那个人
<15-22,CASTLE>Except one.

594
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,670
<15-23,BECKETT>他知道里面有什么
<15-23,BECKETT>He knew what was inside.

595
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,440
<15-24,CASTLE>不然为什么会出那么高的价格
<15-24,CASTLE>Why else would he bid so high?

596
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,520
<16-1,BECKETT>菲利克斯·格泽林恩  纽约警局

<16-3,ESPOSITO>He's making a run for it.

<16-7,ESPOSITO>Drop it.

604
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,460
<17-1,FELIX>我以为你们是来偷东西的贼
<17-1,FELIX>I thought you were thieves trying to steal my stuff.

605
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,740
<17-1,FELIX>我完全不知道那仓库里有什么
<17-1,FELIX>I had absolutely no idea what was in the storage unit. It's--

606
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,590
<17-2,BECKETT>但你却异于他人
<17-2,BECKETT>Yet, unlike anyone else there,

607
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,350
<17-2,BECKETT>把价格抬得超高
<17-2,BECKETT>you bid us through the roof.

608
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,750
<17-3,FELIX>小姐  那叫技巧  我竞拍过许多东西
<17-3,FELIX>Lady, that's strategy. I-I bid on a lot of things.

609
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,950
<17-3,FELIX>那是我的生财之道
<17-3,FELIX>That's how I make my money.

610
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,000
<17-4,ESPOSITO>这么说你出售这些东西
<17-4,ESPOSITO>So you actually... sell this stuff?

611
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,190
<17-5,FELIX>还没
<17-5,FELIX>Not yet.

612

<17-5,FELIX>我还在整货  记录分类
<17-5,FELIX>I'm still organizing, cataloging.

613
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,650
<17-5,FELIX>收集什么  竞拍什么
<17-5,FELIX>There's a method to all of this--

614
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,220
<17-5,FELIX>都是讲究方式方法的
<17-5,FELIX>you know, what I collect, what I bid on.

615
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,610
<17-6,BECKETT>特别是在你有内线消息的时候
<17-6,BECKETT>Especially when you got inside information.

616
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,220
<17-6,BECKETT>你知道那仓库里有什么
<17-6,BECKETT>You knew exactly what was in that unit.

617
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,360
<17-6,BECKETT>不  我不知道
<17-6,BECKETT>No, I didn't.

618
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,330
<17-7,FELIX>我想起
<17-7,FELIX>Yeah, you know, I was thinking,

619
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,060
<7-1,MANAGER>当我报名参加竞拍的时候
<7-1,MANAGER>when I signed up for the auction,

620
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,300
<17-7,FELIX>有个男人
<17-7,FELIX>there was a guy.

621
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,200
<17-7,FELIX>他出五百块钱请我替他
<17-7,FELIX>Yeah, offered me $500 to be his proxy,

622
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,980
<17-7,FELIX>去竞拍317号
<17-7,FELIX>get unit 317.

623
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,660

<17-7,FELIX>Very specific. 317.

624
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,760
<17-8,ESPOSITO>你怎么回答的
<17-8,ESPOSITO>And what did you say?

625
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,920
<17-9,FELIX>我拒绝了
<17-9,FELIX>I said no.

<17-9,FELIX>就五百块  我不缺那点钱
<17-9,FELIX>$500? I'm not in for the short money.

627
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,200
<17-9,FELIX>但这使我很好奇
<17-9,FELIX>It made me curious.

628
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,830
<17-9,FELIX>为什么非要317
<17-9,FELIX>317. Why?

629
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,080
<17-10,BECKETT>那人应该就是温德尔的同伙
<17-10,BECKETT>That was probably Wendell's partner.

630
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,170
<17-12,BECKETT>他在竞拍现场吗
<17-12,BECKETT>And was he at the auction?

631
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,500
<17-13,FELIX>不  不在  我后来再没见过他
<17-13,FELIX>No. No, no, no, no. I never saw him again.

632
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,390
<17-14,BECKETT>我们要带你回去见见人像画师
<17-14,BECKETT>We're gonna need you to sit with a sketch artist.

<18-4,CASTLE>猜我找到了什么
<18-4,CASTLE>You know what I found?

<18-6,CASTLE>I don't get it.

649
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,360
<18-7,BECKETT>这些证据  杀死温蒂的凶手
<18-7,BECKETT>All of the evidence, Wendy's murder--

650
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,810
<18-7,BECKETT>一切线索都显示
<18-7,BECKETT>everything points to the fact that

651
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,490
<18-7,BECKETT>手镯就在仓库里
<18-7,BECKETT>that bracelet should be in there.

652
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,490
<18-8,CASTLE>但是它不在
<18-8,CASTLE>Well, it's not.

653
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,420
<18-8,CASTLE>但在这期间  我想出了一些
<18-8,CASTLE>I did, however, make some headway

654
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,130
<18-8,CASTLE>关于你的那个小棍人的故事
<18-8,CASTLE>on my little stick man theory.

655
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,540
<18-9,BECKETT>是吗
<18-9,BECKETT>Really?

656
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,780
<18-10,CASTLE>是的  当你还是制服警员的时候
<18-10,CASTLE>Yes. Whilst you were still an officer,

657
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,800
<18-10,CASTLE>你曾不顾自身危险  冲入车流
<18-10,CASTLE>you risked your life running into traffic

658
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,270
<18-10,CASTLE>救了一个吉普赛老妪
<18-10,CASTLE>to save an old gypsy woman.

659
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,180
<18-11,BECKETT>一个吉普赛女人
<18-11,BECKETT>A gypsy woman?

660
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,070
<18-10,CASTLE>吉普赛老妪
<18-10,CASTLE>An old gypsy woman.

661
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,660
<18-12,CASTLE>为了奖励你的英勇
<18-12,CASTLE>To reward your bravery,

662
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,220
<18-12,CASTLE>她给了你一个护身符
<18-12,CASTLE>she gave you a talisman.

663
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,100
<18-12,CASTLE>她说  只要你带着它
<18-12,CASTLE>She said, as long as you keep it.

664
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,590
<18-13,BECKETT>你就不会受到伤害
<18-13,BECKETT>No harm will ever befall you.

665
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,680
<18-13,BECKETT>我就不会受到伤害
<18-13,BECKETT>No harm will ever befall me?

666
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,250
<18-14,CASTLE>我觉得你看起来挺健全的呀
<18-14,CASTLE>You look all right to me.

667
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,280
<18-14,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生
<18-14,CASTLE>So, Mr. Castle,

668
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,870
<18-15,GATES>我决定拜读你的《冰冻希特》
<18-15,GATES>I decided to give "Frozen Heat" a read,

669
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,830
<18-15,GATES>你知道吗
<18-15,GATES>and you know what?

670
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,680
<18-15,GATES>真是本好书
<18-15,GATES>It's really a good book.

671
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,250
<18-16,CASTLE>你喜欢吗
<18-16,CASTLE>You liked it?

672
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,270
<18-17,GATES>我爱死了
<18-17,GATES>I loved it.

673
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,270
<18-17,GATES>-你介意签个名吗  -不
<18-17,GATES>- I, uh, do you mind? - No.

674
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,950
<18-19,GATES>我已经订购了妮基·希特系列其他的几本
<18-19,GATES>I-I ordered the rest of the Nikki Heat series.

675
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,890
<18-20,GATES>再次感谢你
<18-20,GATES>And, again, thank you

676
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,560
<18-20,GATES>把娃娃送给我
<18-20,GATES>for my gemini collectible.

677
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,290
<18-20,GATES>现在我的收藏完整了
<18-20,GATES>I now have a complete set.

678
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,380
<18-21,CASTLE>看见了吗
<18-21,CASTLE>You see that?

679
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,430
<18-21,CASTLE>现在她爱死我了
<18-21,CASTLE>She loves me now,

680
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,570
<18-21,CASTLE>这都要感谢那个阴森森的小娃娃
<18-21,CASTLE>and I've got that scary little monstrosity to thank for it.

681
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,400
<18-22,RYAN>伙计们  来看看这个
<18-22,RYAN>Hey, guys. You need to see this.

682
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,800
<19-1,RYAN>抢劫组的同事查过一个叫马可·温斯特利的人
<19-1,RYAN>So robbery interviewed a guy named Marco Vinstrolli.

683
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,590
<19-1,RYAN>安吉莉卡手镯被偷的那晚  他在那个街角
<19-1,RYAN>His van got a parking ticket around the corner

684
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,640
<19-1,RYAN>得到一张违规停车的罚单
<19-1,RYAN>the night that Angelica's bracelet was stolen.

685
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,970
<19-1,RYAN>现在还无法将他和案子联系起来  但是
<19-1,RYAN>Now they found nothing to connect him, but...

686
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
<19-2,RYAN>很像吧
<19-2,RYAN>Look familiar?

687
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,010
<19-3,BECKETT>就是他
<19-3,BECKETT>That's our guy.

688
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,500
<19-4,RYAN>仓库管理员说在拍卖的前一天
<19-4,RYAN>The storage manager said that he rented Marco a unit

689
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,640
<19-4,RYAN>他租给马可同一层的一个单元
<19-4,RYAN>on the same floor the day before the auction.

690
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,430
<19-4,RYAN>于是我过了一遍监控录像
<19-4,RYAN>So I-I reviewed their surveillance tapes.

691
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,860
<19-4,RYAN>这是昨天早上六点的录像
<19-4,RYAN>This is from 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning.

692
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,160
<19-4,RYAN>也就是拍卖前的五小时
<19-4,RYAN>Five hours before the auction.

693
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,890
<19-5,CASTLE>他闯进了我的储物仓库
<19-5,CASTLE>He broke into my storage unit.

694
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,300
<19-5,CASTLE>好吧  那时还是温德尔的
<19-5,CASTLE>Well, it's--it was Wendell's at the time,

695
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,440
<19-5,CASTLE>但现在是我的
<19-5,CASTLE>but now it's mine.

696
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,470
<19-5,CASTLE>那是保险箱吗
<19-5,CASTLE>Is that a safe?

697
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,710
<19-6,BECKETT>正是如此我们才找不到你的手镯
<19-6,BECKETT>That's why we couldn't find your bracelet.

698
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,900
<19-6,BECKETT>因为它在保险箱里
<19-6,BECKETT>Because it was in the safe.

699
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,810
<19-7,CASTLE>我的保险箱
<19-7,CASTLE>My safe.

700
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,890
<19-8,BECKETT>拿到对那车的搜查证了吗
<19-8,BECKETT>So do we have a license on that van?

701
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,190
<20-2,ESPOSITO>放下手中的东西
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Put it down, dirtbag!

702
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,200
<20-3,BECKETT>纽约警察  立刻举起双手
<20-3,BECKETT>NYPD, put up your hands right now!

703
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,610
<20-3,BECKETT>马可  立刻放下你的工具
<20-3,BECKETT>Take your hand off your tool, Marco.

704
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,090
<20-4,BECKETT>不许说话
<20-4,BECKETT>Shut up.

705
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,630
<21-1,BECKETT>马可  我们知道你和温德尔曾是搭档
<21-1,BECKETT>Marco, we know that you and Wendell were partners.

706
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,410
<21-1,BECKETT>你们行窃的时候  车被贴了罚单
<21-1,BECKETT>Your van was ticketed when you guys pulled the job.

707
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,760
<21-2,ESPOSITO>劫案组之前没法证明
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Robbery couldn't prove it before,

708
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,790
<21-2,ESPOSITO>但是现在我们掌握了这些  所以抓到你了
<21-2,ESPOSITO>but now with these, well, we got you.

709
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,970
<21-3,MARCO>在我看来你们抓我似乎只是因为
<21-3,MARCO>Well, it seems to me like all you've got me for

710
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,220
<21-3,MARCO>我偷了保险箱
<21-3,MARCO>is stealing a safe.

711
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,990
<21-3,MARCO>这能判多长时间啊  30天吗
<21-3,MARCO>What's the punishment for that, 30 days?

712
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,470
<21-4,BECKETT>等我们加上
<21-4,BECKETT>More like 30 years

713
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,090
<21-4,BECKETT>温德尔和温蒂的谋杀指控后  我看30年还差不多
<21-4,BECKETT>after we add Wendell and Wendy's murders to it.

714
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:22,880
<21-5,MARCO>谋杀
<21-5,MARCO>Murder?

715
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,810
<21-6,BECKETT>我还是老实招供吧
<21-6,BECKETT>Why don't you tell us exactly what happened,

716
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,450
<21-6,BECKETT>我们会让地检官给你提供减罪协议
<21-6,BECKETT>and we'll get the D.A. to cut you a deal?

717
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,240
<21-6,BECKETT>但是你最好抓紧点
<21-6,BECKETT>But you better hurry,

718
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
<21-6,BECKETT>因为他们正在切开那个保险箱
<21-6,BECKETT>because they're cutting through that safe,

719
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,860
<21-6,BECKETT>一旦他们发现了钻石手镯
<21-6,BECKETT>and when they find that diamond bracelet,

720
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,760
<21-6,BECKETT>你怎么求情都没用
<21-6,BECKETT>you're on your own.

721
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,610
<22-1,CASTLE>你知道我喜欢这案子哪点吗
<22-1,CASTLE>You know what I love about this case?

722
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,820
<22-2,RYAN>哪点
<22-2,RYAN>What's that?

723
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,980
<22-3,CASTLE>在我的物品里寻找漂亮的粉色手镯
<22-3,CASTLE>Finding a pretty pink bracelet in my belongings.

724
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,830
<22-4,RYAN>你知道我们得把它还给
<22-4,RYAN>You know you're gonna have to return that--

725
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,090
<22-4,RYAN>我知道  莱恩
<22-4,RYAN>I know, Ryan.

726
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,940
<22-5,CASTLE>我知道
<22-5,CASTLE>I know that.

727
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,320
<22-5,CASTLE>你就不能让我享受
<22-5,CASTLE>Can't you just let me have this moment,

728
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,440
<22-5,CASTLE>这个《金银岛》混搭
<22-5,CASTLE>this one small, "Treasure island,"

729
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,300
<22-5,CASTLE>《夺宝奇兵》的时刻吗
<22-5,CASTLE>Indiana Jones moment?

730
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,770
<22-6,RYAN>抱歉  知道了
<22-6,RYAN>Sorry. You got it.

731
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,240
<22-7,CASTLE>太晚了  已经被你毁了
<22-7,CASTLE>Well, it's too late now. It's ruined.

732
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,840
<23-1,MARCO>我只是帮助他闯入那个阁楼
<23-1,MARCO>All I did was help him break in to that penthouse.

733
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,040
<23-1,MARCO>我发誓
<23-1,MARCO>I swear to god,

734
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,100
<23-1,MARCO>我都不认识那个人
<23-1,MARCO>I didn't even know the guy.

735
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,650
<23-1,MARCO>约翰或是温德尔
<23-1,MARCO>Johan or Wendell,

736
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,740
<23-1,MARCO>管他叫什么  给了我五千美金
<23-1,MARCO>whatever, paid me 5 grand

737
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,740
<23-1,MARCO>关掉报警器  什么问题都不问
<23-1,MARCO>to kill the alarms, no questions asked.

738
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,260
<23-1,MARCO>我们成功后  他很高兴
<23-1,MARCO>We did the job, he came out happy,

739
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,130
<23-1,MARCO>说"任务完成"  我们就分道扬镳了
<23-1,MARCO>said "Mission accomplished," we went separate ways.

740
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,830
<23-2,BECKETT>可是你还是想要那个手镯
<23-2,BECKETT>Except you still wanted the bracelet.

741
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,760
<23-2,BECKETT>所以你就杀了他
<23-2,BECKETT>So you went after him and you killed him.

742
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,090
<23-3,MARCO>我根本都不知道他拿走了那个该死的手镯
<23-3,MARCO>I didn't even know that he took that damn bracelet

743
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,270
<23-3,MARCO>直到我在报纸上看到
<23-3,MARCO>until I read about it in the papers.

744
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,140
<23-3,MARCO>那时候他已经死了
<23-3,MARCO>And by that time, he was already dead.

745
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,880
<23-3,MARCO>所以我就闯入温德尔家
<23-3,MARCO>So I broke into Wendell's,

746
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,890
<23-3,MARCO>但我只找到一把标记着"储物仓库"的钥匙
<23-3,MARCO>but all I found was a key, marked "Storage unit."

747
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,900
<23-4,ESPOSITO>但你不知道储物仓库在哪
<23-4,ESPOSITO>And you didn't know where that storage unit was.

748
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,390
<23-5,MARCO>所以我就密切关注即将举办的拍卖
<23-5,MARCO>So I kept a close eye on upcoming auctions

749
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,800
<23-5,MARCO>后来我就找到了写着约翰名字的
<23-5,MARCO>until I found one with Johan's name.

750
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,310
<23-5,MARCO>我一看到里面的保险箱我就知道
<23-5,MARCO>As soon as I saw the safe inside, I knew...

751
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,830
<23-5,MARCO>他将钻石手镯放在了那里
<23-5,MARCO>that's where he had stashed that diamond bracelet.

752
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,210
<24-1,CASTLE>我爱死这一刻了
<24-1,CASTLE>Oh, I love this part--

753
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,390
<24-1,CASTLE>肾上腺素激增
<24-1,CASTLE>The kick of adrenaline,

754
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,720
<24-1,CASTLE>心跳加快
<24-1,CASTLE>the quickening of the heart,

755
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,730
<24-1,CASTLE>期望即将实现
<24-1,CASTLE>those last few drops of anticipation.

756
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,410
<24-1,CASTLE>是空的
<24-1,CASTLE>It's empty.

757
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,860
<24-1,CASTLE>那手镯在哪
<24-1,CASTLE>So where is the bracelet?

758
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,300
<25-1,BECKETT>不管它在哪  一定在嘲笑我
<25-1,BECKETT>Wherever it is, it's laughing at me.

759
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,770
<25-2,CASTLE>也许马可搞错了
<25-2,CASTLE>Maybe Marco was wrong,

760
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,050
<25-3,ESPOSITO>温德尔死前就把手镯出手了
<25-3,ESPOSITO>and Wendell sold it before he was killed.

761
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,750
<25-4,RYAN>那卖手镯的钱去哪了
<25-4,RYAN>Well, then where's the money from the sale?

762
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,160
<25-4,RYAN>没有钱说明手镯应该还在
<25-4,RYAN>No money means there should be a bracelet.

763
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,030
<25-4,RYAN>没有手镯说明应该有钱
<25-4,RYAN>No bracelet means there should be money.

764
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,090
<25-5,CASTLE>我觉得我们应该问的问题是  温德尔是怎么
<25-5,CASTLE>I think the question we should be asking is, how did Wendell

765
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,940
<25-5,CASTLE>开始实施这个盗窃计划的
<25-5,CASTLE>even pull off a heist like this to begin with?

766
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,200
<25-5,CASTLE>安吉莉卡说小偷弄开了壁式保险箱
<25-5,CASTLE>Angelica said that the thief cracked the wall safe.

767
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,490
<25-5,CASTLE>你知道弄开壁式保险箱得有多难吗
<25-5,CASTLE>Do you know how hard it is to crack a wall safe?

768
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,730
<25-5,CASTLE>特别考虑到温德尔的储物仓库里都没有
<25-5,CASTLE>Especially since Wendell didn't even have

769
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,220
<25-5,CASTLE>任何适合的工具  这...
<25-5,CASTLE>any of the proper equipment in his storage unit. It just--

770
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,280
<25-6,ESPOSITO>说不通吗
<25-6,ESPOSITO>Doesn't make any sense?

771
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,470
<25-7,CASTLE>谢谢
<25-7,CASTLE>Thank you.

772
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,210
<25-8,BECKETT>除非安吉莉卡没有跟我们说实话
<25-8,BECKETT>Unless Angelica wasn't telling us the truth.

773
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,640
<26-1,BECKETT>看看这个
<26-1,BECKETT>Listen to this--

774
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,620
<26-1,BECKETT>一周前安吉莉卡本应出席破产听证会
<26-1,BECKETT>Angelica was scheduled for a bankruptcy hearing a week ago,

775
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,870
<26-1,BECKETT>但是听证会被取消了  因为她向债权人
<26-1,BECKETT>but it was canceled because she made a $2-million payment

776
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,810
<26-1,BECKETT>支付了两百万
<26-1,BECKETT>to her creditors.

777
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,310
<26-2,CASTLE>恰好是在保险公司赔偿了她
<26-2,CASTLE>That's right after the insurance company

778
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,160
<26-2,CASTLE>手镯的赔偿金之后
<26-2,CASTLE>paid her claim on the bracelet.

779
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,340
<26-2,CASTLE>如果整件事情
<26-2,CASTLE>What if this whole thing

780
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,870
<26-2,CASTLE>是有预谋的保险诈骗呢
<26-2,CASTLE>was a ploy to commit insurance fraud?

781
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,400
<26-3,BECKETT>"任务完成"
<26-3,BECKETT>"Mission accomplished."

782
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,860
<26-3,BECKETT>温德尔入室成功后是这么说的
<26-3,BECKETT>That's what Wendell said after the break-in.

783
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,600
<26-3,BECKETT>"任务完成"
<26-3,BECKETT>"Mission accomplished."

784
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,080
<26-4,CASTLE>没错  他没说他到底要偷什么
<26-4,CASTLE>Right. He didn't say he actually stole anything.

785
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,220
<26-4,CASTLE>任务就是要制造出盗窃的假象
<26-4,CASTLE>The mission was to make it look like a robbery.

786
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,930
<26-5,BECKETT>而制造假象
<26-5,BECKETT>And the best way to make it look real,

787
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,190
<26-5,BECKETT>欺骗警察和保险公司的最佳办法
<26-5,BECKETT>to fool the police and the insurance company...

788
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,800
<26-6,CASTLE>就是真的入室但却不偷任何东西
<26-6,CASTLE>Is to actually break in yet steal nothing.

789
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
<26-6,CASTLE>安吉莉卡设计了这整件事
<26-6,CASTLE>Angelica set this whole thing up.

790
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,390
<26-7,BECKETT>唯一的知情人就是温德尔
<26-7,BECKETT>And the only other person that knew was Wendell.

791
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,190
<26-8,CASTLE>她无法承担那对姐弟泄露秘密的风险
<26-8,CASTLE>She couldn't afford to let him or his sister expose her secret.

792
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,720
<26-9,BECKETT>我认为那算杀人动机
<26-9,BECKETT>I call that motive for murder

793
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,290
<26-9,BECKETT>可以据此申请搜查令
<26-9,BECKETT>and probable cause for a search warrant.

794
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,270
<26-10,CASTLE>干得好
<26-10,CASTLE>Good work.

795
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,300
<26-10,CASTLE>谢谢
<26-10,CASTLE>Thank you.

796
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,990
<27-1,KIRBY>抱歉  亨利女士  他们硬闯进来的
<27-1,KIRBY>I'm sorry, Ms. Henley. They just barged in.

797
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,500
<27-1,KIRBY>我试过阻止他们
<27-1,KIRBY>I tried to stop them.

798
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,800
<27-2,ANGELICA>你们没有理由搜查我的住所
<27-2,ANGELICA>You people have no grounds to search my residence.

799
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,980
<27-3,ESPOSITO>事实上  我们有
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Actually... we do.

800
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,050
<27-4,ANGELICA>这真令人发指
<27-4,ANGELICA>This is outrageous.

801
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,870
<27-4,ANGELICA>没错  确实令人发指
<27-4,ANGELICA>She's right. This is outrageous.

802
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,280
<27-5,CASTLE>知道你应该做什么吗
<27-5,CASTLE>You know what you should do?

803
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,000
<27-5,CASTLE>打开壁式保险箱  证明我们是错的
<27-5,CASTLE>Open that wall safe and prove us wrong.

804
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,510
<27-6,RYAN>好吧  如果你想  我们也能从墙里撬出来
<27-6,RYAN>Fine. We can just tear it out of the wall if you'd like.

805
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,830
<27-7,ANGELICA>不不不
<27-7,ANGELICA>No, no, no, no, no, no.

806
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,920
<27-8,CASTLE>在里面吗
<27-8,CASTLE>Well, is it there?

807
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,340
<27-9,CASTLE>你好  尤物
<27-9,CASTLE>Hello, gorgeous.

808
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,670
<28-1,BECKETT>这件小美物可惹了不少麻烦  不是吗
<28-1,BECKETT>This little beauty has caused a lot of trouble, hasn't it?

809
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,630
<28-2,ANGELICA>美丽的东西就会这样  亲爱的
<28-2,ANGELICA>That's what beautiful things do, my dear,

810
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
<28-2,ANGELICA>至少我是这么认为的
<28-2,ANGELICA>at least to me.

811
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,610
<28-3,BECKETT>那为什么你不把它卖了
<28-3,BECKETT>So why didn't you just sell it

812
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,950
<28-3,BECKETT>以解决所有的财政问题
<28-3,BECKETT>and solve all your money problems

813
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,090
<28-3,BECKETT>而是雇温德尔伪造一起盗窃案
<28-3,BECKETT>instead of hiring Wendell to stage a robbery?

814
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,630
<28-4,ANGELICA>我没雇温德尔
<28-4,ANGELICA>I didn't hire Wendell.

815
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,380
<28-4,ANGELICA>你告诉我之前  我甚至不知道
<28-4,ANGELICA>I didn't even know he was involved in all of this

816
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,330
<28-4,ANGELICA>他也牵扯在内
<28-4,ANGELICA>until you told me.

817
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,520
<28-5,BECKETT>就是说他入室当晚  你打电话报警
<28-5,BECKETT>So the fact that he broke in the same night that you called

818
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,910
<28-5,BECKETT>说手镯被偷了
<28-5,BECKETT>and reported this stolen,

819
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,620
<28-5,BECKETT>也只是个巧合吗
<28-5,BECKETT>that's just a coincidence?

820
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,240
<28-6,ANGELICA>当我回到家
<28-6,ANGELICA>Look, when I came home

821
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,440
<28-6,ANGELICA>看见公寓被盗之后
<28-6,ANGELICA>and saw that my apartment had been burglarized,

822
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,600
<28-6,ANGELICA>我恐慌至极  震惊万分
<28-6,ANGELICA>I was-- I was panicked, shocked.

823
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,340
<28-6,ANGELICA>但我发现没有东西被偷
<28-6,ANGELICA>Until I saw that nothing had been taken.

824
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,240
<28-6,ANGELICA>于是我想不如
<28-6,ANGELICA>So I thought that if I

825
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,290
<28-6,ANGELICA>就假装自己的手镯被盗
<28-6,ANGELICA>simply pretended that my bracelet had been stolen,

826
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,950
<28-6,ANGELICA>这样能解决我所有的问题
<28-6,ANGELICA>it would solve all my problems.

827
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,350
<28-7,BECKETT>可你又制造出了两个新问题
<28-7,BECKETT>Except you created two new problems--

828
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,200
<28-7,BECKETT>你的司机和他的姐姐
<28-7,BECKETT>your chauffer and his sister--

829
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,490
<28-7,BECKETT>都死了
<28-7,BECKETT>both of whom are now dead.

830
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,800
<28-8,ANGELICA>我想我该加律师来了
<28-8,ANGELICA>I think it's time for me to call my attorney.

831
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,170
<29-1,BECKETT>她认了保险诈骗罪
<29-1,BECKETT>So she admitted to insurance fraud

832
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,230
<29-1,BECKETT>希望能避免谋杀的指控
<29-1,BECKETT>hoping to avoid murder charges.

833
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,740
<29-1,BECKETT>至少我觉得这是她玩的戏码
<29-1,BECKETT>At least I think that's her play.

834
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,320
<29-3,BECKETT>-你觉得  -对  她是个绝望的女人
<29-3,BECKETT>- You think? - Yeah, she's a desperate woman

835
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,050
<29-3,BECKETT>面临着即将失去的所有财富
<29-3,BECKETT>on the verge of losing her wealth.

836
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,980
<29-3,BECKETT>这无疑是对她判了死刑
<29-3,BECKETT>That's death to someone like her.

837
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,800
<29-3,BECKETT>她会愿意做任何事来避免这样
<29-3,BECKETT>She's probably willing to do anything to avoid it--

838
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,640
<29-3,BECKETT>比如撒谎  偷窃  诈骗
<29-3,BECKETT>lie, steal, cheat,

839
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,700
<29-3,BECKETT>甚至谋杀
<29-3,BECKETT>and in this case, kill.

840
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,810
<29-4,CASTLE>对  但那仍无法解释储物仓库的事
<29-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but that still doesn't explain the storage locker.

841
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,900
<29-4,CASTLE>如果温德尔没有偷任何东西
<29-4,CASTLE>I mean, if Wendell didn't steal anything,

842
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,070
<29-4,CASTLE>那他往里面放了什么
<29-4,CASTLE>what did he put in there

843
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,280
<29-4,CASTLE>会让他姐姐这么渴望拿到手
<29-4,CASTLE>that his sister was so desperate to get?

844
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,080
<29-4,CASTLE>而且如果这和她的谋杀案无关
<29-4,CASTLE>And if it didn't have anything to do with her murder,

845
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,100
<29-4,CASTLE>她为什么要用自己的血写下那个仓库号
<29-4,CASTLE>why would she write the locker number in her blood?

846
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,250
<29-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你仔细地
<29-5,BECKETT>Castle, you went through that storage unit

847
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,730
<29-5,BECKETT>检查了仓库里的东西
<29-5,BECKETT>with a fine-tooth comb.

848
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,510
<29-5,BECKETT>你说里面没有任何有价值的东西
<29-5,BECKETT>You said that there's nothing of value in there.

849
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,290
<29-6,CASTLE>没错  对我们来说没有价值
<29-6,CASTLE>Well, yeah, nothing of value to us.

850
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,420
<29-6,CASTLE>但如果对他们来说有价值呢
<29-6,CASTLE>But I mean, what about something of value to them?

851
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,620
<29-7,BECKETT>比如说
<29-7,BECKETT>Like what?

852
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,330
<29-8,CASTLE>我不知道  小饰品
<29-8,CASTLE>I don't know-- a trinket,

853
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,490
<29-8,CASTLE>或是传家宝
<29-8,CASTLE>an heirloom.

854
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,370
<29-8,CASTLE>答案就在那里的某处  一定在
<29-8,CASTLE>The answer's in there somewhere. It has to be.

855
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,490
<29-8,CASTLE>总之  时间不早了
<29-8,CASTLE>Anyway... It's getting late.

856
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,120
<29-8,CASTLE>明天第一件事是送阿丽克西斯去学校
<29-8,CASTLE>I have to drop off Alexis first thing in the morning.

857
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,930
<29-8,CASTLE>-明天再重新开始吧  -好
<29-8,CASTLE>- Fresh start tomorrow? - Sure.

865
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,860

<29-15,CASTLE>softly touching your face,

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,120
<30-3,MARTHA>好了  不说永别  不说再见
<30-3,MARTHA>All right, no farewells, no good-byes.

<30-6,CASTLE>All right.

884
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,660
<30-6,CASTLE>那个...
<30-6,CASTLE>So...

885
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,450
<30-7,CASTLE>这里就是你的新家了吗
<30-7,CASTLE>This is your new home, huh?

886
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,480
<30-8,CASTLE>听着  我理解
<30-8,CASTLE>Hey, look, I get it.

887
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,710
<30-8,CASTLE>真的
<30-8,CASTLE>I do.

888
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,050
<30-8,CASTLE>但无论我和贝克特之间发生了什么事
<30-8,CASTLE>But whatever happens between Beckett and me,

889
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,260
<30-8,CASTLE>我想让你知道  我们可能明天就分手
<30-8,CASTLE>I want you to know-- I mean, we could break up tomorrow,

890
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,850
<30-8,CASTLE>也可能会一起共度余生
<30-8,CASTLE>we could spend the rest of our lives together--

891
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,430
<30-8,CASTLE>但她绝不会取代你在我心中的位置
<30-8,CASTLE>but she will never take your place in my heart.

892
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,150
<30-9,ALEXIS>我为什么要担心贝克特警探会取代我
<30-9,ALEXIS>Why would I be worried about detective Beckett replacing me?

893
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,230
<30-10,CASTLE>你当时表现得...  我以为
<30-10,CASTLE>You were act-- I thought--

894
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,730
<30-11,ALEXIS>你是怎么做到智慧和愚蠢并重的
<30-11,ALEXIS>How can you be so smart and so clueless at the same time?

895
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,930
<30-12,CASTLE>多练练就好了
<30-12,CASTLE>Practice.

896
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,220
<30-13,ALEXIS>跟贝克特没什么关系
<30-13,ALEXIS>This is no more about Beckett

897
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
<30-13,ALEXIS>我就是觉得我妈怎么能不来
<30-13,ALEXIS>than it's about the fact my mother isn't here.

898
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,480
<30-14,CASTLE>-对不起  亲爱的  你妈她  -不
<30-14,CASTLE>- Sorry, honey, but your mom... - No.

901
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,930

<30-15,ALEXIS>我醒来时你都会在我旁边
<30-15,ALEXIS>I'd wake up, and you'd be there,

903
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,170
<30-15,ALEXIS>让我知道一切安好
<30-15,ALEXIS>and I'd know that everything's fine.

904
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,150
<30-16,CASTLE>现在你要住在这里了...
<30-16,CASTLE>Oh, and when you wake up here...

<30-17,ALEXIS>Even though there is only 5 miles away...

908

<30-17,ALEXIS>这里毕竟跟家不一样
<30-17,ALEXIS>it's not here.

909
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,190
<30-18,CASTLE>一切都会没事的
<30-18,CASTLE>Well, everything is going to be fine.

<32-1,CASTLE>不知道是什么东西  只知道它在哪
<32-1,CASTLE>I don't know what it is, only where it is.

931
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,720
<32-3,CASTLE>温德尔偷的东西只对自己
<32-3,CASTLE>Whatever Wendell stole was only of value to him

932
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,670
<32-3,CASTLE>和他的孪生姐姐有价值
<32-3,CASTLE>and his twin sister.

933
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,780
<32-3,CASTLE>所以他只会把东西藏在
<32-3,CASTLE>So he would hide it in the one place

934
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,280
<32-3,CASTLE>她会去找的地方
<32-3,CASTLE>only she would look.

<32-3,CASTLE>as in gemini collectibles.

937
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,470
<32-4,BECKETT>就是它了
<32-4,BECKETT>This is it.

940
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,950
<32-5,CASTLE>这不可能
<32-5,CASTLE>Oh, that can't be right.

<32-6,BECKETT>-怎么  -长官  呼吸
<32-6,BECKETT>- What-- - Oh, sir, just breathe.

<32-7,GATES>你到底干了什么
<32-7,GATES>What the hell have you done?

943
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,150
<32-8,CASTLE>我以为
<32-8,CASTLE>I thought--

944
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,100
<32-9,GATES>你以为什么  卡塞尔先生
<32-9,GATES>Y-you thought what, Mr. Castle?

945
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,470
<32-10,CASTLE>我以为温德尔会把他偷来的东西
<32-10,CASTLE>I just thought that Wendell would've hidden what he stole

946
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,960
<32-11,GATES>-放在双子  -这不是温德尔的那个  是我的
<32-11,GATES>- inside the gemini-- - It wasn't Wendell's. It was mine!

947

<32-12,CASTLE>好吧  我的错
<32-12,CASTLE>All right, that's my bad.

949
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,330
<32-13,CASTLE>等等  这说明
<32-13,CASTLE>Wait. That means...

950
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,710
<32-13,CASTLE>原来在这儿
<32-13,CASTLE>Ah. Here it is.

<32-15,CASTLE>我没想到会是这些东西
<32-15,CASTLE>I didn't see that coming.

<33-4,ESPOSITO>这些跟一只玻璃假眼有什么关系
<33-4,ESPOSITO>What does any of this have to do with a glass eye?

965
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,080
<33-5,RYAN>如果肇事车停下来打电话求救
<33-5,RYAN>and that if the person who hit them would've stopped

966
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,420
<33-5,RYAN>他们或许还能活下来
<33-5,RYAN>and called for help, they might have lived.

967
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,920
<33-5,RYAN>大伙  注意看照片
<33-5,RYAN>Hey, guys. Look at this photo.

968
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,440
<33-6,BECKETT>这也是犯罪现场的照片  一只破碎的玻璃假眼
<33-6,BECKETT>It's from the crime scene, and it's of a broken glass eye.

969
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,770
<33-7,ESPOSITO>什么
<33-7,ESPOSITO>What?

970
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,450
<33-7,ESPOSITO>玻璃假眼
<33-7,ESPOSITO>A glass eye?

971
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,760
<33-8,CASTLE>等等
<33-8,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

972
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,340
<33-8,CASTLE>现在一切都说得通了
<33-8,CASTLE>Of course. It all makes sense now.

973
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,430
<33-9,RYAN>是吗
<33-9,RYAN>It does?

974
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,890
<33-10,CASTLE>温德尔的痴迷
<33-10,CASTLE>Wendell's obsession--

975
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,430
<33-10,CASTLE>他为什么会不断搬家
<33-10,CASTLE>why he moved from place to place,

976
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,290
<33-10,CASTLE>为什么来到纽约  为什么用假名
<33-10,CASTLE>why he came to New York, why he used a fake name

977
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,010
<33-10,CASTLE>还有一本有关假体眼球的书
<33-10,CASTLE>and a had a book on prosthetic eyes.

978
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,040
<33-10,CASTLE>他在执行任务
<33-10,CASTLE>He was-- he was on a mission.

979
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,110
<33-11,ESPOSITO>什么任务
<33-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but on a mission to do what?

980
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,600
<33-12,CASTLE>找到害死自己父母的凶手
<33-12,CASTLE>Well, to find the person responsible for his parents' death.

981
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,480
<33-12,CASTLE>为了确认身份
<33-12,CASTLE>In order to be sure,

982
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,770
<33-12,CASTLE>温德尔不得不去偷嫌疑人的假眼
<33-12,CASTLE>Wendell had to steal the suspect's glass eye.

983
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,100
<33-12,CASTLE>所以才入室偷盗
<33-12,CASTLE>That's what the heist was about.

984
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,560
<33-13,BECKETT>就跟对比指纹一样  他拿这张照片去对比假眼
<33-13,BECKETT>And like fingerprints, he used that photo to compare the eyes.

985
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,760
<33-14,CASTLE>就像理查德·金布尔一样
<33-14,CASTLE>A la Richard Kimble,

986
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,050
<33-14,CASTLE>不过他要找的不是一个装义肢的男人
<33-14,CASTLE>but instead of looking for a one-armed man...

987
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,460
<33-15,BECKETT>而是一个装了假眼球的人
<33-15,BECKETT>He was looking for a one-eyed man.

988
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,510
<33-15,BECKETT>或者应该说  一个装了假眼球的女人
<33-15,BECKETT>Or in our case, a one-eyed woman.

989
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,090
<34-1,ANGELICA>除非律师在场  否则我不会说半个字
<34-1,ANGELICA>I'm not saying a word without my lawyer.

990
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,990
<34-2,CASTLE>你不用说话  听着就行
<34-2,CASTLE>You don't have to, but you might want to listen.

991
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,420
<34-3,BECKETT>我们知道了温德尔偷了什么
<34-3,BECKETT>We know what Wendell stole.

992
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,820
<34-4,ANGELICA>我受够了  我要叫律师
<34-4,ANGELICA>That's it. I'm calling my attorney.

993
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,320
<34-5,CASTLE>能让我来吗
<34-5,CASTLE>Uh, may I?

994
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,620
<34-8,BECKETT>-好吧  -谢谢
<34-8,BECKETT>- Yes. - Thank you.

995
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,310
<34-9,CASTLE>我协助过很多谋杀案
<34-9,CASTLE>I've worked a lot of murder cases,

996
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,180
<34-9,CASTLE>耐心地等待着
<34-9,CASTLE>waiting patiently for the day

997
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,120
<34-9,CASTLE>有一天能明确地高呼
<34-9,CASTLE>I could unequivocally exclaim,

998
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,350
<34-9,CASTLE>凶手就是管家
<34-9,CASTLE>The butler did it.

999
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,640
<34-10,KIRBY>什么
<34-10,KIRBY>What?

1000
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,210
<34-11,CASTLE>你肯定很震惊
<34-11,CASTLE>Must have been a shock--

1001
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,920
<34-11,CASTLE>这么多年过去了
<34-11,CASTLE>All these years later,

1002
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,210
<34-11,CASTLE>你终于能够摆脱一切
<34-11,CASTLE>after you put all that behind you,

1003
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,610
<34-11,CASTLE>可这个人突然出现
<34-11,CASTLE>to have someone walk into your life

1004
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,320
<34-11,CASTLE>又把你的生活全部打乱
<34-11,CASTLE>and stir it all back up again.

1005
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,670
<34-12,ANGELICA>科比
<34-12,ANGELICA>Kirby.

1006
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,080
<34-12,ANGELICA>他在说什么
<34-12,ANGELICA>What's he talking about?

1007
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,570
<34-13,BECKETT>你的管家交通肇事
<34-13,BECKETT>Your live-in butler caused a car accident

1008
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,250
<34-13,BECKETT>还逃离现场
<34-13,BECKETT>and then fled the scene.

1009
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,400
<34-13,BECKETT>两人因他的逃逸而丧命
<34-13,BECKETT>Because he did, two people lost their lives.

1010
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,760
<34-13,BECKETT>而这两人就是温德尔的父母
<34-13,BECKETT>And those people were Wendell's parents.

1011
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,240
<34-14,KIRBY>这简直
<34-14,KIRBY>That is...

1012
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,230
<34-14,KIRBY>荒谬至极
<34-14,KIRBY>absolutely ridiculous.

1013
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,210
<34-14,KIRBY>你根本没有证据
<34-14,KIRBY>You can't prove any of it.

1014
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,600
<34-15,BECKETT>温德尔偷走的假眼上有你的DNA
<34-15,BECKETT>Your D.N.A. was on the prosthetic eye that Wendell stole.

1015
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,940
<34-15,BECKETT>与在温蒂旅馆房间
<34-15,BECKETT>And it's a match to the D.N.A.

1016
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,570
<34-15,BECKETT>发现的弹壳上的DNA相吻合
<34-15,BECKETT>found on the shell casing in Wendy's hotel room.

1017
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,310
<34-16,CASTLE>都结束了
<34-16,CASTLE>It's all over.

1018
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,060
<34-17,KIRBY>我那么努力
<34-17,KIRBY>I worked...

1019
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,720
<34-17,KIRBY>想要忘记那个晚上
<34-17,KIRBY>so hard to put that night--

1020
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,490
<34-17,KIRBY>那个可怕的晚上
<34-17,KIRBY>that horrible night-- behind me.

1021
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,930
<34-18,CASTLE>而那次入室盗窃
<34-18,CASTLE>And then the break-in.

1022
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,700
<34-19,KIRBY>有那么多东西可以偷
<34-19,KIRBY>Of all the things to steal,

1023
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,200
<34-19,KIRBY>却偏偏拿走了我抽屉里的备用假眼
<34-19,KIRBY>my spare eye from off my bureau.

1024
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,750
<34-19,KIRBY>那时我才弄明白
<34-19,KIRBY>That's when I put it all together--

1025
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,450
<34-19,KIRBY>那个新来司机真正的身份
<34-19,KIRBY>who the new chauffer truly was

1026
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,390
<34-19,KIRBY>以及他想要证明的事情
<34-19,KIRBY>and what he was trying to prove.

1027
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,910
<34-19,KIRBY>但你  你们也得理解
<34-19,KIRBY>But you-- you have to understand...

1028
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,360
<34-19,KIRBY>我无法使他们的父母起死回生
<34-19,KIRBY>I couldn't bring their parents back.

1029
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,600
<34-19,KIRBY>这不可能
<34-19,KIRBY>I-I couldn't.

1030
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,430
<34-19,KIRBY>我为什么要遭这个罪
<34-19,KIRBY>Why should I suffer?

1031
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,470
<34-20,BECKETT>科比·史密斯  你因谋杀
<34-20,BECKETT>Kirby Smith, you're under arrest

1032
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,110
<34-20,BECKETT>温德尔和温蒂·杜普利
<34-20,BECKETT>for the murders of Wendell

1033
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,630
<34-20,BECKETT>而被捕
<34-20,BECKETT>and Wendy Dupree.

1034
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:25,200
<34-20,BECKETT>我相信宾夕法尼亚州政府
<34-20,BECKETT>And I am sure that the state of Pennsylvania

1035
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,940
<34-20,BECKETT>一定还会再为你加上两条
<34-20,BECKETT>will be adding two counts

1036
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,200
<34-20,BECKETT>驾车过失杀人罪
<34-20,BECKETT>of vehicular manslaughter to that.

1037
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,080
<35-1,BECKETT>科比对其罪行供认不讳
<35-1,BECKETT>Kirby made a full confession.

1038
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,330
<35-1,BECKETT>他曾读到一篇关于近期一起
<35-1,BECKETT>He read an article about a recent mugging

1039
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,440
<35-1,BECKETT>地铁站抢劫案件的文章
<35-1,BECKETT>in the subway station,

1040
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,970
<35-1,BECKETT>决定在那里杀了温德尔
<35-1,BECKETT>and decided to kill Wendell there.

1041
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,120
<35-1,BECKETT>因为他知道那里的摄像头坏了
<35-1,BECKETT>Because he knew that the cameras wouldn't be working.

1042
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,100
<35-2,CASTLE>但温德尔偷走的证据依然存在
<35-2,CASTLE>But the evidence that Wendell stole

1043
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,490
<35-2,CASTLE>他的妹妹温蒂也同样知情
<35-2,CASTLE>was still out there, so was his sister Wendy.

1044
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,320
<35-2,CASTLE>当她去往仓库
<35-2,CASTLE>When she started poking around storage spaces,

1045
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,350
<35-2,CASTLE>科比跟踪她回旅馆并枪杀了她
<35-2,CASTLE>Kirby tracked her to the hotel and shot her.

1046
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,420
<35-3,GATES>卑鄙的混蛋
<35-3,GATES>Worthless bastard.

1047
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,960
<35-4,CASTLE>你说什么
<35-4,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

1048
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,680
<35-5,GATES>他毁了他们全家
<35-5,GATES>He took out their whole family.

1049
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,830
<35-6,GATES>干得好  探长
<35-6,GATES>Good job, detective.

1050
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,020
<35-7,BECKETT>谢谢
<35-7,BECKETT>Thank you.

1051
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,840
<35-8,CASTLE>现在...她又讨厌我了
<35-8,CASTLE>And... she hates me again.

1052
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,340
<35-9,BECKETT>是啊  看来那些娃娃对她十分重要
<35-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, those gemini dolls obviously meant a lot to her.

1053
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,650
<35-10,CASTLE>我好奇背后的故事
<35-10,CASTLE>Yeah, I wonder what that story is.

1054
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,160
<35-11,BECKETT>我好奇背后的所有故事
<35-11,BECKETT>I wonder what those stories are.

1055
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,170
<35-11,BECKETT>那堆东西你打算怎么处理  卡塞尔
<35-11,BECKETT>What are you gonna do with all of that stuff, Castle?

1056
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,440
<35-12,CASTLE>我打算把登山装备送给哈维尔
<35-12,CASTLE>Well, I'll give the climbing equipment to Javier,

1057
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,580
<35-12,CASTLE>另外的嘛
<35-12,CASTLE>and then, uh,

1058
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,510
<35-12,CASTLE>我想我会都捐了吧
<35-12,CASTLE>donate the rest, I guess.

1059
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,400
<35-12,CASTLE>它们已经完成了使命  为他们家伸张了正义
<35-12,CASTLE>It served its purpose. Brought justice to his family.

1060
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,800
<35-12,CASTLE>但同样也说明每个人
<35-12,CASTLE>But it just goes to show you that everyone

1061
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,170
<35-12,CASTLE>每件东西背后都有一个故事
<35-12,CASTLE>and everything has a story,

1062
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,280
<35-12,CASTLE>包括你的小人
<35-12,CASTLE>Including your little stick man there.

1063
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,240
<35-12,CASTLE>那么
<35-12,CASTLE>So...

1064
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,780
<35-13,BECKETT>你还要再试试吗
<35-13,BECKETT>You want to take another shot?

1065
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,800
<35-14,CASTLE>不了
<35-14,CASTLE>Actually, no.

1066
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,950
<35-14,CASTLE>我仔细想了想你的话
<35-14,CASTLE>I thought about what you said.

1067
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,490
<35-14,CASTLE>你说的没错
<35-14,CASTLE>And you're right.

1068
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,560
<35-14,CASTLE>就算我们已经...
<35-14,CASTLE>Just because we've been...
