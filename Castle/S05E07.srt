118
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,300
<5-7,JOEL>也不会想看这部电影

119
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,830
<5-7,JOEL>除非我把电影改成惊悚片之类的
<5-7,JOEL>So unless I can reinvent it as some kind of thriller,

153
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,050

<7-1,BUTTERFLY>trying to meet him.

162
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
<7-5,BUTTERFLY>我昏睡过去了
<7-5,BUTTERFLY>I passed out.

<7-9,BUTTERFLY>我听到了马的声音
<7-9,BUTTERFLY>I heard a horse.

172
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,530
<7-10,CASTLE>马嘶声吗
<7-10,CASTLE>A horse as in whinnying?

173
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,230
<7-10,CASTLE>不是

174
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,430
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>我听到了马蹄声
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>I heard the sound of horse hooves

175
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,940
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>在雪地里咯吱作响
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>Crunching in the snow.

176
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,590
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>像是  咯吱  咯吱  咯吱
<7-11,BUTTERFLY>Like, crunch, crunch, crunch--

177
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,440
<7-12,BECKETT>好  能不能只讲你昏睡过去前
<7-12,BECKETT>Okay, can we, uh, just focus on what happened

178
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
<7-12,BECKETT>发生的事
<7-12,BECKETT>just before you passed out?

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,730
<7-12,BECKETT>他看上去有什么心事吗
<7-12,BECKETT>Did he seem like he was upset?

180
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,380
<7-12,BECKETT>他有没有像是和人争吵过
<7-12,BECKETT>Did he seem like he had been fighting with anyone?

181
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,700
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>实际上正相反
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>Actually, the opposite.

182
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,130
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>他最近常在抱怨
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>He'd been complaining a lot

183
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,100
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>乐队其他几个人的事
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>about the other guys in the band recently,

184
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,820
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>他们会有争论  关系紧张
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>you know, the--the arguments and the tension.

185
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,390
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>可昨晚
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>but last night,

186
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,910
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>他好像很开心
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>he--he seemed happy, you know?

187
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,450
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>就像找到了某种安宁
<7-13,BUTTERFLY>Like--like he'd found some kind of peace.

188
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,940
<8-1,BECKETT>我不知道那姑娘会不会有足够的力气
<8-1,BECKETT>I don't know if that girl could swing a guitar

189
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,220
<8-1,BECKETT>挥起吉他杀人
<8-1,BECKETT>with enough force to kill anyone,

190
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,260
<8-1,BECKETT>可我还是得检查她的衣物寻找血渍
<8-1,BECKETT>but I still gotta check her clothes for blood spatter.

191
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,840
<8-2,CASTLE>我对那些乐队成员的争端
<8-2,CASTLE>I'm more interested in what the band members

192
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
<8-2,CASTLE>更感兴趣
<8-2,CASTLE>were fighting about.

193
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,780
<8-3,BECKETT>你们在干什么

<8-3,BECKETT>你们无权来这里
<8-3,BECKETT>You have no right to be here.

196
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,840
<8-4,JOEL>实际上  你说错了
<8-4,JOEL>Uh, actually, that's not true.

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,480
<8-4,JOEL>抱歉  探长  但我也束手无策
<8-4,JOEL>I'm sorry, detective, but it's out of my hands.

198
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,950
<8-4,JOEL>市政厅认为这样有助公关
<8-4,JOEL>City hall has decided it's good P.R.

199
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,730
<9-1,VICTORIA GATES>等等  那案子呢

200
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,870

<9-2,BECKETT>They're gonna compromise the investig--

201

202
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,410
<9-3,GATES>可他们已经做了决定
<9-3,GATES>but a decision has been made,

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,250
<9-3,GATES>我希望你能照做
<9-3,GATES>and I expect you to comply with it.

221
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,200
<10-2,BECKETT>而只因为他们想侵犯我的隐私
<10-2,BECKETT>And just because they want to invade my privacy,

222
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,530
<10-2,BECKETT>不代表我就得推波助澜
<10-2,BECKETT>it doesn't mean that I have to help them do it.

223
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,180
<10-3,CASTLE>好吧  或许吧

<10-3,CASTLE>可这些摄像头要缠着我们了
<10-3,CASTLE>But... these cameras, they're not going anywhere.

225
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,500
<10-3,CASTLE>他们会拍到些东西
<10-3,CASTLE>They're gonna see something.

<10-3,CASTLE>我只想让他们看到我看到的
<10-3,CASTLE>I just want them to see what I see.

<11-1,KEITH>等等  为什么需要我们的不在场证明
<11-1,KEITH>Hold on. Why do you need our alibis?

228
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,130
<11-2,BECKETT>因为我们了解到斯旺先生和乐队的关系
<11-2,BECKETT>Because we understand that there was some tension

229
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,930
<11-2,BECKETT>有点紧张
<11-2,BECKETT>between Mr. Swan and the band.

230
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,830
<11-2,BECKETT>关系紧张多正常啊
<11-2,BECKETT>Of course there was tension.

231
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,970
<11-3,KEITH>我们朝夕相处  总会有点摩擦
<11-3,KEITH>You spend every second together, it's not always gonna be pretty.

232
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,450
<11-4,ZEKE>我们组团五年了
<11-4,ZEKE>We've been together for five years.

233
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,500
<11-4,ZEKE>如果你知道想在这行做得好
<11-4,ZEKE>Like, if you had any idea the kind of crap

234
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,700
<11-4,ZEKE>都要承受些什么压力...
<11-4,ZEKE>that you go through trying to make it in this business...

235
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,520
<11-4,ZEKE>这种压力会让人很团结
<11-4,ZEKE>It has a way of bonding people.

236
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,250
<11-5,CASTLE>要不就使他们非常非常厌恶彼此
<11-5,CASTLE>Or making them really, really sick of each other.

237
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,910
<11-6,KEITH>我们很照顾詹姆斯
<11-6,KEITH>Hey, we looked out for James.

238
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,420
<11-6,KEITH>他是来自俄亥俄州的中产阶级孩子
<11-6,KEITH>He was a middle-class kid from Ohio.

239
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,560
<11-6,KEITH>他根本不了解这种生活
<11-6,KEITH>He didn't know what the hell he was getting into with this life.

240
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,470
<11-7,BECKETT>我们还是需要关于你们
<11-7,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, we're still gonna need statements

241
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,520
<11-7,BECKETT>昨晚去向的口供
<11-7,BECKETT>about where you were last night.

242
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,570
<11-8,KEITH>好吧  我在我的拖车里
<11-8,KEITH>Fine. I was in my trailer.

243
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,490
<11-8,KEITH>-表演结束我就去了  -我也是
<11-8,KEITH>- I went there right after the show. - Me, too.

244
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,740
<11-9,ZEKE>我们都在自己的拖车里
<11-9,ZEKE>We were all in our trailers.

245
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,770
<11-10,BILLY>我们有记录显示
<11-10,BILLY>All right, well, we have reports

246
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,430
<11-11,BECKETT>那一带有辆白色面包车
<11-11,BECKETT>that there was a white van in the area.

247
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,130
<11-11,BECKETT>詹姆斯有没有提到过
<11-11,BECKETT>Did James ever mention anything about that?

248
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,260
<11-12,ZEKE>没
<11-12,ZEKE>No.

249
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,980
<11-13,BILLY>不过他确实认为有人跟踪他
<11-13,BILLY>But he did think someone was following him.

250
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,630
<11-14,KEITH>对  一个月前
<11-14,KEITH>Yeah, uh, it was a month ago.

251
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,840
<11-14,KEITH>就在我们去伊萨卡的那段时间
<11-14,KEITH>Right around the time we played Ithaca.

252
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,390
<11-14,KEITH>他疑神疑鬼的
<11-14,KEITH>He w--he was acting all paranoid.

253
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,960
<11-14,KEITH>他说要多雇些保安
<11-14,KEITH>He was talking about hiring extra security.

254
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,340
<11-15,BECKETT>他说他怕谁了吗
<11-15,BECKETT>Did he say who he was afraid of?

255
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,910
<11-16,KEITH>没  可他最近没提这事了
<11-16,KEITH>No, but, um, he hadn't brought it up recently,

256
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,390
<11-16,KEITH>所以我以为一切回归正常了
<11-16,KEITH>so I just assumed everything was normal

257
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,140
<11-16,KEITH>-直到他昨晚闹了那一出  -对
<11-16,KEITH>- until he pulled that stunt yesterday. - Yeah.

258
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,160
<11-18,CASTLE>昨天怎么了
<11-18,CASTLE>What happened yesterday?

259
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,070
<11-19,ZEKE>他没参加我们一点的乐队会议
<11-19,ZEKE>He blew off our 1:00 band meeting.

260
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,320
<11-19,ZEKE>我们六点校音时才见到他
<11-19,ZEKE>We didn't see him again until sound check at 6:00.

261
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
<11-20,BILLY>他从没缺席过乐队会议
<11-20,BILLY>The guy never missed a band meeting.

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
<11-21,BECKETT>他说去哪里了吗
<11-21,BECKETT>Did he say where he was going?

263
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,390
<11-22,KEITH>没说
<11-22,KEITH>No.

264
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,750
<11-23,ZEKE>不过我知道
<11-23,ZEKE>But I do know this,

265
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,700
<11-23,ZEKE>一直追拍他的摄像师
<11-23,ZEKE>the camera guy that was following him

266
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,720
<11-23,ZEKE>说詹姆斯故意把他甩开了
<11-23,ZEKE>said that James ditched him on purpose.

267
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,010
<11-24,CASTLE>所以不管他在做什么  都不想让人知道
<11-24,CASTLE>So whatever he was doing, he didn't want anyone to know.

268
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,930
<11-25,ESPOSITO>喂  你们有时间吗
<11-25,ESPOSITO>Yo. You guys got a sec?

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,250
<12-2,JAMES>他们是自学的吉他
<12-2,JAMES>they, uh, they learned to play guitar themselves.

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,330
<12-2,JAMES>但我有个导师
<12-2,JAMES>But I had a mentor.

275
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,330

304
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,000
<13-1,RYAN>我们把白色货车的图片放大
<13-1,RYAN>So we blew up the picture of the white van

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,530
<13-1,RYAN>直到能看得清牌照
<13-1,RYAN>wide enough to get a license plate.

306
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,640
<13-1,RYAN>它的注册地址就在这附近
<13-1,RYAN>It's registered to an address somewhere around here.

<13-3,RYAN>不  我要走另一条路
<13-3,RYAN>No, I'm going another way.

309
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,280
<13-4,ESPOSITO>你什么意思  只有一条路
<13-4,ESPOSITO>What do you mean? There's only one way.

310
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,470
<13-5,RYAN>不  还有一条路  在后面有条路
<13-5,RYAN>No, there's a different way. There's a back way.

311
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,110
<13-6,ESPOSITO>后面才没有路呢
<13-6,ESPOSITO>There's no back way.

312

<13-7,RYAN>相信我  相信我
<13-7,RYAN>Trust me. Trust me.

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,580
<13-8,RYAN>请不要误会
<13-8,RYAN>I-I know how this might look,

314
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,370
<13-8,RYAN>我们其实是很不错的搭档
<13-8,RYAN>but we actually make a pretty good team

315
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,420
<13-8,RYAN>我们各有不同的特长
<13-8,RYAN>because we each have, uh, different strengths.

316
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,290
<13-8,RYAN>没错
<13-8,RYAN>That's true.

317
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,510
<13-9,ESPOSITO>比如  我以前是军人
<13-9,ESPOSITO>For example, I'm former military,

318
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,430
<13-9,ESPOSITO>所以我是个神枪手
<13-9,ESPOSITO>which makes me an expert marksman.

319
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,840
<13-9,ESPOSITO>我通常是第一个破门而入的
<13-9,ESPOSITO>I'm usually first through the door.

320
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,630
<13-10,RYAN>是啊  但总得有人知道该冲向哪扇门
<13-10,RYAN>Well, yeah, but somebody's gotta know which door to go through.

321
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,920
<13-10,RYAN>而我则比我的搭档  要细心慎重得多
<13-10,RYAN>I'm a little bit more, um, circumspect, uh, than my partner here.

322
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,910
<13-11,RYAN>我就像是团队的神经中枢
<13-11,RYAN>I'm kinda like the--the nerve center of the team.

323
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,560
<13-12,ESPOSITO>而我则是身强体壮的那位
<13-12,ESPOSITO>But I'm definitely the physical one.

324
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,700
<13-12,ESPOSITO>我身体一直很棒
<13-12,ESPOSITO>I stay in sick shape.

325
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,430
<13-12,ESPOSITO>瞧瞧  见过这么健壮的二头肌吗
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Boom. Have you been to the gun show?

326
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,370
<13-12,ESPOSITO>我开玩笑的
<13-12,ESPOSITO>I'm just kidding.

327
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,160
<13-12,ESPOSITO>我只是  说真的  我身体很棒
<13-12,ESPOSITO>I'm just--seriously, though, I'm in sick shape.

328
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,860
<13-13,RYAN>老兄  你这衬衫是怎么回事
<13-13,RYAN>Dude, what's with the shirt?

329
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,340
<13-13,RYAN>很紧啊  你换衣服了吗
<13-13,RYAN>It's really tight. Did you change it?

330
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,500
<13-14,ESPOSITO>我  洒了些东西在上面
<13-14,ESPOSITO>I... I spilled something on it.

331

<13-15,RYAN>到了
<13-15,RYAN>Ah, here it is.

332
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,590
<13-16,ESPOSITO>缓慢接近
<13-16,ESPOSITO>Slow approach.

333
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,610
<13-17,RYAN>跟紧点
<13-17,RYAN>Stay close.

334
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,400
<13-18,ESPOSITO>我觉得他看到我们了
<13-18,ESPOSITO>I think he saw us.

335

<13-21,RYAN>瞧瞧我们找到了什么
<13-21,RYAN>What do we have here?

338
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,420
<13-21,RYAN>我很确定那不是番茄酱
<13-21,RYAN>Pretty sure that ain't ketchup.

339
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,890
<14-1,BECKETT>那就是我们要找的跟踪狂吗
<14-1,BECKETT>Hey, is that our stalker?

340
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,400
<14-2,ESPOSITO>前跟踪狂
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Ex-stalker.

341
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
<14-2,ESPOSITO>他很快就将过上不见天日的生活了
<14-2,ESPOSITO>He won't be seeing daylight any time soon.

342
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,890

343
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,970
<14-4,ESPOSITO>你去观察室旁观吧  我来攻破他
<14-4,ESPOSITO>You should watch from observation while I tear this guy apart.

344
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,820
<14-5,BECKETT>他有什么可疑之处吗
<14-5,BECKETT>So, uh, we like this guy?

345
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,680
<14-6,RYAN>我们在他的车上发现血滴
<14-6,RYAN>We found bloodstained overalls in his van.

346
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
<14-6,RYAN>已经送去化验室
<14-6,RYAN>We sent 'em to be tested

347
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,320
<14-6,RYAN>看看是否和被害人的血样吻合
<14-6,RYAN>to see if they match the blood from our vic.

348
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,700
<14-7,ESPOSITO>肯定吻合  相信我  老兄
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, they match. Trust me, bro.

349
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,900
<14-7,ESPOSITO>你们不用再担心这个变态
<14-7,ESPOSITO>You won't have to worry about this creep

350
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,300
<14-7,ESPOSITO>再出去伤害别人了
<14-7,ESPOSITO>hurting anyone ever again.

351
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,960
<14-7,ESPOSITO>那是我送给你的礼物
<14-7,ESPOSITO>That's a gift from me to you.

352
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,790
<14-7,ESPOSITO>别客气  祖国母亲
<14-7,ESPOSITO>You're welcome, America.

353
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,370
<15-3,CASTLE>我错过什么了吗
<15-3,CASTLE>I miss anything?

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,520
<15-4,BECKETT>没有  他们才刚开始
<15-4,BECKETT>No. They're just getting started.

355
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,770
<15-5,CASTLE>绳子  汽油
<15-5,CASTLE>Rope,gasoline.

356
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,440
<15-6,ESPOSITO>你对詹姆斯·斯旺心存歹心
<15-6,ESPOSITO>You wanted to do nasty things to James Swan.

357
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,680
<15-7,JOE SILVA>我不知道你在说些什么
<15-7,JOE SILVA>I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,040
<15-8,ESPOSITO>我觉得你清楚得很
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, I think you do.

359
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,630
<15-8,ESPOSITO>我给你一点时间
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna give you a second...

360
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,140
<15-8,ESPOSITO>把情况理清楚
<15-8,ESPOSITO>to get your facts straight.

361
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,900
<15-9,CASTLE>哇  限定时间  真是经典手段
<15-9,CASTLE>Ooh, the time-out. That's a classic.

362
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,250
<15-9,CASTLE>审讯  其实也是一种艺术
<15-9,CASTLE>Interrogation, it's really an art form.

363
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,770
<15-9,CASTLE>比如  贝克特探长  就是一位大师
<15-9,CASTLE>I mean, detective Beckett here, she is a master.

364
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,780
<15-9,CASTLE>我见过她在这间小屋子里破获无数起案件
<15-9,CASTLE>I have watched her crack countless cases in this very room.

365
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,750
<15-9,CASTLE>你记得那个杀害自己园丁的男人吗
<15-9,CASTLE>You remember that guy who killed his gardener

366
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,420
<15-9,CASTLE>就因为他把玫瑰剪得太短
<15-9,CASTLE>because he cut his roses too short?

367
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
<15-11,RYAN>我们找到了你的工作裤
<15-11,RYAN>Found your overalls.

368
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,690
<15-11,RYAN>上面都是斯旺的血
<15-11,RYAN>They had Swan's blood all over 'em.

369
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,780
<15-12,JOE>那不是他的血  是我自己的血
<15-12,JOE>It's not his blood. It's my blood.

370
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,950
<15-12,JOE>我在车上弄东西时  不小心割伤了
<15-12,JOE>I cut myself when I was working on my van.

371
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,400
<15-13,ESPOSITO>别瞎编了  乔  你以为我们蠢吗
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Oh, come on, Joe. What, do you think we're stupid?

372
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,030
<15-13,ESPOSITO>我们有录像证明你跟踪他好几周
<15-13,ESPOSITO>We've got you on video following him for weeks.

373
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,740
<15-13,ESPOSITO>我们发现你的车出现在案发现场
<15-13,ESPOSITO>We've got your van at the crime scene.

374
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,860
<15-13,ESPOSITO>你就别再装清白了好吗
<15-13,ESPOSITO>So why don't you cut the innocent crapright now!

375
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,880
<15-14,JOE>你想让我承认吗  那我就承认吧
<15-14,JOE>You want me to admit it? I admit it.

376
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,820
<15-14,JOE>我是跟踪他  我承认
<15-14,JOE>I followed him. I did.

377
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,750
<15-14,JOE>我只是打算抓住他
<15-14,JOE>I was just planning to grab him.

378
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,790
<15-15,ESPOSITO>但是你的计划出了差池
<15-15,ESPOSITO>And that's when your plan went sideways.

379
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,030
<15-15,ESPOSITO>你想将他拖到你的车上
<15-15,ESPOSITO>you tried to drag him to your van,

380
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,980
<15-15,ESPOSITO>但是他不愿意
<15-15,ESPOSITO>but he didn't want to go.

381
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,090
<15-16,JOE>不是那样的
<15-16,JOE>That's not how it happened.

382
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,750
<15-17,ESPOSITO>-然后你怒火中烧  -不是那样的
<15-17,ESPOSITO>- And that's when you got mad-- - That's not how it happened!

383
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,850
<15-17,ESPOSITO>然后你怒火中烧
<15-17,ESPOSITO>That's when you got mad

384
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,920
<15-19,ESPOSITO>然后你敲碎了他的脑袋
<15-19,ESPOSITO>And that's when you busted his head open.

385
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,430
<15-20,JOE>我没有杀人
<15-20,JOE>I didn't kill anybody.

386
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,820
<15-20,JOE>我只是
<15-20,JOE>I just...

387
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,030
<15-20,JOE>我只是
<15-20,JOE>I just...

388
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,810
<15-20,JOE>我只是想找回我闺女
<15-20,JOE>I just want my little girl.

389
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,360
<15-21,RYAN>你闺女
<15-21,RYAN>Your little girl?

390
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,490
<15-21,RYAN>我女儿
<15-21,RYAN>My daughter.

391
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,080
<15-22,JOE>她辞了工作  成了粉丝
<15-22,JOE>She quit her job to become a groupie.

392
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,600
<15-22,JOE>完全抛弃了人生
<15-22,JOE>Threw her whole life away.

393
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,800
<15-22,JOE>我很担心她被搞大肚子
<15-22,JOE>I was afraid she was gonna get pregnant...

394
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,040
<15-22,JOE>或者更糟
<15-22,JOE>Or worse.

395
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,160
<15-22,JOE>我只想抓住他
<15-22,JOE>All I wanted to do was grab him.

396
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,490
<15-22,JOE>我想吓唬吓唬他
<15-22,JOE>I wanted to scare him a little.

397
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,340
<15-22,JOE>我想让他离她远一点
<15-22,JOE>I wanted him to stay away from her.

398
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,430
<15-23,ESPOSITO>你女儿
<15-23,ESPOSITO>Your daughter?

399
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,590
<15-23,ESPOSITO>是的
<15-23,ESPOSITO>Yes.

400
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,450
<15-24,JOE>我已经好几周没见过她了
<15-24,JOE>I haven't seen her in weeks.

401
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,450
<15-24,JOE>我都不知道她是否还活着
<15-24,JOE>I don't even know if she's alive.

402
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,730
<15-25,RYAN>她的名字是不是叫小蝴蝶
<15-25,RYAN>Does she go by the name of Butterfly?

403
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,720
<15-26,JOE>是的
<15-26,JOE>Yes.

404
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,160
<15-27,RYAN>我觉得我们可以帮你找到她
<15-27,RYAN>I think we can help you find her,

405
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,370
<15-27,RYAN>如果我的搭档没意见的话
<15-27,RYAN>If it's okay with my partner.

406
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,060
<16-1,RYAN>似乎那个跟踪狂说的是实话
<16-1,RYAN>Well, looks like our stalker was telling the truth.

407
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,160
<16-1,RYAN>初步化验结果表明工装裤上的血是他自己的
<16-1,RYAN>Prelim shows that the blood on his overalls was his.

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,380
<16-1,RYAN>我很遗憾  搭档
<16-1,RYAN>Sorry, partner.

409
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,340
<16-2,ESPOSITO>至少抓住那家伙也不算是彻头彻尾的失败
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Well, at least grabbing the guy up wasn't a total bust.

410
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,020
<16-3,RYAN>我可不觉得  似乎就是彻头彻尾的失败嘛
<16-3,RYAN>I don't know. It seems to be the definition of a total bust.

411
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,770
<16-4,ESPOSITO>如果我刚刚没在拘留室继续问话  那确实如此
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Well, it would've been if hadn't just spoken to him in holding.

412
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,060
<16-4,ESPOSITO>既然他一直尾随着被害人
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Seeing as how he was tailing our victim,

413
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,550
<16-4,ESPOSITO>他很清楚斯旺被害那天下午去了哪里
<16-4,ESPOSITO>He knew exactly where Swan Was on the afternoon of his death.

414
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,910
<16-5,BECKETT>很好  哪里
<16-5,BECKETT>Great. Where?

415
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,510
<16-6,ESPOSITO>他先是去了苏豪区的一家银行  然后去了
<16-6,ESPOSITO>He was at a bank in soho and then he went into

416
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,300
<16-6,ESPOSITO>拉斐特街和布鲁姆街交汇路口的一幢居民楼
<16-6,ESPOSITO>a residential building on the corner of Lafayette and Broome.

417
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,760
<16-7,CASTLE>去那里做什么
<16-7,CASTLE>Yes, but why?

418
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,960
<16-7,CASTLE>斯旺甩掉了摄影师  自己悄悄地去办事
<16-7,CASTLE>Swan eluded his cameraman to go on a clandestine errand,

419
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,350
<16-7,CASTLE>此事如此重要  以至于他缺席了乐队会议
<16-7,CASTLE>an errand so important, he missed a band meeting.

420
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,940
<16-7,CASTLE>他的行程并不规律  在那之前去了趟银行
<16-7,CASTLE>He was acting erratically, went to the bank right beforehand.

421
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,360
<16-7,CASTLE>这些线索都指向一件事
<16-7,CASTLE>This all points to one thing.

422
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,460
<16-8,RYAN>-毒品  -毒品
<16-8,RYAN>- Drugs. - Dr-drugs.

423
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,980
<16-9,CASTLE>推论挺有意思  但这完全是猜测
<16-9,CASTLE>That's an interesting theory, but that is pure speculation.

424
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,060
<16-10,BECKETT>其实不然
<16-10,BECKETT>Actually, it's not.

425
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,530
<16-11,CASTLE>要让我猜测的话  我会说斯旺购买了
<16-11,CASTLE>Pure speculation would be Swan purchasing

426
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,740
<16-11,CASTLE>热核技术产品
<16-11,CASTLE>thermonuclear technology

427
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,290
<16-11,CASTLE>让科学家给他做个扩音器
<16-11,CASTLE>to have a scientist make him an amplifier

428
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,070
<16-11,CASTLE>让12区都能听见他的声音
<16-11,CASTLE>that went all the way to 12.

429
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,220
<16-11,CASTLE>而这个
<16-11,CASTLE>This...

430
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,050
<16-11,CASTLE>音乐家买毒品
<16-11,CASTLE>Musicians buying drugs--

431
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,070
<16-11,CASTLE>那可真是家常便饭
<16-11,CASTLE>That's just Monday morning crossword.

432
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,800
<16-12,ESPOSITO>我去查查房客  看有没有可疑的
<16-12,ESPOSITO>I'll pull a list of tenants, see if anyone pops.

433
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,620
<16-13,BECKETT>蕾妮有东西要给我们看
<16-13,BECKETT>Lanie's got something she wants us to see.

434
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,270
<16-14,CASTLE>蕾妮  蕾妮是谁
<16-14,CASTLE>Lanie. Who's Lanie?

435
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,460
<16-15,BECKETT>蕾妮是我们的法医
<16-15,BECKETT>Uh, Lanie is our medical examiner.

436
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,390
<16-15,BECKETT>她在停尸房工作
<16-15,BECKETT>And she works at the morgue.

437
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,000
<16-15,BECKETT>她有线索要给我们看
<16-15,BECKETT>And she's got information that she wants us to see,

438
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,670
<16-15,BECKETT>而我们在让她干等着
<16-15,BECKETT>and we are keeping her waiting.

439
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,180
<16-17,CASTLE>-还是有点僵硬  -确实  她总是太严肃
<16-17,CASTLE>- Still a little stiff. - Certainly, she could tighten that up,

440
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,510
<16-17,CASTLE>不过已经好多了
<16-17,CASTLE>but she's getting better.

441
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,280
<17-1,LANIE>死者的血液测试报告出来了
<17-1,LANIE>The victim's blood panels came back.

442
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,410
<17-2,CASTLE>让我猜猜
<17-2,CASTLE>Let me guess.

443
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,560
<17-2,CASTLE>有毒品
<17-2,CASTLE>Drugs.

444
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,930
<17-3,LANIE>不  他可真是难得安分守己的摇滚明星
<17-3,LANIE>Nope. This was one clean-living rock star.

445
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,570
<17-3,LANIE>事实上  他体内有什么并不重要
<17-3,LANIE>In fact, it's not what he put in his body,

446
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,860
<17-3,LANIE>重要的是他缺的东西
<17-3,LANIE>it's what he didn't.

447
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,830
<17-3,LANIE>詹姆斯体内没有小儿麻痹症抗体
<17-3,LANIE>James had no antibodies for polio.

448
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,680
<17-4,BECKETT>他从没注射过小儿麻痹症疫苗吗
<17-4,BECKETT>He never had the polio vaccine?

449
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,990
<17-5,CASTLE>等一下  20世纪60年代后出生的人
<17-5,CASTLE>Wait. Everyone born since the early 1960s

450
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,890
<17-5,CASTLE>都打过那个疫苗
<17-5,CASTLE>got that vaccine.

451
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,760
<17-6,LANIE>我也在琢磨这事
<17-6,LANIE>That's what I thought.

452
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,370
<17-6,LANIE>他体内也没有破伤风疫苗  麻疹疫苗
<17-6,LANIE>He also had no antibodies for tetanus, measles,

453
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,380
<17-6,LANIE>百日咳疫苗  各种标准疫苗都没
<17-6,LANIE>whooping cough-- all standard immunizations.

454
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,120
<17-7,BECKETT>还有什么
<17-7,BECKETT>What else?

455
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,910
<17-8,LANIE>这还不够吗
<17-8,LANIE>Isn't that enough?

456
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,140
<17-9,BECKETT>蕾妮  你通常有这种线索时
<17-9,BECKETT>Lanie, usually if you have something like this for me,

457
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,180
<17-9,BECKETT>都只是用电话通知我
<17-9,BECKETT>you just call me over the phone.

458
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,890
<17-10,LANIE>我觉得你们该过来跑一趟
<17-10,LANIE>Well, I thought it was worth the trip.

459
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,310
<18-1,BECKETT>莱恩  查一下死者的医疗记录
<18-1,BECKETT>Ryan, can you look into our vic's medical records?

460
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,240
<18-1,BECKETT>我想知道他为何从没接种过疫苗
<18-1,BECKETT>I wanna find out why he was never vaccinated.

461
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,180
<18-2,RYAN>这就去
<18-2,RYAN>On it.

462
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,810
<18-3,ESPOSITO>我想我搞清楚
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Okay, I think I figured out

463
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,890
<18-3,ESPOSITO>詹姆斯·斯旺为什么去那幢楼了
<18-3,ESPOSITO>why James Swan went to that building.

464
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,670
<18-3,ESPOSITO>他有个熟人住那里  叫山姆·斯比尔
<18-3,ESPOSITO>He knew a guy who lived there-- a Sam Spear.

465
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,910
<18-3,ESPOSITO>那家伙在跟我们的死者打个大官司
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Dude has an outstanding lawsuit against our vic.

466
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,220
<18-4,BECKETT>什么官司
<18-4,BECKETT>What kind of a lawsuit?

467
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,490
<18-5,ESPOSITO>他告詹姆斯
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Well, he claims that James

468
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,820
<18-5,ESPOSITO>盗取了一首他给乐队写的歌的版权
<18-5,ESPOSITO>stole one of the band's songs from him,

469
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,040
<18-5,ESPOSITO>詹姆斯肯定是觉得理亏
<18-5,ESPOSITO>and James must have thought he had a case,

470
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,030
<18-5,ESPOSITO>因为他在见山姆之前去了银行
<18-5,ESPOSITO>because when he stopped at a bank on his way to see this guy,

471
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,820
<18-5,ESPOSITO>取走了两万五千美元的现金
<18-5,ESPOSITO>he took out 25 grand, cash.

472
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,390
<18-6,CASTLE>看来他是想庭外和解
<18-6,CASTLE>Sounds like he's trying to settle out of court.

473
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,020
<18-7,ESPOSITO>对  而且我猜他没有成功
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and I'm guessing it didn't pan out.

474
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,670
<18-7,ESPOSITO>山姆·斯比尔买了一张昨晚演出的门票
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Sam Spear bought a ticket to last night's show.

475
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,510
<18-8,CASTLE>也就是说在斯旺被害前他就在剧院
<18-8,CASTLE>So he was at the theater right before Swan was killed.

476
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,080
<18-9,ESPOSITO>该去找这人谈谈了
<18-9,ESPOSITO>Time to pay this guy a visit.

477
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,090
<18-10,ESPOSITO>不不不  这个我负责
<18-10,ESPOSITO>No. No, no, no. I got this.

478
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,890
<18-10,ESPOSITO>你就在这儿做你的小研究吧
<18-10,ESPOSITO>You stay here and work on your little research project,

479
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,520
<18-10,ESPOSITO>脑力活可都得靠你
<18-10,ESPOSITO>you being the nerve center and all.

480
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,790
<18-10,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<18-10,ESPOSITO>Castle.

481
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,630
<18-11,CASTLE>你去吧
<18-11,CASTLE>Uh, you coming?

482
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,220
<18-12,BECKETT>不了
<18-12,BECKETT>No, I'm good.

483
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,190
<18-13,CASTLE>等等我
<18-13,CASTLE>Wait up.

484
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,840
<19-1,ESPOSITO>不是这间
<19-1,ESPOSITO>It's not this one.

485
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,270
<19-1,ESPOSITO>斯比尔住在3M号房
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Spear's in 3-M.

486
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,450
<19-2,CASTLE>贝克特探长并不是个不友好的人
<19-2,CASTLE>You know, Detective Beckett is not an unfriendly person.

487
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,090
<19-2,CASTLE>她只是比较戒备
<19-2,CASTLE>She's just got walls.

488
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,040
<19-2,CASTLE>怎么说呢  就是她有许多层
<19-2,CASTLE>Let's-- let's call them layers.

489
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,610
<19-2,CASTLE>一层一层的戒备
<19-2,CASTLE>Layers upon layers of uh, well, walls.

490
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,750
<19-2,CASTLE>但一旦你打破了这些戒备
<19-2,CASTLE>But once you scale those walls...

491
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,400
<19-2,CASTLE>就会像雨过天晴一般
<19-2,CASTLE>the effort is worth it.

492
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,370
<19-3,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  请你小点声
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Castle. Keep your voice down, please.

493
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,760
<19-4,CASTLE>我今天已经拷过一个人了
<19-4,CASTLE>All right. I've already had one guy bolt on me today.

494
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,370
<19-5,ESPOSITO>关键是突然袭击  看  我也能很细心的
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Element of surprise is key. See, I can be circumspect.

495
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,060
<19-5,ESPOSITO>伙计们没我可不行
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Folks would be lost without me.

496
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,640
<19-6,CASTLE>他走错方向了
<19-6,CASTLE>He went the wrong way.

497
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,950
<19-6,CASTLE>是3M  斯比尔家
<19-6,CASTLE>It's 3-M. Spear's place.

498
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,980
<19-7,ESPOSITO>-放下武器  -准备好了吗
<19-7,ESPOSITO>- Drop your weapon! - You ready?

499
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,530
<19-8,ESPOSITO>快点把她放开
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Let her go right now...

500
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,400
<19-8,ESPOSITO>纽约警局  都不许动
<19-8,ESPOSITO>NYPD! Nobody moves!

501
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,760
<19-9,ESPOSITO>-举起双手  -好好
<19-9,ESPOSITO>- Get your hands up! - Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

502
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,800
<19-11,ESPOSITO>举起手来
<19-11,ESPOSITO>Let me see your hands!

503
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,220
<19-12,SAM>怎么回事
<19-12,SAM>What is this?

504
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,810
<19-12,SAM>放下武器
<19-12,SAM>Drop your weapon!

505
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,850
<19-13,SAM>一部烂片罢了
<19-13,SAM>It's just a bad movie.

506
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,000
<19-13,SAM>我在谱曲
<19-13,SAM>I'm just composing the score.

507
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,440
<19-14,SAM>这完全是个误会
<19-14,SAM>This is all a misunderstanding.

508
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,620
<19-15,ESPOSITO>我们来回顾一下
<19-15,ESPOSITO>Let's review--

509
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,030
<19-15,ESPOSITO>您告詹姆斯·斯旺偷了你一首歌
<19-15,ESPOSITO>You sued James Swan over a song,

510
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,940
<19-15,ESPOSITO>昨天他因此事来找过你
<19-15,ESPOSITO>and then he came to see you about it yesterday.

511
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,470
<19-15,ESPOSITO>几小时后  他在演出完毕后遇害
<19-15,ESPOSITO>A few hours later, he was killed right after his show.

512
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,060
<19-17,ESPOSITO>-什么  -而且你还去现场观看了演出
<19-17,ESPOSITO>- What? - A show that you attended.

513
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,480
<19-18,SAM>但我们都协商好了
<19-18,SAM>But we worked all that out.

514
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,060
<19-18,SAM>我  他会把那首歌一半的发行收益分给我
<19-18,SAM>I--he was gonna give me half the publishing for that song.

515
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,310
<19-18,SAM>一旦合同签订
<19-18,SAM>I was gonna drop the complaint

516
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,500
<19-18,SAM>我立马就会撤销诉讼了
<19-18,SAM>as soon as the papers were signed.

517
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,850
<19-19,ESPOSITO>那他给你的两万五千美金怎么解释
<19-19,ESPOSITO>That doesn't explain the 25 grand he brought to you.

518
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,970
<19-20,SAM>两万五  那可不关我的事
<19-20,SAM>25--I-I-I don't know anything about that.

519
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,170
<19-20,SAM>他希望我为他写歌
<19-20,SAM>Look, he wanted me to write for him.

520
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,330
<19-20,SAM>现在工作这么难找  杀死老板也太蠢了吧
<19-20,SAM>It'd be pretty stupid to kill off an employer in this job market.

521
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,840
<19-21,CASTLE>你在给他写歌
<19-21,CASTLE>You were writing songs for him?

522
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,210
<19-22,SAM>对  这里  看
<19-22,SAM>Uh, yeah. Here. Uh, look.

523
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,960
<19-22,SAM>我已经开始了
<19-22,SAM>I-I already started.

524
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,390
<19-22,SAM>这首都写了好多了
<19-22,SAM>I got pretty far on that one.

525
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,780
<19-22,SAM>我看看
<19-22,SAM>Let me see that.

526
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,820
<19-23,ESPOSITO>和声部分确实不错
<19-23,ESPOSITO>I do like the vocal line on this.

527
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,050
<19-24,CASTLE>你看的懂乐谱
<19-24,CASTLE>You read music?

528
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,600
<19-25,ESPOSITO>怎么  我是个警察  就不能会唱歌了吗
<19-25,ESPOSITO>What, you think, because I'm a cop, I can't sing?

529
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,230
<19-26,CASTLE>不  我认为你不会唱歌是因为我听过你唱歌
<19-26,CASTLE>No, I think you can't sing because I've heard you sing.

530
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,560
<19-27,ESPOSITO>那个卡拉OK机有问题
<19-27,ESPOSITO>That karaoke machine was busted.

531
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,290
<19-27,ESPOSITO>回头我唱给你听
<19-27,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna sing for y'all later.

532
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,560
<19-28,CASTLE>如果只是找人写歌
<19-28,CASTLE>If this was just about writing songs,

533
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
<19-28,CASTLE>为什么要这么神神秘秘
<19-28,CASTLE>why all the secrecy?

534
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,780
<19-29,SAM>他没说出口  但我猜测过
<19-29,SAM>He never said, but I had my theories,

535
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,100
<19-29,SAM>因为他乐队的新成员
<19-29,SAM>especially because this new stuff

536
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,010
<19-29,SAM>在音乐能力上与他差距太大
<19-29,SAM>was such a musical departure for him,

537
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,980
<19-30,ESPOSITO>我相信你们也注意到了
<19-30,ESPOSITO>as I'm sure you noticed.

538
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,330
<19-30,ESPOSITO>是啊  稍等一下
<19-30,ESPOSITO>Yeah--just one sec.

539
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,940
<19-31,CASTLE>他想改变音乐风格
<19-31,CASTLE>Taking the music in a new direction,

540
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,080
<19-31,CASTLE>但又不想乐队的其他人知道
<19-31,CASTLE>but he didn't want the rest of the band to know.

541
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,030
<19-31,CASTLE>就是这样
<19-31,CASTLE>Of course.

542
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,380
<19-32,ESPOSITO>斯旺准备单飞了
<19-32,ESPOSITO>Swan was going solo.

543
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,380
<19-32,ESPOSITO>这假设合理
<19-32,ESPOSITO>Makes sense.

544
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,240
<19-32,ESPOSITO>导演说斯旺是整个团队的
<19-32,ESPOSITO>The director said that Swan was the creative force

545
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,070
<19-32,ESPOSITO>创作来源
<19-32,ESPOSITO>behind the group,

546
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,110
<19-32,ESPOSITO>如果他要单飞  乐队就完蛋了
<19-32,ESPOSITO>That if he left the band, they would flounder.

547
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,540
<19-33,CASTLE>如果有一个队员发现了
<19-33,CASTLE>What if one of the other members found out

548
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,230
<19-33,CASTLE>当面和他对质呢
<19-33,CASTLE>and confronted him?

549
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,660
<19-34,ESPOSITO>他们争吵  事情越闹越糟糕
<19-34,ESPOSITO>And they argued, and things got ugly.

550
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,250
<19-35,CASTLE>没错  他无意继续留队
<19-35,CASTLE>Right. He wasn't about to stay.

552
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,010
<19-35,CASTLE>他们也不会让他像乔治·迈克尔那样
<19-35,CASTLE>And they weren't about to let him play George Michael

553
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,130
<19-35,CASTLE>离开安德鲁·维治利
<19-35,CASTLE>to their Andrew Ridgeley.

554
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,510
<19-36,ESPOSITO>-安德鲁谁  -没错
<19-36,ESPOSITO>- Andrew who? - Exactly.

555
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,230
<19-37,CASTLE>所以他们拿起一把吉他...
<19-37,CASTLE>So they pick up a guitar...

556
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
<19-37,CASTLE>然后  "威猛"
<19-37,CASTLE>And Wham!

557
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,240
<19-38,SAM>我就是干这个的
<19-38,SAM>It's what I do.

558
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,440
<19-39,CASTLE>不赖
<19-39,CASTLE>That's not bad.

559
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,390
<19-40,ESPOSITO>-很有表现力  -是
<19-40,ESPOSITO>- It gives it weight. - Yeah.

560
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,690
<20-1,BECKETT>找了新吉他手
<20-1,BECKETT>Got yourself a new guitarist.

561
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,210
<20-2,KEITH>换人试试呗
<20-2,KEITH>Trying someone out, yeah.

562
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,570
<20-3,CASTLE>速度挺快嘛
<20-3,CASTLE>Well, that was fast.

563
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,000
<20-3,CASTLE>不过我猜这次试演
<20-3,CASTLE>Though I guess you had this audition

564
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,290
<20-3,CASTLE>是你提前就安排好的吧
<20-3,CASTLE>lined up already, didn't you?

565
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,610
<20-4,KEITH>你说什么呢
<20-4,KEITH>What are you talking about?

566
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,870
<20-4,KEITH>得了吧  基斯
<20-4,KEITH>Come on, Keith.

567
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,730
<20-5,CASTLE>你早知道詹姆斯要单飞
<20-5,CASTLE>You knew James was going solo.

568
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,820
<20-6,ZEKE>是真的吗  哥们儿
<20-6,ZEKE>Is that true, man?

569
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,170
<20-7,KEITH>不  当然不是  我怎么会知道
<20-7,KEITH>No, of course not. How would I know that?

570
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,780
<20-8,BECKETT>我们在唱片公司遇到一个女孩
<20-8,BECKETT>We met with a woman from the record label.

571
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,880
<20-8,BECKETT>她说她是你的女朋友
<20-8,BECKETT>She says that she's your girlfriend.

572
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,430
<20-8,BECKETT>她说她曾和詹姆斯有过接触
<20-8,BECKETT>She said that she had a meeting on the books

573
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,560
<20-8,BECKETT>说他想要有所改变
<20-8,BECKETT>with James about making some changes

574
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,610
<20-8,BECKETT>同时还有传言说他要离开乐队
<20-8,BECKETT>and that there were rumors that he wanted to leave the band.

575
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,260
<20-9,CASTLE>那么多年  你们一起并肩努力
<20-9,CASTLE>All those years, struggling side by side.

576
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,460
<20-9,CASTLE>而今成功唾手可得
<20-9,CASTLE>And now success finally at hand,

577
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,260
<20-9,CASTLE>他却想独占所有的荣誉
<20-9,CASTLE>he wanted to take all the glory for himself.

578
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,880
<20-9,CASTLE>要是我  我也会发怒
<20-9,CASTLE>I know I'd be mad.

579
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,980
<20-10,KEITH>我不能就站在这儿  任你们污蔑我
<20-10,KEITH>I'm not gonna stand here and let you accuse me

580
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,030
<20-10,KEITH>杀害了我最好的朋友
<20-10,KEITH>of killing one of my best friends, all right?

581
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,160
<20-11,CASTLE>你听到那声音了吗
<20-11,CASTLE>You hear that sound?

582
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,330
<20-11,CASTLE>有点像马蹄踩踏在雪地里的嘎吱声
<20-11,CASTLE>Kind of like horse hooves crunching on snow?

583
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,320
<20-12,BECKETT>就像小蝴蝶在斯旺拖车上听到的声音
<20-12,BECKETT>Just like what Butterfly heard in Swan's trailer.

584
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,610
<21-1,BECKETT>听着  我们知道他心里窝火
<21-1,BECKETT>Look, we know he's got a temper,

585
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,190
<21-1,BECKETT>如果我们能够激怒他
<21-1,BECKETT>so if we can get him angry enough--

586
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,910
<21-2,CASTLE>事实上  你何不独自审问基斯呢
<21-2,CASTLE>Actually, why don't you talk to Keith yourself?

587
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,640
<21-3,BECKETT>为什么
<21-3,BECKETT>Why?

588
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,810
<21-4,CASTLE>因为我想给你点空间
<21-4,CASTLE>Because I want to give you room to operate

589
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,580
<21-4,CASTLE>好让你发挥
<21-4,CASTLE>and strut your stuff.

590
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,470
<21-4,CASTLE>妥妥的
<21-4,CASTLE>You got this.

591
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,650
<21-4,CASTLE>妥妥的
<21-4,CASTLE>She's got this.

592
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,780
<22-1,KEITH>不是吧  这你也得录下来吗
<22-1,KEITH>Really, you gotta film this, too?

593
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,490
<22-1,KEITH>他们想拍什么就拍什么  基斯
<22-1,KEITH>They can film whatever they want, Keith.

594
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,360
<22-2,BECKETT>是你自己签的字
<22-2,BECKETT>You signed a release.

595
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,080
<22-2,BECKETT>你杀詹姆斯·斯旺的时候摄像机没开着
<22-2,BECKETT>You're lucky the cameras weren't rolling

596
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,370
<22-2,BECKETT>就算你走运了
<22-2,BECKETT>when you killed James Swan.

597
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,110
<22-3,KEITH>听着  我已经说过了  我没杀他
<22-3,KEITH>Look, I already said, I didn't kill him.

598
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,200
<22-4,BECKETT>是啊  你还说过
<22-4,BECKETT>Yeah, and you also said

599
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,960
<22-4,BECKETT>你并不知道他要单飞
<22-4,BECKETT>that you didn't know that he was going solo

600
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,810
<22-4,BECKETT>演出结束后也没见过他
<22-4,BECKETT>and that you didn't see him after the show,

601
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,370
<22-4,BECKETT>但我有证人能证明你在案发当时
<22-4,BECKETT>But I have a witness that places you in his trailer

602
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,470
<22-4,BECKETT>就在他的拖车里
<22-4,BECKETT>at the time of death.

603
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,950
<22-5,KEITH>听着  我是去过他的拖车
<22-5,KEITH>All right, look, I did go to his trailer. Okay?

604
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,930
<22-5,KEITH>但也正如你说的
<22-5,KEITH>But it was like you said.

605
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,100
<22-5,KEITH>我听到了他要单飞的传言
<22-5,KEITH>I heard rumors that he was cutting out on us.

606
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,160
<22-5,KEITH>我去证实下是不是真的
<22-5,KEITH>I went to see if it was true.

607
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,000
<22-6,BECKETT>然后你失去了控制
<22-6,BECKETT>And then after that, you lost control.

608
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,180
<22-7,KEITH>不  我们只是谈了谈  行吗
<22-7,KEITH>No, we just talked. Okay?

609
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,990
<22-7,KEITH>而且詹姆斯否认了  他说他没有要离开
<22-7,KEITH>And James denied it. He said that he wasn't leaving.

610
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,370
<22-7,KEITH>他说他正在处理些事
<22-7,KEITH>He said he was working out something

611
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,420
<22-7,KEITH>对我们乐队有好处
<22-7,KEITH>that'd be good for all of us.

612
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,750
<22-8,BECKETT>他到底在处理什么事
<22-8,BECKETT>And what exactly was this something?

613
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,930
<22-9,KEITH>听着  我曾经一直以为我了解他
<22-9,KEITH>Look, I used to think I knew that dude,

614
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,610
<22-9,KEITH>但他自从伊萨卡回来后就不一样了
<22-9,KEITH>but he hasn't been the same since Ithaca.

615
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,620
<22-9,KEITH>我告诉你  那里一定发生过什么
<22-9,KEITH>I am telling you, something happened there.

616
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,520
<22-10,BECKETT>基斯  我没说伊萨卡
<22-10,BECKETT>Keith, I'm not talking about Ithaca.

617
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,370
<22-10,BECKETT>我说的是在拖车里到底发生了什么
<22-10,BECKETT>I am talking about what happened in that trailer.

618
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,790
<22-11,KEITH>我们聊了会  我走了
<22-11,KEITH>We talked. I left.

619
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,120
<22-11,KEITH>之后整晚我都待在我的拖车里
<22-11,KEITH>I went back to my trailer for the rest of the night.

620
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,410
<22-11,KEITH>我和一个姑娘在一起  你可以问她
<22-11,KEITH>I was with this girl. You can ask her.

621
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,190
<22-12,BECKETT>她叫什么名字
<22-12,BECKETT>What's her name?

622
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,270
<22-13,KEITH>我不记得
<22-13,KEITH>I don't remember her name.

623
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,870
<22-14,BECKETT>那电话号码呢
<22-14,BECKETT>A phone number then?

624
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,490
<22-14,BECKETT>任何我能找到她的东西
<22-14,BECKETT>Anything so I can get ahold of her?

625
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,500
<22-15,KEITH>她们都是主动上门
<22-15,KEITH>They come to me.

626
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,640
<22-16,BECKETT>基斯  你可得好好想清楚
<22-16,BECKETT>Keith, you're gonna have to do a lot better than that.

627
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,650
<22-17,KEITH>行  好吧
<22-17,KEITH>Okay. All right.

628
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,060
<22-17,KEITH>我不记得她的名字
<22-17,KEITH>I may not remember her name...

629
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,790
<22-17,KEITH>但我能证明我们那晚在一起
<22-17,KEITH>but I can prove that we were together that night.

630
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,330
<23-1,CASTLE>得  他俩真在一起
<23-1,CASTLE>Well, they were together, all right.

632
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,440
<23-2,ESPOSITO>汤米·李都比不上这家伙
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Tommy Lee's got nothing on this guy.

633
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,760
<23-3,GATES>我喜欢时不时地来跟进监督一下案子
<23-3,GATES>I like to check on the case every once in a while.

634
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,650
<23-3,GATES>当大家都在这里奋斗的时候
<23-3,GATES>No point in chaining myself to that desk

635
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,000
<23-3,GATES>我可完全没必要把自己栓在办公桌前
<23-3,GATES>when all the action is right out here.

636
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,270
<23-4,ESPOSITO>想要行动  看这里
<23-4,ESPOSITO>You want action, check this.

637
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,310
<23-4,ESPOSITO>喂喂喂  等等
<23-4,ESPOSITO>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

638
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,250
<23-5,GATES>这是不正当的办公室行为
<23-5,GATES>This is inappropriate workplace behavior.

639
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,780
<23-6,ESPOSITO>这是证据  长官
<23-6,ESPOSITO>This is evidence, sir.

640
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,790
<23-6,ESPOSITO>我们嫌疑人的不在场证明就靠它了
<23-6,ESPOSITO>Our suspect's alibi hinges on this.

641
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,250
<23-7,GATES>原来如此
<23-7,GATES>Oh. Oh.

642
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,030
<23-8,BECKETT>他的故事有结果了吗
<23-8,BECKETT>So does his story pan out?

643
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,220
<23-9,ESPOSITO>是  看来整个死亡时间区
<23-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, it seems like he's covered

644
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,710
<23-9,ESPOSITO>他都有不在场证明
<23-9,ESPOSITO>for the entire time-of-death window.

645
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,280
<23-10,GATES>但愿你没有轻信视频里的时间标记吧
<23-10,GATES>I hope you're not going on the time stamp on this video.

646
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,060
<23-10,GATES>知道吗  这个是可以伪造的
<23-10,GATES>That could be faked, you know?

647
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,380
<23-11,BECKETT>这不是视频里唯一伪造的东西
<23-11,BECKETT>That's not the only thing on this video being faked.

648
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,960
<23-12,ESPOSITO>背景里有电视在播放  长官
<23-12,ESPOSITO>Tv's on in the background, sir.

649
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,260
<23-12,ESPOSITO>而且播的是新闻  也就是说
<23-12,ESPOSITO>And that is the news, which means

650
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,190
<23-12,ESPOSITO>我可以用这个确认时间点
<23-12,ESPOSITO>I can verify the time stamp using that.

651
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,280
<23-12,ESPOSITO>很好
<23-12,ESPOSITO>Okay.

652
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,390
<23-13,GATES>干得好  各位
<23-13,GATES>Good job, everyone.

653
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,560
<23-13,GATES>继续努力
<23-13,GATES>Keep it up.

654
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,790
<23-14,CASTLE>不  这太简单了
<23-14,CASTLE>No. Too easy.

655
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,030
<23-15,BECKETT>看来我们又回到起点了
<23-15,BECKETT>So it looks like we're back to square one, huh?

656
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,940
<23-15,BECKETT>我可不会这么说
<23-15,BECKETT>Well, I wouldn't say that.

657
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,760
<23-16,RYAN>我去查了被害人的医疗记录
<23-16,RYAN>I was looking into our vic's medical records--

658
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,550
<23-16,RYAN>我的一点点小调查
<23-16,RYAN>my little, uh, research project.

659
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,990
<23-16,RYAN>结果发现  他没有记录
<23-16,RYAN>Turns out, he has no records.

660
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,710
<23-16,RYAN>出生登记  医疗记录  学生成绩  什么都没有
<23-16,RYAN>Birth, medical, student transcripts, nothing--

661
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,460
<23-16,RYAN>詹姆斯·斯旺第一次出现
<23-16,RYAN>The first time James Swan pops up

662
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,210
<23-16,RYAN>是在他17岁  在纽约伊萨卡的
<23-16,RYAN>is when he was 17 when he was hospitalized

663
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,050
<23-16,RYAN>一起车祸医疗记录
<23-16,RYAN>for a car accident in Ithaca, New York.

664
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,790
<23-17,CASTLE>为什么伊萨卡总是出现
<23-17,CASTLE>Why does Ithaca keep coming up?

665
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,860
<23-18,RYAN>因为他是那里人
<23-18,RYAN>Because that's where he's from.

666
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,060
<23-18,RYAN>我查过急症室登记的地址
<23-18,RYAN>I checked the address in the E.R. records.

667
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,070
<23-18,RYAN>追踪到一个占地20英亩的公社
<23-18,RYAN>Traced it to a 20-acre compound

668
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,250
<23-18,RYAN>是一家世俗教化教堂的资产
<23-18,RYAN>owned by the church of Worldly Enlightenment.

669
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,920
<23-19,CASTLE>各位  等一下
<23-19,CASTLE>Whoa, guys, wait a second.

670
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,130
<23-19,CASTLE>我听说过那地方  那是个邪教
<23-19,CASTLE>I've heard about this place. It's a cult.

671
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,840
<23-20,BECKETT>这就是为什么他没有接种任何疫苗
<23-20,BECKETT>That's why he doesn't have any vaccinations

672
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,260
<23-20,BECKETT>他也没有家的原因
<23-20,BECKETT>and that's why he doesn't have a family.

673
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,400
<23-20,BECKETT>他在邪教长大
<23-20,BECKETT>He grew up in a cult.

674
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,360
<23-21,RYAN>唯一离开的方式就是逃走
<23-21,RYAN>The only way to leave was to escape.

675
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,710
<23-21,RYAN>那个公社高墙伫立
<23-21,RYAN>The compound is walled

676
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,900
<23-21,RYAN>邪教教俗又得严格遵守
<23-21,RYAN>and the cult practices strict obedience.

677
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,750
<23-21,RYAN>每个人的手臂上都有"服侍"的纹身
<23-21,RYAN>Everyone tattoos the word "Serve" on their forearm.

678
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,310
<23-22,CASTLE>"服侍"
<23-22,CASTLE>"Serve."

679
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,210
<23-22,CASTLE>还记得詹姆斯的纹身吗
<23-22,CASTLE>Remember James' tattoo?

680
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,720
<23-22,CASTLE>"观察"
<23-22,CASTLE>"Observe"?

681
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,100
<23-22,CASTLE>他肯定是在他逃出来之后
<23-22,CASTLE>He must have added the "O" and the "B"

682
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,430
<23-22,CASTLE>又纹了O和B
<23-22,CASTLE>sometime after he got out.

683
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,690
<23-23,ESPOSITO>但当乐队在伊萨卡演出时  可能有人认出了他
<23-23,ESPOSITO>But when the band played Ithaca, maybe somebody recognized him.

684
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,520
<23-24,BECKETT>所以他担心
<23-24,BECKETT>Which is why he was afraid

685
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,730
<23-24,BECKETT>有人在跟踪他
<23-24,BECKETT>that someone was following him.

686
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,290
<23-25,RYAN>詹姆斯有理由担心
<23-25,RYAN>James had reason to be afraid.

687
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,380
<23-25,RYAN>约翰·坎贝尔是邪教领袖
<23-25,RYAN>John Campbell, the cult's leader.

688
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,040
<23-25,RYAN>这家伙完全是个变态  还有暴力前科
<23-25,RYAN>The guy is a total psycho with a violent past.

689
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,300
<23-25,RYAN>在开创邪教骗局之前
<23-25,RYAN>He did ten years for murder

690
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,450
<23-25,RYAN>他因谋杀罪坐了十年牢
<23-25,RYAN>before starting the whole church scam.

691
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,640
<23-26,BECKETT>知道坎贝尔现在在哪儿吗
<23-26,BECKETT>Do we know where Campbell is now?

692
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,170
<23-27,RYAN>我可以告诉你他去过哪里
<23-27,RYAN>Well, I can tell you where he was.

693
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,680
<23-27,RYAN>我查了旅客名单
<23-27,RYAN>I checked passenger manifests...

694
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,810
<23-28,ESPOSITO>给我看看
<23-28,ESPOSITO>Let me see that.

695
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,290
<23-29,RYAN>所有附近的机场
<23-29,RYAN>For all the nearby airports.

696
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,670
<23-29,RYAN>他两天前抵达肯尼迪机场
<23-29,RYAN>He flew into J.F.K. two days ago.

697
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,680
<23-30,ESPOSITO>是这样没错
<23-30,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

698
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,390
<23-31,CASTLE>等等  斯旺就是那天死的
<23-31,CASTLE>Wait a second. That's the day Swan died.

699
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,790
<23-31,CASTLE>就是说约翰·坎贝尔当时在城里
<23-31,CASTLE>So John Campbell was in town

700
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,310
<23-31,CASTLE>有好几天可以消磨[杀]
<23-31,CASTLE>with a few days to kill.

701
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,440
<23-31,CASTLE>发现双关没
<23-31,CASTLE>See what I did there?

702
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,880
<23-31,CASTLE>很棒  留下那段
<23-31,CASTLE>That was good. Use that.

703
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
<23-31,CASTLE>别留下我说的那句"发现双关没"
<23-31,CASTLE>Don't use the part where I said, "See what I did there?"

704
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,300
<23-31,CASTLE>这句剪掉  画面渐黑
<23-31,CASTLE>Cut that out. Do a hard fade to black.

705
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,330
<23-31,CASTLE>来段音乐
<23-31,CASTLE>Musical sting.

706
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,300
<24-1,GATES>找到坎贝尔了吗
<24-1,GATES>Hey. Are we close on locating Campbell?

707
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,790
<24-2,RYAN>他的照片已经发到全市所有的巡逻车了
<24-2,RYAN>Well, his picture is out to all patrol cars citywide.

708
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,470
<24-2,RYAN>我还把他的照片发给了数据库所有的酒店
<24-2,RYAN>And I've sent his photograph to all the hotels in our database.

709
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,360
<24-3,ESPOSITO>但问题是  他用化名
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but the trouble is, he uses aliases

710
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,060
<24-3,ESPOSITO>以避开缉毒局的侦查
<24-3,ESPOSITO>in order to stay off the D.E.A.'s radar.

711
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,550
<24-4,GATES>缉毒局为什么对他感兴趣
<24-4,GATES>Well, why's the D.E.A. interested?

712
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,030
<24-4,GATES>他的邪教
<24-4,GATES>The church of worldly enlightenment

713
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,240
<24-5,RYAN>不只是"友好"的邻家邪教
<24-5,RYAN>isn't just your friendly neighborhood cult.

714
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,650
<24-5,RYAN>它还是一个20英亩的大麻农场
<24-5,RYAN>It's also a 20-acre pot farm,

715
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,050
<24-5,RYAN>由300多人打理
<24-5,RYAN>run by the 300-plus members,

716
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,210
<24-5,RYAN>坎贝尔一人获利
<24-5,RYAN>all for Campbell's personal profit.

717
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,570
<24-6,GATES>联调局怎么没把他们端了
<24-6,GATES>Why don't the feds shut him down?

718
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,520
<24-7,RYAN>他们试过
<24-7,RYAN>They've tried.

719
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,690
<24-7,RYAN>但是因为宗教自由的原因
<24-7,RYAN>Something about freedom of religious expression.

720
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,230
<24-8,GATES>还有什么邪教的信息
<24-8,GATES>Can we get anything else on the cult

721
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,050
<24-8,GATES>能帮我们找到他的
<24-8,GATES>that can help us find him?

722
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,600
<24-9,ESPOSITO>贝克特探长正在追查这条线  长官
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Detective Beckett's working an angle right now, sir.

723
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:37,880
<25-1,ESPOSITO>有发现吗
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Any luck?

724
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,700
<25-2,BECKETT>有  我刚跟"邪教观察"通了电话
<25-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I just got off the phone with cultwatch,

725
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,920
<25-2,BECKETT>他们会帮我们联系一个
<25-2,BECKETT>and they're gonna hook us up with someone else

726
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,480
<25-2,BECKETT>从坎贝尔的桎梏下逃脱的人
<25-2,BECKETT>who escaped Campbell's compound.

727
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,100
<26-1,CAROLINE>我当时还小
<26-1,CAROLINE>I was a kid,

728
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,960
<26-1,CAROLINE>漂泊无依
<26-1,CAROLINE>drifting.

729
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,090
<26-1,CAROLINE>坎贝尔给我希望
<26-1,CAROLINE>Campbell promised me meaning,

730
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,220
<26-1,CAROLINE>给了我某种精神寄托
<26-1,CAROLINE>a spiritual focus.

731
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,850
<26-1,CAROLINE>作为回报  他夺走了一切
<26-1,CAROLINE>But in return, he took away everything.

732
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,570
<26-2,BECKETT>卡洛琳你有没有对这些镜头感到不适
<26-2,BECKETT>Uh, Caroline, are you worried about these cameras,

733
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,120
<26-2,BECKETT>如果你想撤走的话
<26-2,BECKETT>'cause if you want to have them gone--

734
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,910
<26-2,BECKETT>不不
<26-2,BECKETT>No. Mnh-mnh.

735
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,770
<26-3,CAROLINE>我想让世人知道他是怎样的一个禽兽
<26-3,CAROLINE>I want the world to know what a monster this man is.

736
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,220
<26-4,BECKETT>詹姆斯·斯旺逃走之后  坎贝尔有什么反应
<26-4,BECKETT>How did Campbell react when James Swan escaped?

737
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,780
<26-5,CAROLINE>他很愤怒
<26-5,CAROLINE>Oh, he was furious.

738
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,330
<26-5,CAROLINE>他原本很爱詹姆斯的
<26-5,CAROLINE>He used to love James.

739
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,340
<26-5,CAROLINE>所以他走之后背叛感特别强烈
<26-5,CAROLINE>That's why it was such a betrayal when he left.

740
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,590
<26-5,CAROLINE>我听说坎贝尔发誓要报复
<26-5,CAROLINE>I heard Campbell swear he'd get revenge,

741
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,400
<26-5,CAROLINE>不管需要多久
<26-5,CAROLINE>no matter how long it took.

742
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,080
<26-6,RYAN>伙计们  我有些线索
<26-6,RYAN>Hey, guys, I think I got something.

743
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
<26-6,RYAN>韦德马克酒店经理说
<26-6,RYAN>The manager of the Widmark Hotel

744
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,870
<26-6,RYAN>坎贝尔于两天前登记入住
<26-6,RYAN>said that Campbell checked in two days ago.

745
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,660
<26-7,BECKETT>巡逻车派过去了没
<26-7,BECKETT>Did you send a patrol car?

746
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,080
<26-8,RYAN>第二天早上他结账退房了
<26-8,RYAN>He checked out the next morning.

747
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,180
<26-8,RYAN>猜猜谁在他入住后就去见他了
<26-8,RYAN>But guess who came to visit him soon after he arrived there.

748
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,460
<26-8,RYAN>詹姆斯·斯旺
<26-8,RYAN>James Swan.

749
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,190
<26-9,BECKETT>什么时候
<26-9,BECKETT>When?

750
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,210
<26-10,RYAN>下午五点  斯旺被杀当晚
<26-10,RYAN>5:00 P.M. The same night that Swan was killed.

751
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,670
<26-11,CAROLINE>他杀了詹姆斯  我就知道
<26-11,CAROLINE>He killed James. I knew it.

752
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,050
<26-12,BECKETT>詹姆斯在躲坎贝尔
<26-12,BECKETT>James was running from Campbell.

753
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,940
<26-12,BECKETT>为什么他还答应碰面
<26-12,BECKETT>Why would he agree to meet with him?

754
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,260
<26-13,CAROLINE>为了换取自由
<26-13,CAROLINE>To buy his freedom.

755
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,450
<26-14,CASTLE>我来猜猜  用两万五美元
<26-14,CASTLE>Let me guess. For $25,000?

756
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,420
<26-15,CAROLINE>就是这样
<26-15,CAROLINE>That's right.

757
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,450
<26-16,BECKETT>你知不知道我们去哪能找到坎贝尔
<26-16,BECKETT>Do you have any idea where we could find Campbell now?

758
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,690
<26-16,BECKETT>如果他在城里
<26-16,BECKETT>If he is in town,

759
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,150
<26-17,CAROLINE>就可能在这个青旅
<26-17,CAROLINE>he might be at this youth hostel.

760
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,130
<26-17,CAROLINE>他在那里招新
<26-17,CAROLINE>He recruits there.

761
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,570
<26-17,CAROLINE>我就是在那里第一次见到他的
<26-17,CAROLINE>That's where I first met him.

762
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,190
<26-18,BECKETT>好的  我们去会会他
<26-18,BECKETT>All right. Let's go get him.

763
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,120
<27-1,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>不好意思  你们在干吗  摄影机是干什么用的
<27-1,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>Excuse me. What are you doing? What are these cameras for?

764
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,180
<27-2,BECKETT>我们在找约翰·坎贝尔
<27-2,BECKETT>We're looking for John Campbell.

765
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,670
<27-3,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>不好意思  没有
<27-3,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>Um... No, sorry.

766
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,250
<27-3,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>这里没人叫这个名字
<27-3,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>There's no one here by that name.

767
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,910
<27-4,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>不好意思  那是私人房间
<27-4,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>Uh, excuse me. That's a private room.

768
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,430
<27-4,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>你不能进去  不好意思
<27-4,HOSTEL ATTENDANT>And you can't go back there. Excuse me.

769
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,770
<27-5,BECKETT>坎贝尔先生
<27-5,BECKETT>Mr. Campbell.

770
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,030
<27-5,BECKETT>关于詹姆斯·斯旺  我们有几个问题
<27-5,BECKETT>We have a few questions about James Swan.

771
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,600
<27-5,BECKETT>坎贝尔先生  午夜到凌晨两点你在哪里
<27-5,BECKETT>Mr. Campbell, where were you between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

772
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,920
<28-1,BECKETT>詹姆斯·斯旺被杀的当晚
<28-1,BECKETT>The night that James Swan was killed?

773
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,010
<28-2,JOHN CAMPBELL>我在酒店客房
<28-2,JOHN CAMPBELL>I was in my hotel room.

774
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,370
<28-3,BECKETT>有谁可以担保的吗
<28-3,BECKETT>Can anyone vouch for that?

775
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,810
<28-4,CAMPBELL>我那时正在冥想
<28-4,CAMPBELL>Well, I was meditating.

776
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,270
<28-4,CAMPBELL>独处是晚间仪式的一个重要部分
<28-4,CAMPBELL>Solitude's a very important part of my evening ritual.

777
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,930
<28-5,CASTLE>那就是没有
<28-5,CASTLE>So that'd be a no.

778
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,930
<28-6,BECKETT>那你来城里做什么
<28-6,BECKETT>So what are you doing in town?

779
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,650
<28-7,CAMPBELL>打理教派
<28-7,CAMPBELL>Working for my church.

780
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,130
<28-7,CAMPBELL>募集资金  主要是招新
<28-7,CAMPBELL>Fund-raising, recruiting mostly.

781
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,380
<28-7,CAMPBELL>"募集资金"
<28-7,CAMPBELL>"Fund-raising"?

782
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,290
<28-8,CASTLE>让詹姆斯·斯旺买自由
<28-8,CASTLE>Interesting term for making James Swan

783
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,510
<28-8,CASTLE>好意思用这么高端的词汇
<28-8,CASTLE>pay you for his freedom.

784
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,900
<28-9,CAMPBELL>我和詹姆斯见过面  这不是秘密
<28-9,CAMPBELL>It's no secret that James and I had met.

785
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,990
<28-9,CAMPBELL>但他并不需要买自由
<28-9,CAMPBELL>But he certainly didn't need to buy his freedom.

786
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,840
<28-9,CAMPBELL>我们都是自由人
<28-9,CAMPBELL>We're all free.

787
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,120
<28-10,BECKETT>坎贝尔先生  我们知道詹姆斯拿着两万五现金
<28-10,BECKETT>Mr. Campbell, we know that James had 25 grand in cash

788
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,780
<28-10,BECKETT>去见你
<28-10,BECKETT>with him when he went to see you,

789
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,500
<28-10,BECKETT>离开的时候钱就不在他身上了
<28-10,BECKETT>and that he no longer had that money once he left.

790
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,470
<28-11,CAMPBELL>詹姆斯可能是给教派捐钱
<28-11,CAMPBELL>James may have made a donation to the church,

791
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,580
<28-11,CAMPBELL>但我不会讨论那些事
<28-11,CAMPBELL>but I make it a point not to discuss those matters.

792
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:21,320
<28-12,BECKETT>那我们来谈一谈伊萨卡的事吧
<28-12,BECKETT>Okay, so then why don't we discuss Ithaca?

793
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,900
<28-13,BECKETT>大概一个月前  詹姆斯和他的乐队在那办了音乐会
<28-13,BECKETT>About a month ago, James and his band had a concert there.

794
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,480
<28-13,BECKETT>后来他说他担心
<28-13,BECKETT>And he said that afterwards, he was concerned

795
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,790
<28-13,BECKETT>有人跟踪他
<28-13,BECKETT>that someone was coming after him.

796
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,790
<28-13,BECKETT>我觉得那个人就是你
<28-13,BECKETT>Now I think that that someone was you.

797
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,920
<28-14,CAMPBELL>不好意思  不过我不知道詹姆斯上个月在城里
<28-14,CAMPBELL>I'm sorry, but I had no idea James was in town last month.

798
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,830
<28-15,BECKETT>我觉得这不准确
<28-15,BECKETT>I don't think that's accurate.

799
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,730
<28-15,BECKETT>我觉得是他跟你的教派一刀两断
<28-15,BECKETT>I think that you're upset with him for cutting the cord

800
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,600
<28-15,BECKETT>让你很不爽
<28-15,BECKETT>with your church,

801
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,340
<28-15,BECKETT>-然后你就开始跟踪他  -不是那样的
<28-15,BECKETT>- and so you started tracking him. - That's not true.

802
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,280
<28-17,BECKETT>他给你捐了钱  所以你就放过他了
<28-17,BECKETT>He gave you a donation so that you would leave him alone.

803
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,090
<28-16,CAMPBELL>不是那样的
<28-16,CAMPBELL>That's not true.

804
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,230
<28-19,BECKETT>但是还不够  对不对  你要报复
<28-19,BECKETT>But that wasn't enough, was it? You wanted revenge.

805
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,470
<28-21,BECKETT>-不  -你跟着他到了拖车里
<28-21,BECKETT>- No. - So you followed him to his trailer...

806
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,150
<28-22,CAMPBELL>够了
<28-22,CAMPBELL>Enough.

807
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,900
<28-21,BECKETT>然后你怒不可遏  杀了他
<28-21,BECKETT>And then you killed him in a fit of rage!

808
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
<28-22,CAMPBELL>够了
<28-22,CAMPBELL>Enough!

809
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,760
<28-23,CAMPBELL>如果你们有证据
<28-23,CAMPBELL>Now if you have a solid case here,

810
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,240
<28-23,CAMPBELL>就逮捕我
<28-23,CAMPBELL>then arrest me.

811
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,140
<28-23,CAMPBELL>不然  谈话到此为止
<28-23,CAMPBELL>Otherwise, we're done.

812
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,330
<28-23,CAMPBELL>你们要是再联系我
<28-23,CAMPBELL>You contact me again,

813
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,120
<28-23,CAMPBELL>我就告你们宗教迫害
<28-23,CAMPBELL>and I will sue you for religious persecution.

814
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,890
<29-1,BECKETT>长官  我们可以确定是坎贝尔做的
<29-1,BECKETT>Sir, we're sure it was Campbell.

815
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,690
<29-1,BECKETT>他有杀人动机
<29-1,BECKETT>He had motive,

816
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,570
<29-1,BECKETT>死者遇害当天他们还见过面
<29-1,BECKETT>and he met with our victim the day that he died.

817
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,850
<29-2,CASTLE>伊萨卡的事他也满口谎言
<29-2,CASTLE>And he was lying through his teeth about Ithaca.

818
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,510
<29-2,CASTLE>斯旺就是在那儿被他发现的
<29-2,CASTLE>That's where Swan got on his radar.

819
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,660
<29-3,GATES>你们能证明吗
<29-3,GATES>Do you have any proof of that?

820
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,480
<29-4,BECKETT>暂时不能
<29-4,BECKETT>No, not yet,

821
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
<29-4,BECKETT>我们在查乐队在伊萨卡期间的
<29-4,BECKETT>but we're checking public records and police reports

822
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,170
<29-4,BECKETT>公共记录和警方报告
<29-4,BECKETT>from when the band was in Ithaca

823
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:28,900
<29-4,BECKETT>看能不能跟坎贝尔联系起来
<29-4,BECKETT>to see if there's a link to Campbell.

824
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,730
<29-5,GATES>我相信缉毒局肯定希望
<29-5,GATES>Well, I'm sure the D.E.A. will be delighted

825
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,960
<29-5,GATES>你们能查到一些...
<29-5,GATES>if you could help get some infor--

826
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,330
<29-6,BECKETT>-不好意思  -嗯
<29-6,BECKETT>- Excuse me. - Yeah.

827
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,900
<29-7,GATES>我是盖茨
<29-7,GATES>Gates.

828
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,250
<29-7,GATES>不不  DVD就行了
<29-7,GATES>No, no, no. DVDs will be fine.

829
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,670
<29-8,GATES>非常感谢  米塔斯先生
<29-8,GATES>Well, I appreciate it, Mr. Mitas.

830
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,910
<29-8,GATES>好的
<29-8,GATES>Okay.

831
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:50,770
<29-8,GATES>是我们的导演
<29-8,GATES>Our film director.

832
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,870
<29-8,GATES>你们也知道  这个片子一定要
<29-8,GATES>As you know, it's important that this project

833
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,020
<29-8,GATES>表现分局的正面形象
<29-8,GATES>reflects well on the precinct...

834
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,200
<29-8,GATES>我相信一定会是这样
<29-8,GATES>As I'm sure it will.

835
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,560
<29-8,GATES>但刚刚我们几个警探确实在看性爱录像带
<29-8,GATES>But we did have a number of officers watching a sex tape earlier.

836
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,620
<29-8,GATES>但是
<29-8,GATES>Still...

837
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,990
<29-8,GATES>为确保我的手下
<29-8,GATES>to ensure that the conduct of my people

838
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,810
<29-8,GATES>尽可能符合最高标准
<29-8,GATES>meets the highest possible standard,

839
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,160
<29-8,GATES>米塔斯先生会把分局的带子都拿给我看
<29-8,GATES>Mr. Mitas is sending over all the precinct footage for my review.

840
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,960
<29-9,BECKETT>全部吗  长官
<29-9,BECKETT>All of the footage, sir?

841
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,370
<29-10,GATES>有问题吗  探长
<29-10,GATES>Is there a problem, detective?

842
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,170
<29-11,BECKETT>当然没有
<29-11,BECKETT>Yeah, no, no. Of course not.

843
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,370
<29-11,BECKETT>那就好
<29-11,BECKETT>Okay.

844
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,870
<30-1,ESPOSITO>她确认了
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Well, she confirmed it.

845
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,260
<30-2,RYAN>这就是最后一块拼图了
<30-2,RYAN>Well, that's the missing piece.

846
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,880
<30-2,RYAN>去告诉贝克特吧
<30-2,RYAN>You should tell Beckett.

847
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,740
<30-3,ESPOSITO>除非你想去
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Unless you want to.

848
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,780
<30-3,ESPOSITO>这个嘛
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Well...

849
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,760
<30-4,RYAN>不了  是你查到的
<30-4,RYAN>Uh, no, no. You-- you brought it home.

850
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,910
<30-5,ESPOSITO>但是整个邪教的事都是你查出来的
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Nah, but you were the one who uncovered the whole cult thing.

851
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,140
<30-5,ESPOSITO>是不是  是他让整个案子豁然开朗了
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Right? I mean, this guy broke the whole case wide open.

852
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,800
<30-6,RYAN>对  但是是他
<30-6,RYAN>Yeah, but this guy was the guy

853
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,220
<30-6,RYAN>-查到了两万五的事  -对  但是
<30-6,RYAN>- who came up with the 25 grand, right? - Yeah, but--

854
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,610
<30-8,CASTLE>喂  怒虎狂龙[讲一对警探的电影]
<30-8,CASTLE>Hey, Tango and Cash.

855
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,260
<30-9,BECKETT>你们到底有没有事要告诉我们
<30-9,BECKETT>Is there something you guys want to tell us or not?

856
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,590
<30-10,ESPOSITO>-你想来...  -不  你说吧
<30-10,ESPOSITO>- Do you wanna... - Nah, go ahead.

857

<30-11,RYAN>好吧
<30-11,RYAN>All right.

858
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,640
<30-12,ESPOSITO>我们在查死者在伊萨卡那晚的
<30-12,ESPOSITO>Well, we were going over police records

859
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,000
<30-12,ESPOSITO>警方报告
<30-12,ESPOSITO>for the night that our vic was in Ithaca,

860
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,040
<30-12,ESPOSITO>我们找到了别的东西
<30-12,ESPOSITO>but we found something else.

861
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,510
<30-13,RYAN>约翰·坎贝尔报告了一起失踪人口
<30-13,RYAN>A missing persons report was filed by John Campbell

862
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,600
<30-13,RYAN>就在乐队离开的第二天
<30-13,RYAN>the day after the band left town.

863
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,160
<30-14,BECKETT>邪教有人失踪了
<30-14,BECKETT>Someone went missing from the cult?

864
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,730
<30-15,RYAN>对  一个叫巴克·库珀的人
<30-15,RYAN>Yeah, a guy named Buck Cooper.

865
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,260
<30-15,RYAN>我们跟"邪教观察"的联系人卡洛琳进行了核实
<30-15,RYAN>We checked with Caroline our Cultwatch contact.

866
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
<30-15,RYAN>发现巴克是斯旺当年在邪教时
<30-15,RYAN>It turns out that Buck was Swan's best friend

867
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,750
<30-15,RYAN>最好的朋友
<30-15,RYAN>from his days back in the cult.

868
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,580
<30-15,RYAN>这才是在伊萨卡发生的事
<30-15,RYAN>So that's what happened in--in Ithaca.

869
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:24,190
<30-16,CASTLE>斯旺回公社是为解救朋友
<30-16,CASTLE>I mean, Swan went back to the compound to break out his friend.

870
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,810
<30-16,CASTLE>这才是坎贝尔去找他的真正原因
<30-16,CASTLE>That's the real reason Campbell went after him.

871
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,150
<30-17,BECKETT>那两万五不是给斯旺赎身
<30-17,BECKETT>So the 25 grand wasn't for Swan's freedom.

872
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,470
<30-17,BECKETT>而是给他的朋友
<30-17,BECKETT>It was for his friend's.

873
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,580
<30-17,BECKETT>他的证词能帮我们逮捕坎贝尔
<30-17,BECKETT>This guy's testimony could help us nail Campbell.

874
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,320
<30-18,ESPOSITO>我们一直在找他  但系统里没有他的资料
<30-18,ESPOSITO>We've been looking for him, but he's not in the system.

875
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,910
<30-18,ESPOSITO>但卡洛琳要给我们发张照片
<30-18,ESPOSITO>But Caroline was supposed to send over a photo.

876
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,010
<30-18,ESPOSITO>在这儿
<30-18,ESPOSITO>There it is.

877
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,990
<30-19,ESPOSITO>瞧啊  我们认识他
<30-19,ESPOSITO>Boom. Check it out. We know that guy.

878
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,930
<30-20,RYAN>是我在犯罪现场跟他说过话的管理员
<30-20,RYAN>It's the roadie I talked to at the crime scene.

879
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,240
<30-21,CASTLE>扳倒坎贝尔的关键
<30-21,CASTLE>Well, the key to taking down Campbell

880
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,050
<30-21,CASTLE>一直在我们眼皮底下
<30-21,CASTLE>has been under our nose the whole time.

881
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,590
<31-1,BUCK>我知道我早就该出来说点什么
<31-1,BUCK>I know I should've said something earlier,

882
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,460
<31-1,BUCK>只是  詹姆斯让我小心行事
<31-1,BUCK>it's just, James told me to keep my head down,

883
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,430
<31-1,BUCK>然后他突然就死了
<31-1,BUCK>and then all of a sudden, he was dead.

884
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,710
<31-1,BUCK>我不知道该如何是好
<31-1,BUCK>And I didn't know what to do.

885
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,630
<31-2,BECKETT>没事  巴克  你安全了
<31-2,BECKETT>It's okay, Buck. You're safe now.

886
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,890
<31-3,BUCK>我欠他一条命
<31-3,BUCK>I owe that man my life,

887
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,140
<31-3,BUCK>现在我再也没机会报答他了
<31-3,BUCK>and now I'm never gonna get a chance to repay him.

888
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,930
<31-4,BECKETT>其实  你或许有这个机会
<31-4,BECKETT>Actually, you-- you might be able to.

889
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,970
<31-4,BECKETT>你可以帮我们给坎贝尔定杀害詹姆斯的罪
<31-4,BECKETT>You could help us nail Campbell for his death.

890
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,890
<31-4,BECKETT>我真希望如此
<31-4,BECKETT>I wish I could, ma'am.

891
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,690
<31-5,BUCK>天晓得那个人罪行累累
<31-5,BUCK>Lord knows, that man's done some terrible things.

892
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,510
<31-5,BUCK>问题是  他没有杀詹姆斯
<31-5,BUCK>The trouble is, killing James isn't one of 'em.

893
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,230
<31-6,BUCK>坎贝尔收下詹姆斯的钱时
<31-6,BUCK>When Campbell took the money from James,

894
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,600
<31-6,BUCK>他保证不会再来找我们麻烦
<31-6,BUCK>he promised not to bother us anymore.

895
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,230
<31-6,BUCK>我一定要听他亲口说
<31-6,BUCK>I needed to hear that myself.

896
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,470
<31-6,BUCK>我得看着他的眼睛
<31-6,BUCK>I needed to look him in the eyes.

897
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,820
<31-7,CASTLE>詹姆斯被杀时你跟坎贝尔在一起
<31-7,CASTLE>You were with Campbell when James was killed.

898
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,550
<31-8,BECKETT>那么杀詹姆斯的不可能是坎贝尔
<31-8,BECKETT>So then Campbell couldn't have killed James.

899
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,860
<31-8,BECKETT>那是谁呢
<31-8,BECKETT>But then who did?

900
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,660
<31-9,BUCK>真希望我知道
<31-9,BUCK>I wish I knew.

901
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,240
<31-10,BECKETT>你在他拖车里的时候他对你说什么了吗
<31-10,BECKETT>Did he say anything to you when you were in his trailer?

902
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,250
<31-11,BUCK>他说他要给我我应得的
<31-11,BUCK>He said that he was ready to make things right for me.

903
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,200
<31-12,CASTLE>这话什么意思
<31-12,CASTLE>Uh... Make things right?

904
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,840
<31-12,CASTLE>他不是已经做到了吗
<31-12,CASTLE>Didn't he already do that?

905
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,140
<31-13,BUCK>我也这么想
<31-13,BUCK>Yeah, I thought so.

906
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,510
<31-13,BUCK>詹姆斯帮我脱离邪教
<31-13,BUCK>James got me out of the cult.

907
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,240
<31-13,BUCK>帮我脱离坎贝尔的魔爪
<31-13,BUCK>James got me away from Campbell.

908
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,400
<31-13,BUCK>他还在乐队给我找了个工作
<31-13,BUCK>He even gave me a job in his band.

909
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,580
<31-13,BUCK>而我为他做过的  只是教他弹吉他
<31-13,BUCK>All I ever did for the guy was teach him how to play guitar.

910
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,780
<31-14,CASTLE>你是他的老师
<31-14,CASTLE>You were his teacher?

911
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,500
<31-14,CASTLE>大部分人会说
<31-14,CASTLE>Most guys will tell you

912
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,000
<32-1,JAMES>他们是自学的吉他
<32-1,JAMES>they learned to play guitar themselves,

913
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,820
<32-1,JAMES>但我有个导师
<32-1,JAMES>but I had a mentor, and...

914
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,410
<32-1,JAMES>他十分了不起
<32-1,JAMES>and the guy was incredible.

915
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,170
<32-1,JAMES>我永远达不到他的高度
<32-1,JAMES>You--much better than I'll ever be.

916
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,650
<32-2,INTERVIEWER>他怎么看乐队的
<32-2,INTERVIEWER>What's he think of the band?

917
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,890
<32-2,INTERVIEWER>我们很久没联络了
<32-2,INTERVIEWER>You know, we lost touch a ways back.

918
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,810
<32-3,JAMES>而我
<32-3,JAMES>And, uh...

919
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,590
<32-3,JAMES>有时候会想他现在怎么样了
<32-3,JAMES>Sometimes I wonder what he's up to.

920
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,270
<32-4,CASTLE>明白了吗
<32-4,CASTLE>Don't you see?

921
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,830
<32-4,CASTLE>破解凶案所需的一切
<32-4,CASTLE>Everything we need to solve this murder

922
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,620
<32-4,CASTLE>都在这段视频中
<32-4,CASTLE>is right there in that clip.

923
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,900
<32-4,CASTLE>画面渐黑
<32-4,CASTLE>Do a hard fade to black.

924
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,890
<32-4,CASTLE>来段音乐
<32-4,CASTLE>Musical sting.

925
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,260
<33-1,CASTLE>巴克·库珀是詹姆斯·斯旺的音乐导师
<33-1,CASTLE>Buck Cooper was James Swan's musical mentor, right?

926
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,130
<33-1,CASTLE>所以  拍电影的问起詹姆斯过去的事
<33-1,CASTLE>That's why, when the filmmaker asked James about his past,

927
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,090
<33-1,CASTLE>他便想到了他的好朋友巴克·库珀
<33-1,CASTLE>he automatically thought of his good friend Buck Cooper

928
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,500
<33-1,CASTLE>和他欠他的人情
<33-1,CASTLE>and how much he owed him.

929
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,880
<33-2,BECKETT>所以他决定把巴克救出公社
<33-2,BECKETT>Which is when he decided to rescue Buck from the compound

930
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,160
<33-2,BECKETT>并带他一起巡演
<33-2,BECKETT>and bring him on tour.

931
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
<33-3,CASTLE>但他觉得让巴克做管理员不合适
<33-3,CASTLE>But Buck as a roadie didn't seem fitting.

932
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,090
<33-3,CASTLE>毕竟詹姆斯认为他是比自己
<33-3,CASTLE>I mean, he was a better musician than James was,

933
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,150
<33-3,CASTLE>还出色的音乐家
<33-3,CASTLE>by James' own account.

934
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,070
<33-4,BECKETT>这就是詹姆斯所谓的
<33-4,BECKETT>That's what James meant

935
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,950
<33-4,BECKETT>要给巴克他应得的
<33-4,BECKETT>when he told Buck he wanted to make things right.

936
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,790
<33-4,BECKETT>他是指要把巴克纳入乐队
<33-4,BECKETT>He was talking about bringing Buck into the band.

937
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,050
<33-4,BECKETT>没错
<33-4,BECKETT>Exactly.

938
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,050
<33-5,CASTLE>这才是他一直所说的方向的改变
<33-5,CASTLE>That was the change in direction he kept talking about.

939
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:11,390
<33-5,CASTLE>所以他告诉基斯这会对大家都好
<33-5,CASTLE>It's why he told Keith it would be good for all of them,

940
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,170
<33-5,CASTLE>因为巴克是个优秀的音乐家
<33-5,CASTLE>because Buck is a great musician.

941
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,310
<33-6,RYAN>但是斯旺不是指所有人
<33-6,RYAN>Only Swan didn't really mean all of them,

942
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,790
<33-6,RYAN>因为吸纳了巴克  就得踢走一个人  谁呢
<33-6,RYAN>because if Buck was in, then someone else was out. But who?

943
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,740
<33-7,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  你还留着斯旺让
<33-7,CASTLE>Esposito, do you still have that sheet music

944
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,390
<33-7,CASTLE>那个作曲写的曲子吗
<33-7,CASTLE>that, uh, Swan commissioned from the songwriter?

945
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,460
<33-8,ESPOSITO>就在这儿
<33-8,ESPOSITO>It's right here.

946
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,590
<33-9,CASTLE>太好了
<33-9,CASTLE>Perfect.

947
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,290
<33-10,ESPOSITO>研究一下这首歌
<33-10,ESPOSITO>Working on the song a little.

948
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:28,200
<33-11,CASTLE>要知道这些可不是什么普通的强力和弦
<33-11,CASTLE>See, these aren't run-of-the-mill power chords.

949
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,140
<33-11,CASTLE>真正的高手才弹得出来
<33-11,CASTLE>You'd have to be pretty good to play th--

950
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,420
<33-11,CASTLE>特别是这一段
<33-11,CASTLE>Especially this part.

951
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,970
<34-1,ZEKE>可以  我能弹
<34-1,ZEKE>Yeah, I can play that.

952
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,590
<34-2,CASTLE>很好  齐克
<34-2,CASTLE>That's good news, Zeke.

953
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:47,810
<34-2,CASTLE>因为我们正好拿来了你的低音吉他
<34-2,CASTLE>Because we just so happen to have your bass guitar...

954
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,370
<34-2,CASTLE>就在这
<34-2,CASTLE>right here.

955
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,730
<34-2,CASTLE>挡到脸了  放低一点
<34-2,CASTLE>That's right in my face. A little lower.

956
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,130
<34-2,CASTLE>谢了  LT
<34-2,CASTLE>Thank you, L.T.

957
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,890
<34-3,ZEKE>好吧  我承认  我弹不了
<34-3,ZEKE>All right. Fine. I can't play it.

958
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,780
<34-3,ZEKE>这也证明不了什么
<34-3,ZEKE>That doesn't prove anything.

959
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,880
<34-3,ZEKE>没错
<34-3,ZEKE>No.

960
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,450
<34-4,BECKETT>但这个可以
<34-4,BECKETT>But this does.

961
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,880
<34-4,BECKETT>这是我们在你的拖车里发现的一张干洗店票据
<34-4,BECKETT>This is a dry cleaning ticket that we found in your trailer

962
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,320
<34-4,BECKETT>昨天你刚把衣服送过去
<34-4,BECKETT>for clothes that you dropped off yesterday.

963
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,270
<34-4,BECKETT>上面还有詹姆斯·斯旺的血迹斑点
<34-4,BECKETT>There are still flecks of James Swan's blood on them.

964
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,580
<34-4,BECKETT>你知不知道在那些
<34-4,BECKETT>Do you know what it's like

965
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,120
<34-5,ZEKE>破烂的街头集市表演是什么滋味
<34-5,ZEKE>to play all those crappy street fairs,

966
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,220
<34-5,ZEKE>成天靠拉面过活
<34-5,ZEKE>live on nothing but ramen noodles,

967
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,260
<34-5,ZEKE>在面包车里睡14个月
<34-5,ZEKE>sleep in a van for 14 months?

968
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,380
<34-5,ZEKE>然后他居然在演出结束后打电话让我去他的房车
<34-5,ZEKE>And then he calls me to his trailer after the show

969
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,520
<34-5,ZEKE>告诉我我就这么出局了
<34-5,ZEKE>and tells me that I'm out?

970
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,360
<34-5,ZEKE>我承认
<34-5,ZEKE>I admit,

971
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,770
<34-5,ZEKE>我不是最棒的电吉他手  可
<34-5,ZEKE>I might not be the world's greatest bass player, but--

972
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,650
<34-6,CASTLE>别谦虚  你用吉他用得挺好
<34-6,CASTLE>No, but you sure can handle a guitar.

973
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,970
<34-7,ZEKE>得了吧  伙计  我不是故意想杀他的
<34-7,ZEKE>Oh, come on, man! I didn't mean to kill him.

974
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,490
<34-7,ZEKE>我们终于要成就一番事业了
<34-7,ZEKE>We're finally about to hit it big,

975
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,590
<34-7,ZEKE>英国音乐家  在披头士乐队担任过鼓手
<34-7,ZEKE>后被乐队解雇  他从未得到令人满意的解释

976
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,560
<34-7,ZEKE>结果他居然为了某个技术工
<34-7,ZEKE>and he wants to "Pete Best" me

977
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,590
<34-7,ZEKE>想让我成为彼德·贝斯特
<34-7,ZEKE>for some roadie?!

978
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,410
<34-7,ZEKE>我
<34-7,ZEKE>I just--

979
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,640
<34-7,ZEKE>我就发飙了
<34-7,ZEKE>Ugh! I just lost it!

980
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,400
<34-7,ZEKE>天呐
<34-7,ZEKE>Ugh! God!

981
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,900
<34-8,CASTLE>不
<34-8,CASTLE>No.

982
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,020
<34-8,CASTLE>要知道彼德·贝斯特是个鼓手
<34-8,CASTLE>You know, Pete Best was a drummer.

984
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,950
<34-8,CASTLE>我觉得斯图·萨特克里夫才是更恰当的比喻
<34-8,CASTLE>I think Stu Sutcliffe would've been a more apt comparison.

985
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,360
<35-1,BUCK>真的很感谢你们为詹姆斯所做的一切
<35-1,BUCK>I really appreciate what you guys did for James.

986
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,500
<35-1,BUCK>我永远都不会忘记
<35-1,BUCK>And I'm always gonna appreciate that

987
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,240
<35-1,BUCK>我知道詹姆斯肯定也是
<35-1,BUCK>and... I know he does, too.

988
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,060
<35-2,CASTLE>我
<35-2,CASTLE>You know, I, uh...

989
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,260
<35-2,CASTLE>有东西要给你
<35-2,CASTLE>have something for you.

990
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,030
<35-2,CASTLE>詹姆斯也会希望你能得到它
<35-2,CASTLE>I think James would've wanted you to have it.

991
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,240
<35-2,CASTLE>这一段没那么容易弹奏
<35-2,CASTLE>The baseline is a little tricky,

992
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,260
<35-2,CASTLE>不过我想对你来说应该不成问题
<35-2,CASTLE>but I think you might be able to handle it.

993
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,520
<35-3,KEITH>齐克的事是真的吗
<35-3,KEITH>So it's true about Zeke?

994
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,260
<35-4,BECKETT>嗯  恐怕是这样
<35-4,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm afraid so.

995
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,320
<35-5,KEITH>这周可真惨啊
<35-5,KEITH>This has not been a good week.

996
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,190
<35-5,KEITH>我想告诉你  显而易见
<35-5,KEITH>I wanted to let you know, uh,

997
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,920
<35-5,KEITH>我们需要一个新贝斯手
<35-5,KEITH>we need a new bassist, obviously,

998
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,500
<35-5,KEITH>我正准备去见几个候选人
<35-5,KEITH>and I'm on my way to meet some guys right now,

999
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,480
<35-5,KEITH>不过我猜詹姆斯很看重你
<35-5,KEITH>but I guess James thought you were pretty good.

1000
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,350
<35-5,KEITH>所以如果你想来试音的话
<35-5,KEITH>So if you want to come audition...

1001
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,160
<35-6,BUCK>谢谢你  基斯  我会去的
<35-6,BUCK>Well, thanks, Keith. Yeah.

1002
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,900
<35-7,KEITH>不客气  伙计
<35-7,KEITH>Yeah, man.

1003
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,520
<35-8,GATES>各位注意
<35-8,GATES>Listen up, everyone.

1004
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,670
<35-8,GATES>我想在结案之际一如既往地
<35-8,GATES>I, uh, just wanted to commend all of you

1005
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,140
<35-8,GATES>表扬一下
<35-8,GATES>on a job well done,

1006
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,470
<35-8,GATES>大家的出色工作
<35-8,GATES>as I always do at the end of every case.

1007
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,000
<35-9,CASTLE>您的表扬让人觉得抓获一个凶手的辛苦都值了
<35-9,CASTLE>It's what makes catching a killer worthwhile.

1008
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,910
<35-9,CASTLE>但这说法很怪
<35-9,CASTLE>Which is strange, because you think it would be

1009
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,830
<35-9,CASTLE>抓凶手就应该很满足的  但不是那样的
<35-9,CASTLE>catching the killer, but no. It's...

1010
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,770
<35-10,BECKETT>长官
<35-10,BECKETT>Uh, sir.

<35-10,BECKETT>Are you still working on that?

<35-11,GATES>No, I got through it.

1015
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,760
<35-11,GATES>贝克特警探  卡塞尔先生
<35-11,GATES>In fact, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,

<36-2,BECKETT>长官  请容我们解释
<36-2,BECKETT>Sir, if you could just let us explain.

1019
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,960
<36-3,GATES>你们最好能给我说清楚
<36-3,GATES>Oh, you'd better.

1020
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,710
<36-3,GATES>我可不觉得这事很有趣
<36-3,GATES>Because I don't find this very funny.

1021
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,180
<36-4,GATES>我很自豪地说
<36-4,GATES>I am proud to say that I have the, uh,

<36-4,GATES>他们住在自己的分局
<36-4,GATES>Uh, they live here at the precinct.

<36-4,GATES>我们是一个团结的大家庭
<36-4,GATES>Uh, we are a close-knit family.

1029
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,800
<36-5,GATES>你觉得这种行为
<36-5,GATES>Would you call that behavior

1030
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,380
<36-5,GATES>在警察分局里是该有的吗
<36-5,GATES>appropriate for a police precinct?

1031
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,050
<36-6,CASTLE>不
<36-6,CASTLE>No.

1032
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,220
<36-7,GATES>没错
<36-7,GATES>You're damn right.

1033
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,090
<36-7,GATES>你们到底想给我造成什么样公共关系危机才罢休
<36-7,GATES>Just what kind of P.R. debacle are you trying to inflict on me?

1034
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,000
<36-8,BECKETT>对不起  长官

<36-9,GATES>-就这个吗  -就这个还不够吗
<36-9,GATES>- That--that's it? - That's not enough?

1037
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,640
<36-9,GATES>难道还有别的什么我应该注意的
<36-9,GATES>Is there something else I should be looking for?

1038
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,090
<36-9,GATES>是他们说少了的那部分视频吗
<36-9,GATES>Like something on that tape they say is missing?

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,510
<36-11,GATES>外头这又是怎么回事
<36-11,GATES>What kind of foolishness is going on out there?

1042
