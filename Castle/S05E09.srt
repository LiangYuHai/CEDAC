9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,370
<1-1,MOM>亲爱的  那是什么
<1-1,MOM>Honey, what is that?

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,310
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>找到了
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Found it.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,320
<2-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸  扔了吧  怪恶心的
<2-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad, you should toss that. It's getting kind of gross.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,740
<2-3,CASTLE>扔掉饼干天使  才不呢
<2-3,CASTLE>Toss cookie angel? No way.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,720
<2-3,CASTLE>这是你一年级时做了送我的
<2-3,CASTLE>You made this for me in first grade...

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,830
<2-3,CASTLE>用你那胖乎乎的小手
<2-3,CASTLE>With your chubby little hands.

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,530
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>亲爱的  麻烦再帮我
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>Darling, could you pick me up

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,150
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>拿一瓶烈酒做圣诞甜酒
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>an extra bottle of aquavit for our glogg?

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,260
<2-5,CASTLE>再来瓶烈酒
<2-5,CASTLE>An extra bottle of 100 proof?

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,030
<2-5,CASTLE>你不是在篡改咱们神圣的圣诞甜酒配方吧
<2-5,CASTLE>You're not tampering with our sacred holiday recipe?

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,110
<2-6,MARTHA>不是  我只是多做一大份
<2-6,MARTHA>No, no, no. I'm just gonna make an extra-large batch

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,120
<2-6,MARTHA>在平安夜唱颂歌时带上
<2-6,MARTHA>to take with me christmas eve caroling.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,950
<2-6,MARTHA>当然  是在我们吃完平安夜晚餐后
<2-6,MARTHA>Oh, it'll be after our christmas dinner.

22
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,070
<2-6,MARTHA>你不介意吧
<2-6,MARTHA>You don't mind, do you?

23
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,920
<2-7,CASTLE>但那是平安夜啊  是我们拆礼物的时候
<2-7,CASTLE>But it's christmas eve. That's when we open the gifts.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
<2-8,ALEXIS>圣诞节早上拆也可以啊
<2-8,ALEXIS>Well, maybe we can open them in the morning.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,580
<2-9,CASTLE>早上  早上是长袜惊喜的时间
<2-9,CASTLE>In the morning? Mornings are for stockings.

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,620
<2-10,MARTHA>我想
<2-10,MARTHA>Well, I-I think--

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,140
<2-10,MARTHA>我想阿丽克西斯是想说
<2-10,MARTHA>I think what Alexis is trying to say

28
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,550
<2-10,MARTHA>她也另有安排了
<2-10,MARTHA>is that she has other plans, too.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,680
<2-11,ALEXIS>只是和朋友们一起  只是...
<2-11,ALEXIS>Just with a couple of friends. It's...

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,070
<2-12,CASTLE>什么朋友  什么安排
<2-12,CASTLE>What friends? What plans?

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:20,460
<2-12,CASTLE>那我们的家族传统怎么办
<2-12,CASTLE>What is happening to our family tradition?

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,490
<2-13,ALEXIS>爸  我觉得你的反应有点夸张
<2-13,ALEXIS>Dad, I think you're kind of overreacting.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,290
<3-1,CASTLE>我没有反应夸张
<3-1,CASTLE>I am not overreacting.

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,180
<3-1,CASTLE>一年就这么一天
<3-1,CASTLE>It's--its one night out of the year.

35
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,620
<3-1,CASTLE>要求按传统来很过分吗
<3-1,CASTLE>Is it too much to ask to stick to the program?

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,750
<3-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>也许你的传统应该变通下
<3-2,DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT>Maybe your program should evolve a little.

37
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,850
<3-3,CASTLE>有变通啊  我不是邀请了你吗
<3-3,CASTLE>It is evolving. I invited you, didn't I?

38
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,700
<3-3,CASTLE>你会来吧
<3-3,CASTLE>You are still coming, right?

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,120
<3-4,BECKETT>来  只要我不用工作
<3-4,BECKETT>Uh, ye--I mean, if I don't have to work.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,890
<3-4,BECKETT>但听着  不送礼物  知道吗
<3-4,BECKETT>But look, okay. No presents, remember?

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,550
<3-4,BECKETT>我们说好的  只是
<3-4,BECKETT>We promised. It's just--

42
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,000
<3-4,BECKETT>这是我们在一起后第一个圣诞  有点压力
<3-4,BECKETT>It's a little too stressful this first year.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,810
<3-4,BECKETT>不送礼物
<3-4,BECKETT>No presents.

44
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,840
<3-5,CASTLE>我这人很灵活的
<3-5,CASTLE>I'm flexible.

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,550
<3-5,CASTLE>圣诞节的有些精髓是经过时间考验的
<3-5,CASTLE>There are certain aspects to this that are time honored--

46
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,700
<3-5,CASTLE>那种心情
<3-5,CASTLE>The...the heart..

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,980
<3-5,CASTLE>圣诞节带来的那种心跳加速的感觉
<3-5,CASTLE>The beating heart behind the christmas holidays.

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,120
<3-5,CASTLE>现在连圣诞老人都挂了吗
<3-5,CASTLE>And now Santa is dead?

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,270
<3-5,CASTLE>有没有搞错啊
<3-5,CASTLE>When will it end?

50
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,490
<3-6,BECKETT>不想打破你的美梦  卡塞尔
<3-6,BECKETT>Hate to break it to you, Castle,

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,390
<3-6,BECKETT>不过圣诞老人是不存在的
<3-6,BECKETT>but there is no Santa.

52
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,250
<3-7,CASTLE>不再存在了
<3-7,CASTLE>Well, not anymore.

53
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,100
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>你得承认  那一脸胡须加大肚腩
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>You gotta admit, with that beard and that belly,

54
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,410
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>这位圣诞老人还挺货真价实的
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>he looks like the real deal.

55
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,040
<3-9,BECKETT>如果说"货真价实"是指
<3-9,BECKETT>If by "The real deal," you mean

56
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,820
<3-9,BECKETT>一位穿着红衣的体重超标人士
<3-9,BECKETT>an overweight man in a red suit

57
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,840
<3-9,BECKETT>希望他带着身份证
<3-9,BECKETT>who was hopefully carrying I.D.

58
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
<3-9,BECKETT>带着呢
<3-9,BECKETT>Yeah.

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,420
<3-10,LANIE>还有许多拐杖糖的包装纸
<3-10,LANIE>Along with lots of candy canes wrappers.

60
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,580
<3-10,LANIE>不过我觉得他的身份证
<3-10,LANIE>Though I don't think that I.D. of his

61
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,640
<3-10,LANIE>对你没什么帮助
<3-10,LANIE>is gonna do you much good.

62
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,430
<3-11,BECKETT>姓名"圣诞老人"  地址"北极"
<3-11,BECKETT>"Kris Kringle." Address...north pole?

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,390
<3-11,BECKETT>真可爱
<3-11,BECKETT>That's cute.

64
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,140
<3-12,CASTLE>也许他真的是圣诞老人
<3-12,CASTLE>Maybe he's the real Santa,

65
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,670
<3-12,CASTLE>就像电影《34街的奇迹》
<3-12,CASTLE>like in "Miracle on 34th street."

66
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,710
<3-13,LANIE>是啊  只可惜不是快乐大结局
<3-13,LANIE>Yeah, but with no happy ending.

67
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,450
<3-13,LANIE>这位圣诞老人在9点半左右从天上掉下来
<3-13,LANIE>This Santa fell out of the sky around 9:30.

68
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,530
<3-14,BECKETT>从飞机上吗
<3-14,BECKETT>From an aircraft?

69
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,450
<3-15,LANIE>有可能  但不是民航
<3-15,LANIE>Maybe, but it wasn't a commercial plane,

70
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,630
<3-15,LANIE>这点可以肯定
<3-15,LANIE>I can tell you that.

71
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,250
<3-15,LANIE>如果从高空跌落
<3-15,LANIE>With a fall from high altitude,

72
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,700
<3-15,LANIE>眼睛和面部会出现冻伤
<3-15,LANIE>we'd see severe frostbite on his eyes and his face.

73
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,310
<3-16,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>我问过那家人了
<3-16,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>Hey. So I just talked with the family.

74
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,220
<3-16,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>他们没看到也没听到有飞机飞过
<3-16,DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN>They didn't see or hear any planes overhead.

75
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,470
<3-17,BECKETT>这样说不通
<3-17,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

76
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,360
<3-17,BECKETT>他肯定是从哪里掉下来的
<3-17,BECKETT>He had to have fallen from somewhere.

77
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,310
<3-17,BECKETT>打扰下
<3-17,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

78
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,550
<3-18,CASTLE>这么明显大家没看到吗
<3-18,CASTLE>Are we overlooking the obvious here?

79
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,190
<3-18,CASTLE>他遭遇了气流  从雪橇上滑落
<3-18,CASTLE>He hit some turbulence, slipped out of his sleigh,

80
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,480
<3-18,CASTLE>就此丧命
<3-18,CASTLE>and fell to his doom.

81
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,430
<3-19,RYAN>圣诞老人  死在了那里
<3-19,RYAN>Santa... lying there dead.

82
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,850
<3-19,RYAN>禁不住问自己  我们活在怎样的世界啊
<3-19,RYAN>You gotta ask yourself, what kind of world do we live in?

83
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,710
<3-20,BECKETT>活在不存在圣诞老人的世界
<3-20,BECKETT>A world in which there is no Santa

84
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,820
<3-20,BECKETT>而且人不会凭空从空中掉落
<3-20,BECKETT>and people don't fall out of nowhere.

85
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,430
<3-20,BECKETT>麻烦你去查下飞行管制中心
<3-20,BECKETT>Can you check with air traffic control

86
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,510
<3-20,BECKETT>看看这地区有什么飞机经过
<3-20,BECKETT>and find out what flights were in the area?

87
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,340
<3-21,RYAN>好的  去他的圣诞节
<3-21,RYAN>Sure. Bah humbug.

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,690
<3-22,BECKETT>是摔死的吗
<3-22,BECKETT>So was the fall cause of death?

89
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,210
<3-23,LANIE>看起来是的  但只有送回
<3-23,LANIE>It looks like it, but I won't know for sure

90
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,870
<3-23,LANIE>验尸房才知道具体情况
<3-23,LANIE>until I get him back to the morgue.

91
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,330
<3-24,CASTLE>无论是不是圣诞老人  他都很投入
<3-24,CASTLE>Well, Santa or no, he sure is committed.

92
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,320
<3-24,CASTLE>你说他的钱包是空的
<3-24,CASTLE>And you're saying there's nothing in his wallet

93
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,080
<3-24,CASTLE>-没东西鉴定他的身份  -是的
<3-24,CASTLE>- that indicates a break in character? - Nope.

94
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,580
<3-26,BECKETT>除了这双靴子
<3-26,BECKETT>Except for these boots.

95
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,830
<3-26,BECKETT>肯定不是北极的
<3-26,BECKETT>They are definitely not from the north pole.

96
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,640
<3-26,BECKETT>这是皇后区一家皮鞋店定做的
<3-26,BECKETT>They're custom made from a leather shop in Queens.

97
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,050
<3-26,BECKETT>我曾经定做过摩托车靴子
<3-26,BECKETT>Got a pair of motorcycle boots there.

98
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,640
<3-26,BECKETT>希望他们有记录可以鉴定他的身份
<3-26,BECKETT>Hopefully they'll have a record of who this man is.

99
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,430
<4-1,RYAN>飞行管制中心回信了
<4-1,RYAN>Hey. So I heard from air traffic control

100
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,160
<4-1,RYAN>但结果你肯定不爱听
<4-1,RYAN>but you're not gonna like the news.

101
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,790
<4-1,RYAN>被害人落地时  中心没有记录
<4-1,RYAN>They have no record of anyone flying over the park

102
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,450
<4-1,RYAN>有飞机飞过公园
<4-1,RYAN>during the time our guy hit the ground.

103
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,960
<4-2,BECKETT>这怎么可能呢
<4-2,BECKETT>How is that even possible?

104
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,440
<4-3,CASTLE>圣诞老人的雪橇进入了隐形模式
<4-3,CASTLE>Santa had his sleigh in stealth mode.

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,580
<4-4,BECKETT>不  我是说911之后  怎么可能
<4-4,BECKETT>No. I mean, after 9/11, how is it possible

106
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,010
<4-4,BECKETT>有人能飞过曼哈顿
<4-4,BECKETT>that someone can just fly over Manhattan?

107
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,100
<4-5,CASTLE>观光直升机一直在飞
<4-5,CASTLE>Sightseeing choppers do it all the time.

108
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,810
<4-5,CASTLE>有一次  我在午夜绕着
<4-5,CASTLE>There was this one time, I took a midnight loop

109
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,040
<4-5,CASTLE>自由女神像兜了一圈  同行的是一位拉丁
<4-5,CASTLE>around the statue of liberty with this latin...

110
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,090
<4-5,CASTLE>出版商
<4-5,CASTLE>Publisher.

111
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,320
<4-5,CASTLE>他说的对
<4-5,CASTLE>No, he's right.

112
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,810
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>曼哈顿飞行管制中心
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>There's Manhattan flight corridor

113
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,560
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>不要求上报飞行
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>which doesn't require you to radio in

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,800
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>只要高度在1300英尺以下就可以
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>if you stay under 1,300 feet.

115
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,840
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我婆婆是持牌飞行员
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>My mother-in-law is a licensed pilot,

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>她一再提醒我这点
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>as she keeps reminding me.

117
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,300
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>很大程度上让我感觉自己很挫
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Part of a larger effort to make me feel inferior.

118
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,440
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>抱歉  刚才这句我有说出声吗
<4-6,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>I'm sorry. Did I just say that out loud?

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,400
<4-7,RYAN>听起来她和你住一起  警监
<4-7,RYAN>Sounds like she's staying with you, Captain?

120
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,940
<4-8,GATES>很快会有一天  你的岳父母也会来
<4-8,GATES>One day soon, your in-laws will visit, too,

121
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,510
<4-8,GATES>他们来了后
<4-8,GATES>And when they do,

122
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,210
<4-8,GATES>住酒店才是明智的
<4-8,GATES>think hotel.

123
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,680
<4-8,GATES>上帝啊  我讨厌过节
<4-8,GATES>Lord, I hate the holidays.

124
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,960
<4-9,CASTLE>她和圣诞怪杰又有了一处共同特质
<4-9,CASTLE>Yet another quality she has in common with the Grinch.

125
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,530
<4-10,BECKETT>如果不知道圣诞老人是从哪里落下的
<4-10,BECKETT>So if we don't know where our Santa fell from,

126
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,050
<4-10,BECKETT>至少知道他是谁了吧
<4-10,BECKETT>do we at least know who he is?

127
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,200
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>希望很快知道
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>Well, hopefully we will soon.

128
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,230
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>警员已经通知了皇后区靴店的老板
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>Unis rousted the owner of that boot store in Queens.

129
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,380
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>让他开了店查发票记录
<4-11,DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO>They're getting him to open up the shop and check his invoices.

130
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,360
<4-12,BECKETT>蕾妮那边有消息
<4-12,BECKETT>Lanie's got something for us.

131
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,770
<4-12,BECKETT>-靴子有消息了就告诉我  -好的
<4-12,BECKETT>- Can you keep us posted on the boots? - Yeah.

132
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,690
<4-14,ESPOSITO>这案子让你很难受啊  兄弟
<4-14,ESPOSITO>You're taking this one kinda hard, bro.

133
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,780
<4-15,RYAN>他是纯真童年的象征
<4-15,RYAN>He's a symbol of childhood innocence.

134
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,440
<4-15,RYAN>让我琢磨这对未来意味着什么
<4-15,RYAN>Makes me wonder what this means for the future.

135
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,230
<4-16,ESPOSITO>意味着少了一个打扮成圣诞老人的人
<4-16,ESPOSITO>It means there's gonna be one less guy dressed up as Santa.

136
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,310
<4-16,ESPOSITO>嘿  平安夜快到了
<4-16,ESPOSITO>Hey, so, uh, we're coming up on christmas eve.

137
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,870
<4-16,ESPOSITO>今年继续照传统吗
<4-16,ESPOSITO>We gonna keep the tradition going?

138
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,810
<4-16,ESPOSITO>兄弟两个  六罐啤酒  对着电视彻夜狂欢
<4-16,ESPOSITO>You, me, a six-pack, madden on the big screen?

139
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,480
<4-17,RYAN>知道吗
<4-17,RYAN>You know, I, um...

140
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,010
<4-17,RYAN>我想珍妮今年有了其它的安排
<4-17,RYAN>I think Jenny has other plans this year.

141
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,120
<4-17,RYAN>好吧
<4-17,RYAN>Yeah.

142
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,550
<5-1,LANIE>还记得你问是不是摔死的吗
<5-1,LANIE>Remember how you asked if that fall is what killed him?

143
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,670
<5-1,LANIE>不是的
<5-1,LANIE>Well, it wasn't.

144
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,700
<5-1,LANIE>从背部取出来的
<5-1,LANIE>I pulled this out of his back.

145
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,230
<5-2,BECKETT>这是点38
<5-2,BECKETT>And that is a .38.

146
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,780
<5-2,BECKETT>你依然觉得他是从雪橇上掉下来的吗  卡塞尔
<5-2,BECKETT>Do you still think he fell off his sleigh, Castle?

147
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,500
<5-3,CASTLE>不  很显然  他是中枪后掉下来的
<5-3,CASTLE>No. Clearly, he was shot out of it.

148
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,930
<5-3,CASTLE>圣诞节的战争啊
<5-3,CASTLE>Talk about a war on Christmas.

149
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,240
<5-4,BECKETT>或者他就是在飞机上被枪杀后被扔了下来
<5-4,BECKETT>Or he was just shot in an aircraft and pushed out.

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,320
<5-4,BECKETT>还有其它情况吗
<5-4,BECKETT>So we have anything else?

151
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,160
<5-5,LANIE>还有这个  嵌在衣服里的
<5-5,LANIE>Just this... embedded in his suit.

152
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,390
<5-5,LANIE>一小块颜料
<5-5,LANIE>A chip of paint

153
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,730
<5-5,LANIE>或是某种瓷釉  樱桃红的
<5-5,LANIE>or some kind of enamel, cherry red.

154
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,820
<5-6,CASTLE>雪橇车上的
<5-6,CASTLE>From a sleigh.

155
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,840
<5-7,LANIE>这我还不知道
<5-7,LANIE>I don't know yet.

156
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,050
<5-7,LANIE>一会送去实验室检查
<5-7,LANIE>I'm sending it down to the lab for analysis.

157
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,230
<5-8,CASTLE>很可能是雪橇车上的
<5-8,CASTLE>Probably from a sleigh.

158
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,240
<5-9,BECKETT>我们对他的身份还是没有一点头绪吗
<5-9,BECKETT>Are we any closer to figuring out who he is?

159
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,420
<5-10,ESPOSITO>现在有了
<5-10,ESPOSITO>We are now.

160
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,110
<5-10,ESPOSITO>他叫艾德蒙德·史密斯  住在布朗克斯
<5-10,ESPOSITO>Name's Edmund Smith. Lives in the Bronx.

161
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,070
<5-10,ESPOSITO>我在鞋店查到了他的身份
<5-10,ESPOSITO>I got his I.D. from that boot shop.

162
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,220
<5-11,BECKETT>不好意思  你难道是专程来给我这个的吗
<5-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry. You just came all the way down here to give me this?

163
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,290
<5-12,ESPOSITO>是啊  你不是说过一有消息就要通知你吗
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah. I mean, you told me to keep you posted.

164
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,080
<5-12,ESPOSITO>你说过的吧
<5-12,ESPOSITO>You did say that, right?

165
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,160
<5-13,BECKETT>好吧  我和卡塞尔要去那里
<5-13,BECKETT>You know what? Uh, Castle and I are gonna go and check out

166
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,010
<5-13,BECKETT>看看有没有什么线索
<5-13,BECKETT>the place and see what there is to see.

167
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,770
<5-13,BECKETT>好吧
<5-13,BECKETT>Okay.

168
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,180
<5-14,LANIE>哈维  你什么时候也开始喷香水上班了
<5-14,LANIE>Javi, since when did you start wearing cologne to work?

169
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,420
<5-15,ESPOSITO>这不是节日嘛
<5-15,ESPOSITO>Oh, you know, well, it's the holidays,

170
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,620
<5-15,ESPOSITO>我有应酬  有朋友要见
<5-15,ESPOSITO>and I've got places to be, people to see.

171
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,680
<5-15,ESPOSITO>你呢
<5-15,ESPOSITO>How about you?

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,950
<5-16,LANIE>行了  我知道怎么回事了
<5-16,LANIE>Okay. I see where this is going.

173
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,630
<5-16,LANIE>我得就此打住
<5-16,LANIE>I'm gonna stop you right there.

174
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,300
<5-16,LANIE>圣诞夜我已经有安排了
<5-16,LANIE>I already have plans for Christmas Eve.

175
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,030
<5-16,LANIE>我要和我的女朋友们一起过
<5-16,LANIE>I'm hanging out with my girlfriends.

176
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,560
<5-17,ESPOSITO>哦  挺好的
<5-17,ESPOSITO>Oh. That's cool.

177
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,720
<5-17,ESPOSITO>那之后  说不定我们可以...
<5-17,ESPOSITO>Maybe afterwards, you and I can--

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,710
<5-18,LANIE>哈维  我们别像那些悲催绝望的假日搭档一样
<5-18,LANIE>Javi, let's not be one of those sad, desperate holiday hookups.

179
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,510
<5-18,LANIE>但等一切都平静下来
<5-18,LANIE>But when all this dies down,

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,800
<5-18,LANIE>如果你还想在一起
<5-18,LANIE>if you still want to get together,

181
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,910
<5-18,LANIE>给我打个电话就行
<5-18,LANIE>just give me a call.

182
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,380
<6-1,BETH CABOT>我想他不在家
<6-1,BETH CABOT>Um, I-I don't think he's home.

183
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,300
<6-2,BECKETT>纽约警察  这里有没有管理员
<6-2,BECKETT>NYPD. Is there a super or someone

184
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,410
<6-2,BECKETT>可以让我们进去
<6-2,BECKETT>that can let us into this apartment?

185
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,930
<6-3,BETH>我们有钥匙
<6-3,BETH>Yeah, um, we have a key.

186
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,740
<6-3,BETH>蒂姆  把艾德家的钥匙拿来好吗
<6-3,BETH>Tim, can you grab Ed's key?

187
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,670
<6-3,BETH>艾德蒙德出什么事了吗
<6-3,BETH>Did, uh, something happen to Edmund?

188
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,660
<6-3,BETH>你最后一次见他是什么时候
<6-3,BETH>So when was the last time you saw him?

189
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,240
<7-1,BECKETT>应该是昨天晚上5点左右
<7-1,BECKETT>Well, it must have been last night around 5:00.

190
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,900
<7-2,BETH>我看见他带着道具包离开
<7-2,BETH>Uh, I saw him leave with his costume bag.

191
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,970
<7-2,BETH>我猜他是出去干活了
<7-2,BETH>I figured he was going on a job.

192
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,220
<7-3,TIM CABOT>艾德是个职业圣诞老人
<7-3,TIM CABOT>Ed was a professional Santa.

193
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,270
<7-4,CASTLE>看来他对他的工作很认真
<7-4,CASTLE>Looks like he took his job pretty seriously.

194
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,650
<7-5,BETH>他真是以此为生
<7-5,BETH>Oh, he lived it, really.

195
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,930
<7-5,BETH>他会无偿去休闲中心和庇护所扮演圣诞老人
<7-5,BETH>I mean, volunteering at the rec center and the shelter.

196
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,870
<7-5,BETH>他也一直陪着蒂姆和我的孩子们
<7-5,BETH>He was always here for Tim and the kids.

197
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,920
<7-5,BETH>他甚至还帮我们打官司
<7-5,BETH>He--he even helped with our lawsuit.

198
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,400
<7-6,CASTLE>他即是圣诞老人又是律师吗
<7-6,CASTLE>He was a santa and a lawyer?

199
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,300
<7-7,BETH>不  我们失去了我们的房子
<7-7,BETH>No, um, we lost our house,

200
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,050
<7-7,BETH>他正在帮助我们解决
<7-7,BETH>and he was just trying to help us out.

201
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,380
<7-7,BETH>他就是这样的人
<7-7,BETH>He was like that.

202
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,450
<7-8,BECKETT>看来他融入了很多人的生活
<7-8,BECKETT>Sounds like he got involved in a lot of people's lives.

203
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,990
<7-8,BECKETT>你觉得他有仇敌吗
<7-8,BECKETT>Do you think he made any enemies along the way?

204
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,910
<7-9,BETH>应该没有  不过上星期
<7-9,BETH>I didn't think so, but then last week,

205
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,600
<7-9,BETH>我听到有个人在敲艾德的门
<7-9,BETH>I heard this man pounding on Ed's door,

206
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,270
<7-9,BETH>还骂着很多难听的话
<7-9,BETH>shouting cuss words.

207
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,510
<7-10,BECKETT>你看见是谁了吗
<7-10,BECKETT>Did you see who it was?

208
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,670
<7-11,TIM>我看到了  我出来看了一下
<7-11,TIM>I did. I-I looked out.

209
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,600
<7-11,TIM>是个看起来挺粗暴的老头
<7-11,TIM>It was an--an older, tough-looking dude.

210
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,630
<7-11,TIM>他看到我说
<7-11,TIM>When he saw me, he said,

211
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,220
<7-11,TIM>你告诉艾德  要是再让我看见  他就死定了
<7-11,TIM>"You tell Ed if I see him again, I'll kill him."

212
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,890
<7-11,TIM>于是我告诉了艾德
<7-11,TIM>So I-I told Ed.

213
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,400
<7-12,CASTLE>他什么反应
<7-12,CASTLE>How did he react?

214
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,620
<7-13,BETH>他叫我们别担心
<7-13,BETH>Well, he told us not to worry,

215
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,610
<7-13,BETH>但能看得出来  他挺心烦的
<7-13,BETH>but you could tell he was pretty shaken up.

216
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,840
<7-14,BECKETT>你能描述一下他吗
<7-14,BECKETT>You think you could describe him?

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,670
<7-15,TIM>知道吗  不需要描述  这就是他
<7-15,TIM>You know what? I-I don't have to. That's him.

218
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,700
<7-16,CASTLE>不管他是谁  他是个飞行员
<7-16,CASTLE>Well, whoever he is, he's a pilot.

219
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,170
<8-1,RYAN>根据在塞斯纳飞机公司的尾号登记
<8-1,RYAN>According to the tail number on that Cessna...

220

<8-2,BECKETT>Where do we find him?

224
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,120

<9-2,CASTLE>from some lake I can't pronounce by the Canadian border,

231

247
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,780
<9-18,BECKETT>我敢打赌你们少了一个圣诞老人
<9-18,BECKETT>And I bet you one Santa is missing.

248

<9-18,BECKETT>吼  吼  吼
<9-18,BECKETT>Ho! Ho! Ho!

258
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,190
<10-1,DUNNE>太疯狂了  我没杀艾德蒙德
<10-1,DUNNE>This is crazy. I did not kill Edmund.

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,960
<10-2,CASTLE>相信我  这种老套说辞
<10-2,CASTLE>Trust me. You're gonna have to do

260
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,460
<10-2,CASTLE>可没法说服她
<10-2,CASTLE>a lot better than that to convince her.

261
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,820
<10-3,BECKETT>你可以从你的上次飞行说起
<10-3,BECKETT>You can start by telling us when you last flew your plane.

262
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,540
<10-4,DUNNE>好几个星期没飞了  你们可以查
<10-4,DUNNE>Not for weeks. You can check.

263
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,830
<10-5,BECKETT>我们会查的  昨晚9点半你在哪里
<10-5,BECKETT>We intend to. Now where were you at 9:30 last night?

264
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,530
<10-6,DUNNE>我在哈莱姆青少年活动中心
<10-6,DUNNE>I was at the Harlem Youth Center

265
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,220
<10-6,DUNNE>给孩子们发礼物
<10-6,DUNNE>handing out gifts to kids.

266
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,820
<10-6,DUNNE>我没见过艾德蒙德
<10-6,DUNNE>I wasn't anywhere near Edmund.

267
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,560
<10-7,CASTLE>可你在他的公寓表现得可不太像圣诞老人
<10-7,CASTLE>But you did engage in some un-santa-like behavior at his apartment.

268
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,320
<10-8,DUNNE>是为了这事啊
<10-8,DUNNE>That what this is about?

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,000
<10-8,DUNNE>根本没事
<10-8,DUNNE>That was nothing.

270
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,380
<10-9,BECKETT>你威胁说要杀了他  而他现在死了
<10-9,BECKETT>You threatened to kill him, and now he's dead.

271
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,800
<10-9,BECKETT>我可不觉得那叫没事
<10-9,BECKETT>I wouldn't call that nothing.

272
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,380
<10-10,DUNNE>我能解释
<10-10,DUNNE>I can explain that, okay?

273
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,060
<10-10,DUNNE>艾德蒙德抢走了我最好的一份工作
<10-10,DUNNE>See, Edmund took one of my best gigs.

274
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,040
<10-10,DUNNE>卡地亚的平面广告
<10-10,DUNNE>It was a print AD for Cartier.

275
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,970
<10-10,DUNNE>我是他们最好的圣诞老人
<10-10,DUNNE>I was their go-to Santa.

276
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,810
<10-10,DUNNE>知道吗  今年他们想要更和气更可爱的圣诞老人
<10-10,DUNNE>You know, this year they wanted to go more warm and cuddly.

277
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,760
<10-10,DUNNE>看看我  我很和气  也很可爱
<10-10,DUNNE>Well, look at me. I-I'm warm. I'm cuddly.

278
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,000
<10-10,DUNNE>但是  不  他们选择了艾德蒙德
<10-10,DUNNE>But, no. They chose Edmund.

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,530
<10-10,DUNNE>没错  我是喝了不少薄荷杜松子酒
<10-10,DUNNE>So, yeah, I drank too much peppermint schnapps

280
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,500
<10-10,DUNNE>去到他的公寓  怒气冲冲地胡说
<10-10,DUNNE>and went over to his place and popped off.

281
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,810
<10-10,DUNNE>我也很惭愧
<10-10,DUNNE>I'm not proud of it,

282
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,700
<10-10,DUNNE>但仅此而已
<10-10,DUNNE>but that was all I did.

283
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,870
<10-11,BECKETT>之后你有见过他吗
<10-11,BECKETT>Did you see him again after that?

284
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,530
<10-12,DUNNE>没有  你们得理解
<10-12,DUNNE>No. You have to understand,

285
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,350
<10-12,DUNNE>五年前  当我第一次遇到艾德蒙德
<10-12,DUNNE>when I first met Edmund five years ago,

286
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,140
<10-12,DUNNE>他正处于人生最低谷
<10-12,DUNNE>he was at a low point in life.

287
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,500
<10-12,DUNNE>是我帮助了他  教给他我所知道的一切
<10-12,DUNNE>I raised him up. I taught him everything I knew.

288
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,980
<10-12,DUNNE>是我把他变成了世界级的圣诞老人
<10-12,DUNNE>I turned him into a world-class Santa,

289
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,340
<10-12,DUNNE>而现在我反而还因他丢了工作
<10-12,DUNNE>and now I'm losing gigs to him?

290
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,330
<10-12,DUNNE>也许这就是命
<10-12,DUNNE>Well, maybe that's it.

291
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,500
<10-12,DUNNE>也许是时候摘下这顶毛绒绒的红色内裤了
<10-12,DUNNE>Maybe it's time to hang up the fluffy red jockstrap.

292
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,530
<10-13,CASTLE>这是打比方还是你真的...
<10-13,CASTLE>Is... Is that a metaphor or do you really--

293
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,080
<10-14,BECKETT>艾德蒙德被害的时候
<10-14,BECKETT>Uh, when Edmund was killed,

294
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,550
<10-14,BECKETT>他还穿着圣诞老人服装
<10-14,BECKETT>he was wearing his Santa suit.

295
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,360
<10-14,BECKETT>你知道昨晚他有工作吗
<10-14,BECKETT>Do you know if he had a job last night?

296
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
<10-15,DUNNE>你得去问问他的经纪人
<10-15,DUNNE>You'd have to ask his agent.

297
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
<10-16,CASTLE>圣诞老人还有经纪人
<10-16,CASTLE>Santas have agents?

298
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,470
<10-17,DUNNE>对  我们大多用的是贝荷经纪公司
<10-17,DUNNE>Yeah. Mostly we use the Bells & Holly agency.

299
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,070
<10-18,CASTLE>你刚才说艾德蒙德处于人生的低谷
<10-18,CASTLE>You said Edmund was at a low point in his life.

300
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,550
<10-18,CASTLE>那话是什么意思
<10-18,CASTLE>What did you mean by that?

301
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,000
<10-19,DUNNE>我只是觉得  他做圣诞老人是想改变自己的人生
<10-19,DUNNE>I just think he became a Santa to turn his life around.

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,320
<10-19,DUNNE>事实上也确实成功了
<10-19,DUNNE>And it worked, too.

303
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
<10-20,BECKETT>改变他的人生
<10-20,BECKETT>Turn his life around?

304
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,700
<10-20,BECKETT>他之前招了什么麻烦吗
<10-20,BECKETT>Was he in trouble of some sort?

305
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,680
<10-21,DUNNE>我只知道  在我刚认识艾德蒙德时
<10-21,DUNNE>All I know is, back when I met him,

306
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,210
<10-21,DUNNE>他与现在判若两人
<10-21,DUNNE>Edmund was a totally different guy.

307
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,310
<11-1,RYAN>大卫·邓恩的不在场证明已证实
<11-1,RYAN>David Dunne's alibi checked out.

308
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,710
<11-1,RYAN>哈勒姆青少年俱乐部说他昨晚的确在那
<11-1,RYAN>Harlem Youth Club said that he was there last night.

309
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,000
<11-1,RYAN>他的飞机也至少有一个月没起飞过了
<11-1,RYAN>And the Cessna has been parked in a hangar for over a month.

310
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,870
<11-2,BECKETT>你知道艾德蒙德接了什么扮演圣诞的活吗
<11-2,BECKETT>Did you find out what Santa job Edmund was doing?

311
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,000
<11-3,RYAN>他的经纪公司说昨晚他并没有活动
<11-3,RYAN>His agency said he wasn't booked on any gigs last night.

312
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
<11-4,BECKETT>那他为什么会穿道具服呢
<11-4,BECKETT>So then why was he wearing his Santa suit

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,470
<11-4,BECKETT>以及他是怎么死的
<11-4,BECKETT>and how'd he end up dead?

314
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,380
<11-5,CASTLE>如果这是个故事
<11-5,CASTLE>Well, if this was a story,

315
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,100
<11-5,CASTLE>我们是不是应该先弄清这个角色的背景
<11-5,CASTLE>it would all come back to Edmund's character..

316
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,000
<11-5,CASTLE>他为什么会去做圣诞老人呢
<11-5,CASTLE>why he became a Santa in the first place.

317
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,250
<11-6,ESPOSITO>结果  这也是个谜
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out, that's a mystery all by itself.

318
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,550
<11-6,ESPOSITO>我一直在查他的历史资料  你们看
<11-6,ESPOSITO>I've been looking into this guy, and check it.

319
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,110
<11-6,ESPOSITO>这就是我们的圣诞老人五年前的样子
<11-6,ESPOSITO>That is Santa five years ago.

320
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,000
<11-6,ESPOSITO>见见詹姆斯·艾德蒙德·史密斯
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Meet James Edmund Smith.

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,370
<11-6,ESPOSITO>他曾是一家大公司的私人股权经理人
<11-6,ESPOSITO>He was a private equity manager at some big firm.

322
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,150
<11-7,BECKETT>-他俩是同一个人  -对
<11-7,BECKETT>- That's the same guy? - Yeah.

323
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,980
<11-9,BECKETT>期间出了什么事
<11-9,BECKETT>What happened?

324
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,670
<11-10,CASTLE>将自己完全奉献给工作
<11-10,CASTLE>Dedication to his craft.

325
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,130
<11-11,ESPOSITO>就像《愤怒的公牛》里的罗伯特·德尼罗
<11-11,ESPOSITO>Like De Niro in "Raging Bull."

326
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,990
<11-12,BECKETT>扮演圣诞老人吗
<11-12,BECKETT>To be a Santa?

327
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,900
<11-13,ESPOSITO>我知道  差距太大了  还有你们更想不到的
<11-13,ESPOSITO>It's pretty extreme, I know, and I'll tell you this much,

328
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,560
<11-13,ESPOSITO>他去扮演圣诞老人不是为了赚钱
<11-13,ESPOSITO>he didn't go all Santa for the money.

329
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,020
<11-13,ESPOSITO>以前在公司的时候  他一年能挣50万
<11-13,ESPOSITO>Back in the day, he used to pull down a half a million a year.

330
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,930
<11-13,ESPOSITO>扮圣诞老人  只能挣到原来的十分之一
<11-13,ESPOSITO>As Santa, he made a tenth of that.

331
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,030
<11-14,RYAN>扮圣诞老人能挣那么多呀
<11-14,RYAN>You make that much as a Santa?

332
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,240
<11-14,RYAN>也许我也该换换工作了
<11-14,RYAN>Maybe I should switch jobs, huh?

333
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
<11-15,ESPOSITO>你想增重180斤然后搞一堆裹着脏尿布的
<11-15,ESPOSITO>What, gain 200 pounds and have a bunch of rug rats

334
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,850
<11-15,ESPOSITO>死小鬼坐在你腿上啊
<11-15,ESPOSITO>sitting on your lap with dirty diapers?

335
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,040
<11-16,RYAN>谢谢你描述的画面
<11-16,RYAN>Yeah, thanks for that visual.

336
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,460
<11-17,ESPOSITO>还有件事
<11-17,ESPOSITO>Oh, here's another thing.

337
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,470
<11-17,ESPOSITO>我查了一下艾德蒙德的账户
<11-17,ESPOSITO>I pulled Edmund's financials.

338
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,290
<11-17,ESPOSITO>被杀那天晚上
<11-17,ESPOSITO>On the night he was killed,

339
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,850
<11-17,ESPOSITO>他曾从自动取款机里提了2000块钱
<11-17,ESPOSITO>he withdrew 2 grand from his ATM.

340
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,650
<11-18,CASTLE>但尸体并没有携带任何现金
<11-18,CASTLE>He didn't have that money on him when we found him.

341
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,700
<11-18,CASTLE>他的钱包是空的
<11-18,CASTLE>His wallet was empty.

342
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,080
<11-19,BECKETT>好吧  去查查取款机的监视录像
<11-19,BECKETT>All right, take a look at the ATM footage

343
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,840
<11-19,BECKETT>看看有没有人跟他在一起
<11-19,BECKETT>and see if anyone was with him.

344
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,770
<11-19,BECKETT>他有可能遭抢了
<11-19,BECKETT>He might have been robbed.

345
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,370
<11-20,CASTLE>遇到强盗然后被发射上天吗
<11-20,CASTLE>Robbed and then launched into space?

346
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,290
<11-21,BECKETT>难道这个的可信度会比你的雪橇理论低
<11-21,BECKETT>And how is that less plausible than your sleigh?

347
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,420
<11-22,CASTLE>我认为你是在说"合理度"
<11-22,CASTLE>I think you mean less clausible.

348
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,490
<11-23,BECKETT>他的通话记录有线索吗
<11-23,BECKETT>What about his phone records?

349
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,090
<11-24,RYAN>给一个布鲁克林的律师打了一堆电话
<11-24,RYAN>Made a bunch of calls to some lawyer in Brooklyn.

350
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,390
<11-24,RYAN>但这条才是最有意思的
<11-24,RYAN>But here's the interesting one.

351
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,910
<11-24,RYAN>他的最后一个电话是打给前妻的
<11-24,RYAN>Last phone call he ever made was to his ex-wife.

352
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,280
<11-25,CASTLE>-圣诞婆婆   -格文·哈文
<11-25,CASTLE>- Mrs. Claus. - Gwenn Harwin.

353
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,890
<11-26,RYAN>我查了他长期的通话记录
<11-26,RYAN>I went back pretty far in his phone records.

354
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,360
<11-26,RYAN>至少在近三年内  他从没给她打过电话
<11-26,RYAN>He hasn't called her for at least three years.

355
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,690
<11-27,BECKETT>这么说  他取了2000块钱  致电前妻
<11-27,BECKETT>So he pulls out 2 grand, calls his ex-wife,

356
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,020
<11-27,BECKETT>几小时之后  被人发现已死亡
<11-27,BECKETT>and a couple of hours later, he ends up dead?

357
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,240
<11-27,BECKETT>传她来问话
<11-27,BECKETT>Let's bring her in.

358
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,970
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>他打电话来说想过来看看
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>He called me to say that he wanted to stop by.

359
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,440
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>非常奇怪
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>It was the strangest thing.

360
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,780
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>等他到了之后  我都认不出他来了
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>When he showed up, I didn't recognize him,

361
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,100
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>而现在  他就这么去了
<12-1,GWENN HARWIN>and now he's just... gone.

362
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,020
<12-2,BECKETT>很抱歉  哈文女士  但我必须问你
<12-2,BECKETT>I'm sorry to ask you this, Ms. Harwin,

363
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,970
<12-2,BECKETT>昨晚九点半你在哪里
<12-2,BECKETT>but where were you last night at 9:30?

364
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,690
<12-3,GWENN>没关系  我完全理解
<12-3,GWENN>That's quite all right. I understand.

365
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,590
<12-3,GWENN>当时我在主持一个食物银行的募捐活动
<12-3,GWENN>I was, uh, hosting a benefit for the food bank.

366
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,510
<12-4,BECKETT>艾德蒙德去找你是为了什么
<12-4,BECKETT>And why did Edmund come to see you?

367
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,900
<12-5,GWENN>为了道歉
<12-5,GWENN>To apologize.

368
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,450
<12-6,CASTLE>为什么要道歉
<12-6,CASTLE>Apologize for what?

369
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,620
<12-7,GWENN>为他离开家的方式道歉
<12-7,GWENN>For the way he walked out on our life.

370
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,880
<12-7,GWENN>我们曾经很和谐  至少我是这么想的
<12-7,GWENN>We were good together. At least, I thought we were.

371
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,450
<12-7,GWENN>十二年的婚姻
<12-7,GWENN>12 years of marriage,

372
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,880
<12-7,GWENN>一起创造的生活
<12-7,GWENN>of building a life together,

373
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,360
<12-7,GWENN>五年前的平安夜里
<12-7,GWENN>and then five years ago Christmas Eve,

374
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,250
<12-7,GWENN>我俩一起参加了一个派对  之后
<12-7,GWENN>we went to a party, and afterwards,

375
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,710
<12-7,GWENN>我们一起通宵观看《美妙人生》
<12-7,GWENN>we stayed up to watch "It's A Wonderful Life."

376
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,510
<12-7,GWENN>第二天一早  他就离开了
<12-7,GWENN>And the next morning, he left

377
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,620
<12-7,GWENN>穿上衣服就走
<12-7,GWENN>with just the shirt on his back

378
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,230
<12-7,GWENN>没有一句解释
<12-7,GWENN>and no explanation.

379
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,120
<12-8,BECKETT>但他为什么会选现在去看你
<12-8,BECKETT>But why would he visit you now?

380
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
<12-9,GWENN>他想让我知道  他为自己离开的方式
<12-9,GWENN>He wanted me to know how sorry he was

381
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,660
<12-9,GWENN>感到很抱歉  以防将来...
<12-9,GWENN>for the way he left in case...

382
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,590
<12-9,GWENN>他出什么事
<12-9,GWENN>anything happened to him.

383
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,700
<12-10,CASTLE>他那是什么意思
<12-10,CASTLE>What did he mean by that?

384
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,740
<12-11,GWENN>我也不知道
<12-11,GWENN>I don't know what he meant.

385
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,140
<12-11,GWENN>我根本不认识他了
<12-11,GWENN>I-I didn't even know who this man was.

386
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,720
<12-11,GWENN>他看起来很紧张  几乎随时可能崩溃
<12-11,GWENN>He seemed very nervous and very on edge.

387
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,730
<12-12,BECKETT>他有跟你暗示是什么事或人
<12-12,BECKETT>Did he give you any indication

388
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,050
<12-12,BECKETT>使他感到害怕
<12-12,BECKETT>of what he was afraid of

389
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,210
<12-12,BECKETT>或可能伤害他吗
<12-12,BECKETT>or who might have been after him?

390
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,150
<12-13,GWENN>他出门后  我在窗口
<12-13,GWENN>After he left, I went to the window

391
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,230
<12-13,GWENN>目送他上计程车
<12-13,GWENN>to watch him get into the cab.

392
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,750
<12-13,GWENN>车开走之后
<12-13,GWENN>And as the cab pulled away,

393
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,600
<12-13,GWENN>我看到一个骑摩托车的人在跟着他
<12-13,GWENN>there was a man on a motorcycle who was following him.

394
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,890
<12-14,BECKETT>我们需要你详细描述一下那辆摩托车
<12-14,BECKETT>We're gonna need you to give us a description of that motorcycle

395
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,540
<12-14,BECKETT>和骑车人
<12-14,BECKETT>along with its rider.

396
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,860
<13-1,ESPOSITO>提前要给珍妮的圣诞礼物吗
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Early Christmas present from Jenny?

397
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,500
<13-2,RYAN>算是吧  请你不要乱动好吗
<13-2,RYAN>Something like that. Would you mind not touching it?

398
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,370
<13-3,ESPOSITO>看呀看呀
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Well, well, well.

399
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,280
<13-3,ESPOSITO>这下我算是明白你跟珍妮
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Now I see what you and Jenny

400
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,430
<13-3,ESPOSITO>平安夜有什么计划了
<13-3,ESPOSITO>got planned for Christmas Eve.

401
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,510
<13-3,ESPOSITO>你们要忙上好一阵咯
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Y'all gon' be getting busy.

402
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,140
<13-4,ESPOSITO>吼  吼
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Ho! Ho!

403
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,010
<13-4,ESPOSITO>吼
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Ho!

404
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,300
<13-5,GATES>我会把你这个行为看作是为了破案的努力
<13-5,GATES>I take it this is your idea of working the Santa case?

405
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,790
<13-5,GATES>埃斯波西托警探
<13-5,GATES>Detective Esposito,

406
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,180
<13-5,GATES>你现在不是该在查自动取款机的监视录像吗
<13-5,GATES>you're supposed to be digging up that ATM footage.

407
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,240
<13-5,GATES>还有你
<13-5,GATES>And you are?

408
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,600
<13-6,RYAN>我该查死者常联系的那个律师的背景  长官
<13-6,RYAN>Chasing down that lawyer that our victim had been calling, Sir.

409
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,010
<13-7,GATES>好吧  别在这儿瞎闹了
<13-7,GATES>Okay, then. Let's finish up this hoochie-coochie thing

410
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,390
<13-7,GATES>快干活去
<13-7,GATES>and get on with it.

411
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,480
<13-8,ESPOSITO>遵命
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Yes, Sir.

412
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,280
<13-9,RYAN>被撞个正着
<13-9,RYAN>So busted.

413
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,670
<14-1,BECKETT>骑摩托车的人与艾德蒙德
<14-1,BECKETT>How does "guy on a motorcycle"

414
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,700
<14-1,BECKETT>在公园"着陆"有什么关联呢
<14-1,BECKETT>connect to Edmund landing in the park?

415
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,300
<14-2,CASTLE>没什么关联
<14-2,CASTLE>Nothing connects.

416
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,540
<14-2,CASTLE>为什么一个人之前还在看圣诞电影
<14-2,CASTLE>Why does a man watch a Christmas movie

417
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,810
<14-2,CASTLE>看完了就抛弃一切去扮圣诞老人了呢
<14-2,CASTLE>then walk out on everything to become a Santa?

418
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,970
<14-2,CASTLE>除非艾德蒙德事件的关键点就是
<14-2,CASTLE>Unless the key to Edmund's story

419
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,220
<14-2,CASTLE>《美妙人生》
<14-2,CASTLE>is "It's A Wonderful Life."

420
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,170
<14-2,CASTLE>你记不记得  影片中
<14-2,CASTLE>You remember, in the movie,

421
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,270
<14-2,CASTLE>乔治·贝里试图在平安夜自杀
<14-2,CASTLE>George Bailey tried to commit suicide on Christmas Eve

422
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,330
<14-2,CASTLE>然后有个天使救了他
<14-2,CASTLE>and was saved by an angel?

423
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,070
<14-3,BECKETT>在我们的事件里  这个天使就是大卫·邓恩
<14-3,BECKETT>Which in our story is David Dunne.

424
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,690
<14-4,CASTLE>这选角选得真奇怪
<14-4,CASTLE>Weird casting choice, I know,

425
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,670
<14-4,CASTLE>但如果艾德蒙德那时正想"摆脱现状"
<14-4,CASTLE>but what if Edmund was trying to jump off a metaphoric bridge,

426
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,000
<14-4,CASTLE>你懂的  就是重新开始
<14-4,CASTLE>you know, to start over?

427
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,790
<14-5,BECKETT>当圣诞老人吗
<14-5,BECKETT>As a Santa?

428
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,920
<14-5,BECKETT>是的
<14-5,BECKETT>Yes.

429
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,560
<14-6,CASTLE>没错  这确实不太说得通
<14-6,CASTLE>Yeah, that's where it falls apart.

430
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
<14-7,RYAN>事实上  艾德蒙德可不仅仅
<14-7,RYAN>Actually, it looks like Edmund was way more

431
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,200
<14-7,RYAN>是个圣诞老人
<14-7,RYAN>than just a Santa.

432
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,580
<14-7,RYAN>我终于查到
<14-7,RYAN>I finally got ahold of that lawyer

433
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,750
<14-7,RYAN>他常联系的那个律师了
<14-7,RYAN>that he'd been calling.

434
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,930
<14-7,RYAN>她代理卡伯特家对一间专放高利贷的公司
<14-7,RYAN>She'd actually filed a suit on behalf of his neighbors,

435
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,610
<14-7,RYAN>提出诉讼  那家公司叫日湾信贷
<14-7,RYAN>the Cabots, who'd lost their home to a predatory lender,

436
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,950
<14-7,RYAN>他们收走了卡伯特一家的房子
<14-7,RYAN>Sun Cove Funding.

437
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,890
<14-7,RYAN>起诉理由是一些非法交易
<14-7,RYAN>Something about illegal practices

438
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,810
<14-7,RYAN>和造假的文件
<14-7,RYAN>and forged documents.

439
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,060
<14-7,RYAN>总之是一次集体诉讼
<14-7,RYAN>Anyway, it's a class-action suit

440
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,890
<14-7,RYAN>代表43个家庭的利益  成败牵涉好几百万美元
<14-7,RYAN>representing 43 families with millions of dollars at stake.

441
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,750
<14-8,BECKETT>但为什么会是艾德蒙德给律师打电话呢
<14-8,BECKETT>But why was Edmund calling the lawyer?

442
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,490
<14-9,RYAN>她致力于意外事故案件
<14-9,RYAN>She had been working on contingency.

443
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,960
<14-9,RYAN>为了跟这个案子已经耗掉了大笔的钱
<14-9,RYAN>She's already lost tons of money

444
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,680
<14-9,RYAN>所以她想放弃诉讼
<14-9,RYAN>pressing the case, so she wanted to drop the suit.

445
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,220
<14-9,RYAN>但艾德蒙德求她不要放弃
<14-9,RYAN>But Edmund begged her not to.

446
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,840
<14-9,RYAN>事实上  他请她只要拖延几天
<14-9,RYAN>In fact, he asked her to hold off just a few days,

447
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,810
<14-9,RYAN>或许他就能力挽狂澜了
<14-9,RYAN>maybe he could turn things around.

448
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,480
<14-10,CASTLE>怎么做
<14-10,CASTLE>How?

449
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,660
<14-11,RYAN>他没说  但是她告诉他
<14-11,RYAN>Well, he didn't say, but she told him

450
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,080
<14-11,RYAN>唯一可以力挽狂澜的
<14-11,RYAN>the only thing that would turn things around

451
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,460
<14-11,RYAN>是两万五千美金的支票
<14-11,RYAN>was a check for 25 grand.

452
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,840
<14-12,BECKETT>对艾德蒙德要告的公司
<14-12,BECKETT>What do we know about this company

453
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,200
<14-12,BECKETT>我们了解多少
<14-12,BECKETT>that Edmund was up against?

454
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,050
<14-13,RYAN>日湾吗  就是个皮包公司
<14-13,RYAN>SunCove? It's a FLY-BY-NIGHT.

455
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,600
<14-13,RYAN>他们收了钱  然后就倒闭
<14-13,RYAN>They made their money, then they folded.

456
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,410
<14-13,RYAN>盖茨正好在证监会里有朋友
<14-13,RYAN>Gates actually has a friend at the S.E.C.

457
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,890
<14-13,RYAN>正在查关于他们的信息
<14-13,RYAN>Trying to dig up some information on them.

458
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,310
<14-14,BECKETT>你去联系一下诈骗调查组
<14-14,BECKETT>Can you check with the fraud division?

459
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,530
<14-14,BECKETT>看看他们对日湾了解多少
<14-14,BECKETT>See what they know about SunCove?

460
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,900
<14-15,RYAN>-明白  -谢谢
<14-15,RYAN>- Yeah. You got it. - Thanks.

461
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,730
<14-16,BECKETT>说到《美妙人生》
<14-16,BECKETT>Speaking of "It's a wonderful life,"

462
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,980
<14-17,CASTLE>我在想  明晚
<14-17,CASTLE>I was thinking, tomorrow night,

463
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,890
<14-17,CASTLE>我们可以搞个圣诞电影马拉松  或者
<14-17,CASTLE>perhaps we should have a christmas movie marathon or...

464
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,960
<14-17,CASTLE>来场让生活更美妙的马拉松
<14-17,CASTLE>some other kind of marathon that makes life wonderful.

465
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,490
<14-19,CASTLE>怎么了
<14-19,CASTLE>What?

466
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,880
<14-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我知道节日对你来说很重要
<14-20,BECKETT>Castle, look, I know how much the holidays mean to you

467
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,390
<14-20,BECKETT>我也知道你爱圣诞节
<14-20,BECKETT>and I know that you love Christmas,

468
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,310
<14-20,BECKETT>但我明天不能陪你了
<14-20,BECKETT>But I can't make it tomorrow.

469
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,730
<14-21,CASTLE>什么
<14-21,CASTLE>What?

470
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,240
<14-22,BECKETT>分局人手不够
<14-22,BECKETT>The precinct is short staffed,

471
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,710
<14-22,BECKETT>所以我得留下来工作
<14-22,BECKETT>so I'm gonna have to work.

472
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,900
<14-22,BECKETT>怎么  那个什么
<14-22,BECKETT>How--to--what--don't--

473
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
<14-23,CASTLE>这种差事不是应该新人做吗
<14-23,CASTLE>Don't...don't you have seniority?

474
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,550
<14-23,CASTLE>怎么会这样
<14-23,CASTLE>Don't...how... how can this happen?

475
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,590
<14-24,BECKETT>听着  我
<14-24,BECKETT>Look, I...

476
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,020
<14-24,BECKETT>我不能告诉盖茨
<14-24,BECKETT>I couldn't tell Gates.

477
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,900
<14-24,BECKETT>她不知道我们的事  好吗
<14-24,BECKETT>She doesn't know about us, okay?

478
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
<14-24,BECKETT>对不起  我知道你很失望
<14-24,BECKETT>So... look, I'm sorry. I know that you're disappointed.

479
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,160
<14-24,BECKETT>不  不
<14-24,BECKETT>No. Ah... no.

480
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,970
<14-25,CASTLE>这不是你的错  我懂的
<14-25,CASTLE>I...it's not your fault. I know.

481
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,320
<14-25,CASTLE>没事的  我...
<14-25,CASTLE>It's all...it's okay. I'm...

482
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,750
<14-25,CASTLE>我还是走吧  跟阿丽克西斯约好了
<14-25,CASTLE>I gotta get outta here anyway. I got a date with Alexis.

483
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,470
<14-25,CASTLE>一起去圣诞扫货
<14-25,CASTLE>Gonna do some christmas shopping.

484
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,970
<14-26,BECKETT>-玩得开心点  -好的
<14-26,BECKETT>- Okay, have fun. - Okay.

485
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,890
<14-28,BECKETT>-不用给我买东西了  -行
<14-28,BECKETT>- And don't get me anything. - Right.

486
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,310
<14-30,ESPOSITO>我从取款机的监控录像里找到了这个
<14-30,ESPOSITO>So, uh, I pulled this from the A.T.M. Footage.

487
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,260
<14-30,ESPOSITO>艾德蒙德取钱的时候是一个人
<14-30,ESPOSITO>Edmund was alone when he took out the cash,

488
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,890
<14-30,ESPOSITO>但他确实上了一辆出租车
<14-30,ESPOSITO>but he did get into a cab.

489
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,350
<14-31,BECKETT>知道他去哪了吗
<14-31,BECKETT>Any idea where he was going?

490
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,310
<14-32,ESPOSITO>我通过执照牌追踪到了他坐的出租车
<14-32,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I traced the taxi he used from the medallion.

491
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,740
<14-32,ESPOSITO>司机说他去了霍霍库斯机场
<14-32,ESPOSITO>Cabbie said that he took Edmund to Ho-Ho-Kus field.

492
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,030
<14-32,ESPOSITO>是新泽西的一家小型机场
<14-32,ESPOSITO>It's a small airfield out in Jersey.

493
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,190
<14-33,BECKETT>他是从那里起飞的吗
<14-33,BECKETT>Is that where he got on the plane?

494
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,290
<14-34,ESPOSITO>你觉得呢  但其实不是
<14-34,ESPOSITO>You'd think, but no.

495
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,060
<14-34,ESPOSITO>司机说
<14-34,ESPOSITO>The cabbie said that

496
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,830
<14-34,ESPOSITO>艾德蒙德让他稍等  自己要去跟别人碰头
<14-34,ESPOSITO>Edmund had him wait so he could go meet somebody,

497
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,840
<14-34,ESPOSITO>然后他回到车内  他们离开了机场
<14-34,ESPOSITO>then he got back in the cab, they left the airfield,

498
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,900
<14-34,ESPOSITO>后来他在长岛下了车
<14-34,ESPOSITO>and the cabbie dropped him off in Long Island city.

499
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,880
<14-34,ESPOSITO>这说不通啊
<14-34,ESPOSITO>That doesn't make any sense.

500
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,030
<14-35,BECKETT>如果他去了长岛  最后又怎么到了天上
<14-35,BECKETT>How'd he end up in the air if he went to Long Island city?

501
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,120
<14-36,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<14-36,ESPOSITO>I have no idea,

502
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,830
<14-36,ESPOSITO>不过跟他在机场碰头的人也许知道
<14-36,ESPOSITO>but the person he met with at the airfield might.

503
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,780
<14-36,ESPOSITO>那么说来
<14-36,ESPOSITO>So...

504
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,990
<15-1,ESPOSITO>你又要值圣诞班了
<15-1,ESPOSITO>You, uh, pulled the Christmas shift again?

505
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,650
<15-2,BECKETT>你不该在旁边偷听的
<15-2,BECKETT>You know, you shouldn't be eavesdropping, buddy.

506
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,850
<15-3,BECKETT>埃斯波  你看那是不是樱桃红
<15-3,BECKETT>Espo, does that look cherry red to you?

507
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,000
<15-4,ESPOSITO>是的
<15-4,ESPOSITO>It does.

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,510
<15-5,BECKETT>跟我们在艾德蒙德身上发现的掉漆一样
<15-5,BECKETT>Just like the paint chip we found on Edmund.

509
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,380
<15-6,BECKETT>锁被撬过了
<15-6,BECKETT>This lock's been tampered with.

510
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,220
<15-6,BECKETT>看起来是被强行打开的
<15-6,BECKETT>Looks like it was forced open.

511
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,340
<15-7,BECKETT>这里有没干的血迹
<15-7,BECKETT>There's fresh blood here.

512
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,150
<15-7,BECKETT>还有不少
<15-7,BECKETT>And lots of it.

513
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,720
<15-8,ESPOSITO>貌似我们找到犯罪现场了
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Looks like we just found our crime scene.

514
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
<15-8,ESPOSITO>是的
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

515
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,180
<16-1,ESPOSITO>血和艾德蒙德的吻合
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Well, it looks like the blood is a match to Edmund,

516
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,620
<16-1,ESPOSITO>但目前为止  没有找到指纹
<16-1,ESPOSITO>But so far, there are no prints.

517
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,180
<16-1,ESPOSITO>驾驶舱好像被清理过了
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Looks like the cockpit's been wiped.

518
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,430
<16-2,BECKETT>如果艾德蒙德从这里下车
<16-2,BECKETT>If Edmund came down here

519
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,840
<16-2,BECKETT>然后又回到长岛
<16-2,BECKETT>and then he went back to Long Island city,

520
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,050
<16-2,BECKETT>那他怎么会死在这架直升机里
<16-2,BECKETT>then how the hell did he end up in this chopper?

521
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,850
<16-3,ESPOSITO>不管谁跟他在一起  都脱不了干系
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Well, whoever was with him has gotta have the answer to that.

522
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,200
<16-4,BECKETT>我们从机主查起
<16-4,BECKETT>Let's start with who owns this thing.

523
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,230
<16-5,ESPOSITO>据机场管理员玛吉先生所说
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Well, according to the airfield manager, Mr. Mudge,

524
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,940
<16-5,ESPOSITO>它属于一个叫查克·埃姆斯的人
<16-5,ESPOSITO>It belongs to a Chuck Ames,

525
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,660
<16-5,ESPOSITO>但他正在夏威夷度假
<16-5,ESPOSITO>But he's on vacation in hawaii.

526
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,990
<16-6,BECKETT>你好  玛吉先生
<16-6,BECKETT>Hi, Mr. Mudge.

528
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,070
<16-6,BECKETT>谁还有授权  能开那架飞机
<16-6,BECKETT>Now is anyone else authorized to fly that bird?

529
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,240
<16-6,BECKETT>据我所知没有
<16-6,BECKETT>Not that I'm aware of.

530
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,150
<16-7,ESPOSITO>貌似谁都能
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Looks like just about anybody

531
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,750
<16-7,ESPOSITO>进入这个机场
<16-7,ESPOSITO>can have access to this airfield.

532
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,110
<16-7,ESPOSITO>没有检查关卡  没有监控探头
<16-7,ESPOSITO>There's no checkpoints, no cameras.

533
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,400
<16-7,ESPOSITO>在此之前我们根本不需要
<16-7,ESPOSITO>We never needed any till now.

534
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,690
<16-8,ESPOSITO>关键是  如果有人上了这架飞机
<16-8,ESPOSITO>The point is, if someone did get on to this property,

535
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,670
<16-8,ESPOSITO>要把它开走有多难
<16-8,ESPOSITO>how hard would it be for them to fly that chopper outta here?

536
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,620
<16-8,ESPOSITO>任何有飞行执照的人都能开
<16-8,ESPOSITO>Anybody with a helicopter rating could take it up.

537
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,840
<17-1,RYAN>R-44很容易驾驭
<17-1,RYAN>R-44 is easy.

538
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,380
<16-8,ESPOSITO>甚至都不需要钥匙
<16-8,ESPOSITO>You don't even need a key to start it.

539
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,460
<16-9,BECKETT>我们在找一个
<16-9,BECKETT>So then we're looking for someone

540
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,170
<16-9,BECKETT>熟悉这个机场内部的人
<16-9,BECKETT>that knew the ins and outs of this airport

541
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,190
<16-9,BECKETT>这个人知道直升机在这里
<16-9,BECKETT>Along with the fact that that chopper was gonna be here.

542
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,230
<16-10,ESPOSITO>这个人甚至知道查克·埃姆斯
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Maybe even someone who knew

543
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,800
<16-10,ESPOSITO>在夏威夷
<16-10,ESPOSITO>that Chuck Ames was gonna be in hawaii.

544
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,190
<16-11,BECKETT>我们需要埃姆斯先生的联系方式
<16-11,BECKETT>We're gonna need Mr. Ames' contact info

545
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,840
<16-11,BECKETT>还有你们所有员工的资料
<16-11,BECKETT>along with the names of all of your employees

546
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,410
<16-11,BECKETT>还有去年所有在这里飞行过的人
<16-11,BECKETT>and everyone who's flown through here in the past year.

547
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,690
<16-11,BECKETT>我还有圣诞彩灯要挂
<16-11,BECKETT>Hey, I-I got Christmas lights to hang.

548
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,290
<16-12,BECKETT>知道  我们还有凶案要破
<16-12,BECKETT>Yeah, and we have a murder to solve.

549
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,730
<16-12,BECKETT>能不能知道
<16-12,BECKETT>Now is there any way to know

550
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,360
<16-12,BECKETT>直升机昨晚在哪飞
<16-12,BECKETT>where the chopper flew last night?

551
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,380
<16-12,BECKETT>有没有飞行记录  GPS系统
<16-12,BECKETT>Is there a flight recorder, GPS system?

552
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,510
<16-12,BECKETT>再说一遍  它是架低端直升机
<16-12,BECKETT>Again, she's a low-tech bird.

553
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,000
<16-13,BECKETT>你们有燃耗记录吗
<16-13,BECKETT>Do you have a record of the fuel that was in the tank?

554
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,390
<16-13,BECKETT>燃料记录显示是满的
<16-13,BECKETT>Fuel log says it was full.

555
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,610
<17-1,RYAN>我们可以通过燃油消耗量
<17-1,RYAN>We can figure out how far the chopper flew

556
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,180
<17-1,RYAN>推知直升机飞行了多远
<17-1,RYAN>by how much fuel was used.

557
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,480
<17-1,RYAN>油箱里少了五分之一的油
<17-1,RYAN>It was down about a fifth of a tank.

558
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,810
<17-1,RYAN>R-44耗油约
<17-1,RYAN>The R-44 burns about

559
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,100
<17-1,RYAN>四或五英里每加仑
<17-1,RYAN>4 or 5 miles per gallon,

560
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,990
<17-1,RYAN>所以它飞了大概45英里
<17-1,RYAN>so it flew about 45 miles.

561
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,940
<17-2,BECKETT>差不多就是
<17-2,BECKETT>That's almost exactly

562
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,080
<17-2,BECKETT>这里到长岛一个来回的距离
<17-2,BECKETT>how far it is to Long Island city and back.

563
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,990
<17-3,RYAN>艾德蒙德在那里下了出租车
<17-3,RYAN>Edmund took the cab there

564
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,360
<17-3,RYAN>然后上了直升机
<17-3,RYAN>and must have gotten in that chopper.

565
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,810
<17-4,BECKETT>好的  我们去查一下长岛
<17-4,BECKETT>Okay, let's check all the heliports

566
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,550
<17-4,BECKETT>所有的停机坪  找出是在哪儿降落的
<17-4,BECKETT>In Long Island city and find out where.

567
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,220
<18-1,CASTLE>我是说  圣诞老人被杀已经够糟的了
<18-1,CASTLE>I mean, it's bad enough Santa has been murdered.

568
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,910
<18-1,CASTLE>这还将是18年来
<18-1,CASTLE>This will be the first Christmas Eve

569
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,990
<18-1,CASTLE>我们不在一起过的第一个圣诞夜
<18-1,CASTLE>In 18 years we haven't spent together.

570
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,740
<18-1,CASTLE>这开启了一个糟糕的先例
<18-1,CASTLE>I mean, it sets a grim precedent.

571
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,940
<18-2,ALEXIS>老爸  你说得太夸张了
<18-2,ALEXIS>Dad, you're being dramatic.

572
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,270
<18-3,CASTLE>你随时都可以见朋友啊
<18-3,CASTLE>Well, you can see your friends anytime.

573
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,330
<18-4,ALEXIS>如果只是"一个"朋友呢
<18-4,ALEXIS>Well... what if it's just one person,

574
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,110
<18-4,ALEXIS>而且他其实不是"朋友"
<18-4,ALEXIS>and he's not really a friend?

575
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,070
<18-5,CASTLE>新男友  好吧
<18-5,CASTLE>Oh, a new guy. Okay.

576
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,790
<18-5,CASTLE>那么
<18-5,CASTLE>Well, does this, uh,

577
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,730
<18-5,CASTLE>那"一个"不是"朋友"的人叫啥
<18-5,CASTLE>Non-plural non-friend have a name?

578
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,110
<18-7,CASTLE>-他叫麦克斯  -麦克斯
<18-7,CASTLE>- It's max. - Max.

579
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,900
<18-8,ALEXIS>我在年度烂诗比赛上遇到他的
<18-8,ALEXIS>I met him at the annual bad poetry contest

580
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,040
<18-8,ALEXIS>就在感恩节前
<18-8,ALEXIS>right before Thanksgiving.

581

<18-9,CASTLE>Well, bring him along. I would love to meet this bad poet.

583
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,530
<18-10,ALEXIS>-平安夜来见家长  -是啊
<18-10,ALEXIS>- Uh, y--meet my dad on Christmas Eve? - Yeah.

584
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,780
<18-12,ALEXIS>这样压力太大了
<18-12,ALEXIS>Tha-that's way too much pressure.

585
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,250
<18-13,CASTLE>有什么压力  吃吃喝喝  高高兴兴吗
<18-13,CASTLE>What pr--pressure to what, eat, drink, and be merry?

586
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:32,810
<18-13,CASTLE>这会...
<18-13,CASTLE>It'll be--

587
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,230
<18-14,ALEXIS>圣诞节当天麦克斯要和家人去伦敦
<18-14,ALEXIS>Max is going to London with his family on Christmas day.

588
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,390
<18-14,ALEXIS>假期结束我才能见到他
<18-14,ALEXIS>I won't get to see him till after break.

589
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,310
<18-14,ALEXIS>我们就想去公园溜冰
<18-14,ALEXIS>We just want to go ice skating in the park.

590

<18-15,CASTLE>Have a great time.

592
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,700
<18-16,ALEXIS>再说你要和贝克特一起过嘛
<18-16,ALEXIS>Besides, you'll be with Beckett.

593
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,230
<18-17,CASTLE>对
<18-17,CASTLE>Right.

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,280
<19-4,GATES>对不起
<19-4,GATES>Oh, I-I'm sorry.

603
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,460
<19-4,GATES>我没为你准备礼物
<19-4,GATES>I don't have anything for you.

604
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,900
<19-5,CASTLE>每天能来这里就是你给我的礼物了
<19-5,CASTLE>Please. Just being here each day is gift.

605
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,380
<19-5,CASTLE>我想让你知道  我万分感谢
<19-5,CASTLE>I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate

606
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,280
<19-5,CASTLE>你们所做的一切
<19-5,CASTLE>all that you do,

607
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,160
<19-5,CASTLE>你和贝克特探长
<19-5,CASTLE>you and detective Beckett.

608
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,630
<19-6,GATES>卡塞尔先生  我要去郊区
<19-6,GATES>Mr. Castle, I am on my way uptown

609
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,870
<19-6,GATES>见我的婆婆
<19-6,GATES>to meet my mother-in-law

610
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,520
<19-6,GATES>和她一起喝茶  吃那些小小的可怕的三明治
<19-6,GATES>to have tea and eat those tiny freakin' sandwiches.

611
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,440
<19-6,GATES>所以不如你直说你到底打什么注意吧
<19-6,GATES>So why don't you just say what's on your mind?

612
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,910
<19-7,CASTLE>我就是很担心贝克特探长
<19-7,CASTLE>I'm just so worried about detective Beckett.

613
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,740
<19-7,CASTLE>她工作太努力了
<19-7,CASTLE>I mean, she works so hard.

614
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,700
<19-7,CASTLE>你不觉得她应该享受假期吗
<19-7,CASTLE>Don't you think she deserves a little holiday?

615
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,960
<19-7,CASTLE>难道没有其他人可以帮她顶上
<19-7,CASTLE>Isn't there someone else who could take

616
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,930
<19-7,CASTLE>平安夜的班吗
<19-7,CASTLE>that Christmas Eve shift?

617
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,260
<19-8,GATES>首先  我怎么安排人手
<19-8,GATES>First of all, how I schedule my people

618
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,650
<19-8,GATES>和你没关系
<19-8,GATES>is not your concern.

619
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,700
<19-8,GATES>不过话说回来
<19-8,GATES>And having said that,

620
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,330
<19-8,GATES>贝克特探长自愿要上这轮班
<19-8,GATES>detective Beckett volunteered to take the shift.

621
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,010
<19-9,CASTLE>她什么时候要求的
<19-9,CASTLE>When did she do that?

622
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,810
<19-10,GATES>今天早些时候
<19-10,GATES>Earlier today.

623
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,180
<19-10,GATES>她来找我  要求帮埃尔丁警探代班
<19-10,GATES>She came to me and asked to take Detective Eldin's shift.

624
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,580
<19-10,GATES>他结婚了  但她没有
<19-10,GATES>He has a family, and she doesn't.

625
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,030
<19-11,CASTLE>那好吧
<19-11,CASTLE>Okay, then.

626
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,120
<19-11,CASTLE>问题解决
<19-11,CASTLE>Problem solved.

627
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,310
<20-1,BECKETT>好  这样就将范围缩小到了长岛
<20-1,BECKETT>Okay, so that narrows it down to five heliports

628
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,620
<20-1,BECKETT>五个直升机停机坪
<20-1,BECKETT>in Long Island City.

629
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,970
<20-2,RYAN>一个是警局  一个是医院
<20-2,RYAN>One is a police station. One's a hospital.

630
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,040
<20-2,RYAN>这两处都有监控  排除后就只有公司大楼的
<20-2,RYAN>They'd both be monitored, so that leaves helipads at

631
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,400
<20-2,RYAN>直升机停机坪了
<20-2,RYAN>bankcorp building,

632
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,440
<20-2,RYAN>一处是西部酒店  凯斯商务大楼
<20-2,RYAN>one West Hotel, and Case Commerce Building.

633
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,100
<20-2,RYAN>凯斯商务  CC
<20-2,RYAN>Case Commerce... C.C.

634
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,720
<20-3,BECKETT>拐杖糖
<20-3,BECKETT>The candy canes.

635
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,820
<21-4,BECKETT>凯斯商务  CC
<21-4,BECKETT>Case Commerce. C.C.

636
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,530
<20-3,BECKETT>那就是艾德蒙德死前去的地方
<20-3,BECKETT>That's where Edmund was.

637
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,100
<20-3,BECKETT>我们去查清楚吧
<20-3,BECKETT>Let's find out why.

638
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,600
<20-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<20-4,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

639
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,540
<20-4,BECKETT>你一起来吗
<20-4,BECKETT>You coming?

640
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,400
<20-5,CASTLE>当然
<20-5,CASTLE>Yeah, sure.

641
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,160
<21-1,CASTLE>你逃不掉的
<21-1,CASTLE>Oh, you can't escape it.

642
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,040
<21-1,CASTLE>到处都是圣诞气氛
<21-1,CASTLE>Christmas is everywhere.

643
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,790
<21-1,CASTLE>想过个开心的节日压力好大
<21-1,CASTLE>So much pressure to have a good time.

644
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,050
<21-2,BECKETT>你还好吧
<21-2,BECKETT>Are you okay?

645
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,050
<21-3,CASTLE>我能有啥不好的
<21-3,CASTLE>Why wouldn't I be?

646
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,820
<21-4,BECKETT>凯斯商务  到了
<21-4,BECKETT>Case Commerce. There it is.

647
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,020
<21-5,BECKETT>你好  这里怎么了
<21-5,BECKETT>Hi. Wait, uh, what's going on here?

648
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,790
<21-6,UNIFORM>貌似在昨晚的办公室圣诞派对上发生了
<21-6,UNIFORM>Looks like a heist occurred at the office Christmas party

649
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,400
<21-6,UNIFORM>-抢劫  -抢劫
<21-6,UNIFORM>- last night. - A heist?

650
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>直到今天早上
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>Well, I-I didn't notice

651
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,330
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>我才发现有东西失踪了
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>anything was missing until this morning.

652
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,630
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>随后我就打电话报警了
<21-8,DENISE MCKAY>And that's when I called you people.

653
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:56,110
<21-9,CASTLE>昨晚的派对上你不会碰巧请了圣诞老人吧
<21-9,CASTLE>You didn't happen to have a Santa working your party, did you?

654
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,050
<21-10,DENISE>是啊  我们请了
<21-10,DENISE>Yes, we did.

655
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,860
<21-11,BECKETT>他看起来是这样吗
<21-11,BECKETT>Did he look like this?

656
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,310
<21-11,BECKETT>是的
<21-11,BECKETT>Yes.

657
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,230
<21-12,DENISE>他就是我们的圣诞老人  怎么了
<21-12,DENISE>He was our Santa. Why?

658
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,300
<21-13,CASTLE>看来我们的圣诞老人很淘气啊
<21-13,CASTLE>Looks like our Santa was a little more naughty than nice.

659
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,780
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>没有  昨晚我是第一次见到他
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>No, I never saw him before last night.

660
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,730
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>我也没意识到他偷了东西
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>And I wasn't aware he'd stolen anything.

661
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,300
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>但是鉴于我们的工作
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>But given what we do here,

662
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,580
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>我想这还不算是最糟糕的
<22-1,MICHAEL CASE>I suppose it could've been a lot worse.

663
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,090
<22-2,BECKETT>凯斯先生  你的公司是做什么的
<22-2,BECKETT>And what is it that your company does, Mr. Case?

664
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,790
<22-3,CASE>投资服务  主要是资产管理
<22-3,CASE>Investment services. Asset management mostly.

665
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,360
<22-3,CASE>考虑到我们有许多客户和账户的信息
<22-3,CASE>Given the amount of client and account information,

666
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,710
<22-3,CASE>对身份窃贼来说我们可是一座金矿
<22-3,CASE>we'd be a gold mine for identity thieves.

667
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,570
<22-3,CASE>但是这些系统没有被动过
<22-3,CASE>None of those systems were touched.

668
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,960
<22-4,CASTLE>那他们偷了什么呢
<22-4,CASTLE>So what did they steal?

669
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,530
<22-5,DENISE>他后面办公室里的一个钟
<22-5,DENISE>A clock from his office in back.

670
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,610
<22-6,BECKETT>抱歉  你说的是"钟"
<22-6,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Did you just say "Clock"?

671
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,770
<22-7,CASE>探长  那可不是随便的一个钟
<22-7,CASE>Not just any clock, Detective.

672
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,070
<22-7,CASE>托马斯·蒂莱吉早期作品
<22-7,CASE>An early Tomas Tilledge.

673
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,420
<22-8,CASTLE>复兴时期的传奇钟表匠
<22-8,CASTLE>Legendary clockmaker from the Restoration period.

674
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,670
<22-8,CASTLE>一定非常值钱吧
<22-8,CASTLE>That must have been worth a great deal.

675
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,140
<22-9,CASE>估值为三万美金
<22-9,CASE>I had it appraised at $30,000.

676
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,750
<22-10,CASTLE>多大的钟
<22-10,CASTLE>Wow. How big was it?

677
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,210
<22-11,CASE>差不多这么大
<22-11,CASE>It's about this size.

678
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,760
<22-12,CASTLE>很小  能装进他的麻袋里
<22-12,CASTLE>Small enough to fit in his sack.

679
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,830
<22-13,CASE>你知道  很难相信我的客人中
<22-13,CASE>You know, it's hard enough imagining

680
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,550
<22-13,CASE>会有人是小偷  但是圣诞老人
<22-13,CASE>one of my guests being a thief, but Santa?

681
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,280
<22-14,BECKETT>你确定没有其他东西失踪吗
<22-14,BECKETT>Are you sure that nothing else is missing?

682
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,270
<22-15,CASE>确定  怎么了
<22-15,CASE>Positive. Why?

683
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,620
<22-16,BECKETT>因为我们有证据表明你的圣诞老人
<22-16,BECKETT>Well, because our evidence suggests that your Santa

684
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,500
<22-16,BECKETT>是乘着停在你们停机坪的直升飞机离开的
<22-16,BECKETT>left by helicopter, which was waiting on your helipad.

685
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,880
<22-17,DENISE>他为什么要乘直升飞机
<22-17,DENISE>Why would he take a helicopter?

686
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
<22-18,CASTLE>你们在派对上没听到什么声音吗
<22-18,CASTLE>You didn't hear anything from the party?

687
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,000
<22-19,CASE>没有  但是音乐声很大
<22-19,CASE>No, but the music was loud,

688
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,480
<22-19,CASE>而且后壁是隔音的
<22-19,CASE>and the back wall is soundproofed.

689
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720
<22-20,BECKETT>那个钟还有什么特别之处吗
<22-20,BECKETT>Was there anything else that was special about this clock?

690
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,130
<22-21,CASE>据我所知是没有
<22-21,CASE>Not that I'm aware of.

691
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,450
<22-22,BECKETT>我会让一名警探
<22-22,BECKETT>Okay, I'm gonna get one of my detectives

692
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,190
<22-22,BECKETT>过来和你的员工谈谈
<22-22,BECKETT>to come down and interview your staff.

693
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,850
<22-22,BECKETT>同时  能给我一份
<22-22,BECKETT>In the meantime, could I have a list

694
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,260
<22-22,BECKETT>出席派对的名单吗
<22-22,BECKETT>of all of the party attendees?

695
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,680
<22-24,DENISE>-好  -当然可以
<22-24,DENISE>- Sure. - Of course.

696
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,110
<22-25,BECKETT>我们也需要电梯监控录像
<22-25,BECKETT>We'll also pull elevator footage

697
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,130
<22-25,BECKETT>以防有未受邀请的客人参加
<22-25,BECKETT>to make sure that there weren't any uninvited guests.

698
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,350
<22-25,BECKETT>三万
<22-25,BECKETT>$30,000.

699
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,580
<23-1,CASTLE>仅比卡伯特一家需要的诉讼费多一点而已
<23-1,CASTLE>That's a little more than the Cabots needed for their lawsuit.

700
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,270
<23-1,CASTLE>也许我们的圣诞老人是个罗宾汉
<23-1,CASTLE>Maybe our Santa is Robin Hood,

701
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,130
<23-1,CASTLE>劫富济贫
<23-1,CASTLE>stealing from the rich to give to the poor?

702
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,040
<23-2,BECKETT>但是他为什么要用直升飞机偷这个呢
<23-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but why would he use a helicopter to steal this?

703
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,400
<23-2,BECKETT>他本可以把它塞进麻袋里
<23-2,BECKETT>I mean, he could've just stuffed it in his sack

704
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,100
<23-2,BECKETT>然后笑呵呵地离开那里
<23-2,BECKETT>and ho-ho-ho'ed outta there.

705
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,330
<23-2,BECKETT>一定不仅仅是因为钟的关系
<23-2,BECKETT>It has to be about more than just the clock.

706
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,530
<23-3,CASTLE>在他的工作台后面还有一些钟
<23-3,CASTLE>Well, there were a couple more clocks on his workbench.

707
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,010
<23-3,CASTLE>也许这一个有什么特别意义
<23-3,CASTLE>Maybe this one's significant somehow.

708
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,620
<23-4,BECKETT>好吧  你的理论是什么
<23-4,BECKETT>Okay. What's your theory?

709
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,610
<23-5,CASTLE>里面有藏宝图
<23-5,CASTLE>Uh... treasure map inside.

710
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,530
<23-5,CASTLE>不对
<23-5,CASTLE>No.

711
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,910
<23-5,CASTLE>不对  这个钟是被一个秘密组织用来
<23-5,CASTLE>No. The clock was commissioned by a secret society

712
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,650
<23-5,CASTLE>倒数世界末日的
<23-5,CASTLE>to count down the end of days--

713
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,550
<23-5,CASTLE>一个由圣诞老人组成的秘密组织
<23-5,CASTLE>A secret society of Santas,

714
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,050
<23-5,CASTLE>他们守护着时间
<23-5,CASTLE>who are the guardians of time.

715
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,360
<23-6,BECKETT>这想法太拉风了
<23-6,BECKETT>Oh, that's good.

716
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,970
<23-6,BECKETT>先不管直升飞机之谜
<23-6,BECKETT>Okay, putting aside the mystery of the helicopter,

717
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,900
<23-6,BECKETT>假设这跟钟有关
<23-6,BECKETT>let's say it is about the clock.

718
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,170
<23-6,BECKETT>艾德蒙德是怎么知道的
<23-6,BECKETT>How did Edmund know about it?

719
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,800
<23-6,BECKETT>办公室里没人认识他
<23-6,BECKETT>Nobody from the office recognized him.

720
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,260
<23-7,CASTLE>也许他之前办过派对
<23-7,CASTLE>Well, maybe he had worked the party before.

721
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,980
<23-8,ESPOSITO>抱歉  老兄  我查过了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Sorry, bro. I checked.

722
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,670
<23-8,ESPOSITO>他没有
<23-8,ESPOSITO>He hasn't,

723
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,160
<23-8,ESPOSITO>但他绝对打算今年去
<23-8,ESPOSITO>but he sure was determined to work it this year.

724
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,280
<23-8,ESPOSITO>那家机构预约了另外一个圣诞老人
<23-8,ESPOSITO>The agency had booked another Santa to work that party,

725
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,180
<23-8,ESPOSITO>但凯斯商务中有人
<23-8,ESPOSITO>But someone from case commerce

726
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,770
<23-8,ESPOSITO>一周前打电话取消了预约
<23-8,ESPOSITO>called about a week ago to cancel.

727
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,710
<23-9,BECKETT>让我猜猜  不是凯斯公司的人打的电话
<23-9,BECKETT>Let me guess. No one actually called from case.

728
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,320
<23-10,ESPOSITO>-正解  -当他到达的时候
<23-10,ESPOSITO>- Ding ding. - And when he arrived,

729
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,540
<23-11,CASTLE>他们以为他就是受雇的圣诞老人
<23-11,CASTLE>they assumed he was the Santa they'd hired.

730
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,320
<23-12,ESPOSITO>真是高明的诡计啊
<23-12,ESPOSITO>Kind of a brilliant scam, really.

731
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,660
<23-12,ESPOSITO>你可以进入上层家庭和高级企业
<23-12,ESPOSITO>You have access to high-end homes and businesses,

732
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,190
<23-12,ESPOSITO>再说谁会怀疑圣诞老人呢
<23-12,ESPOSITO>and who's gonna distrust Santa?

733
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,910
<23-13,CASTLE>显然  他的同伴们就会
<23-13,CASTLE>Uh, his partners, apparently.

734
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,200
<23-13,CASTLE>盗亦无道  即使是"圣盗"
<23-13,CASTLE>No honor among thieves, even Santa thieves.

735
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,430
<23-14,BECKETT>让劫案科把那张照片发到当铺
<23-14,BECKETT>All right. Have robbery send that photo to pawnshops

736
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,420
<23-14,BECKETT>和各大拍卖行
<23-14,BECKETT>and auction houses.

737
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,590
<23-14,BECKETT>如果他的同伴想兑换成现金  立刻通知我
<23-14,BECKETT>If his partners try to cash in, I want to know.

738
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,810
<23-15,ESPOSITO>好的
<23-15,ESPOSITO>Absolutely.

739
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,310
<24-1,BECKETT>一个人抛弃自己的生活和高新职位
<24-1,BECKETT>A man leaves his life and a high-paying job

740
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,670
<24-1,BECKETT>成为邻里间的老好人
<24-1,BECKETT>to become the neighborhood saint

741
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:50,460
<24-1,BECKETT>结果却因盗窃一个钟而被枪杀
<24-1,BECKETT>only to get shot dead after stealing a clock

742
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,000
<24-1,BECKETT>那钟还不如随便一辆车值钱
<24-1,BECKETT>that's worth less than your average car,

743
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,110
<24-1,BECKETT>然后他又被扔出直升机
<24-1,BECKETT>and then he gets thrown out of a helicopter

744
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,910
<24-1,BECKETT>而他最开始根本就不需要上那架直升机
<24-1,BECKETT>that he didn't even need to be in in the first place.

745
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,020
<24-1,BECKETT>完全说不通嘛
<24-1,BECKETT>It makes no sense.

746
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,130
<24-1,BECKETT>鉴于我们手中对那家伙的全部信息
<24-1,BECKETT>Given everything that we know about this guy,

747
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,170
<24-1,BECKETT>整件事都与他的为人完全不符
<24-1,BECKETT>this is completely out of character.

748
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,700
<24-2,CASTLE>有时候人就是会做一些让外人难以理解的事
<24-2,CASTLE>Well, sometimes people do inexplicable things.

749
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,370
<24-3,BECKETT>任何事都是有缘由的
<24-3,BECKETT>There's an explanation for everything.

750
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,800
<24-3,BECKETT>是吗
<24-3,BECKETT>Is there?

751
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,600
<24-4,CASTLE>你主动要求替埃尔丁值班
<24-4,CASTLE>You volunteered to take Eldin's shift.

752
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,240
<24-4,CASTLE>别找理由
<24-4,CASTLE>Don't pretend.

753
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
<24-4,CASTLE>如果你还没准备好  为什么不直接告诉我
<24-4,CASTLE>If you aren't ready, why not just tell me?

754
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,750
<24-5,BECKETT>我很抱歉  卡塞尔  我不是有意...
<24-5,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Castle. I didn't mean to--

755
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,580
<24-6,CASTLE>你不是有意什么
<24-6,CASTLE>You didn't mean to what?

756
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,040
<24-7,BECKETT>圣诞节对我和对你的意义完全不一样
<24-7,BECKETT>Christmas means something different to me than it does to you.

757
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,660
<24-8,CASTLE>都是圣诞节嘛  能有多不一样
<24-8,CASTLE>It's Christmas. I mean, how can it be different?

758
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,700
<24-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  每年冬天  一旦寒冷袭来
<24-9,BECKETT>Castle, every winter, as soon as that chill rolls in,

759
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,110
<24-9,BECKETT>我就仿佛又置身于那条小巷
<24-9,BECKETT>I am right back there in that alley.

760
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,830
<24-9,BECKETT>到1月9日  我们却仍未摘下
<24-9,BECKETT>January 9th, and we still haven't taken

761
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,990
<24-9,BECKETT>圣诞节的各种装饰品
<24-9,BECKETT>our Christmas decorations down.

762
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,660
<24-9,BECKETT>等我和我爸终于摘下来的时候
<24-9,BECKETT>And by the time my dad and I did,

763
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,690
<24-9,BECKETT>就好像我们把圣诞节永远封存了
<24-9,BECKETT>it was like we were putting Christmas away forever.

764
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,290
<24-9,BECKETT>我们自那之后再没打开过那些盒子
<24-9,BECKETT>We haven't opened those boxes since.

765
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,660
<24-10,CASTLE>我不知道
<24-10,CASTLE>I didn't know.

766
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,050
<24-11,BECKETT>所以  每一年我爸都会去他的小木屋
<24-11,BECKETT>That's why, every year, my dad goes up to his cabin,

767
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,080
<24-11,BECKETT>自从我当上了警察开始
<24-11,BECKETT>and ever since I became a rookie,

768
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,280
<24-11,BECKETT>我一直都要求在圣诞节当天值班
<24-11,BECKETT>I have taken the Christmas shift,

769
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,290
<24-11,BECKETT>因为我知道有很多家庭
<24-11,BECKETT>because I know that there are families out there

770
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,270
<24-11,BECKETT>都在合家团聚  一起庆祝节日
<24-11,BECKETT>that are celebrating together in their homes,

771
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,160
<24-11,BECKETT>我要一直守护着  那就是我的节日传统
<24-11,BECKETT>and I am keeping watch, and that is my tradition.

772
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,660
<24-11,BECKETT>而且那对我很重要
<24-11,BECKETT>And that is important to me.

773
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,300
<24-11,BECKETT>就跟你的节日传统对你很重要一样
<24-11,BECKETT>It's as important as your tradition is to you.

774
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,400
<24-11,BECKETT>我很抱歉  卡塞尔
<24-11,BECKETT>And I'm sorry, Castle.

775
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,500
<24-11,BECKETT>我之前以为我可以放下这一切
<24-11,BECKETT>I thought I could let that go,

776
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,740
<24-11,BECKETT>但我...
<24-11,BECKETT>But I...

777
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,760
<24-12,CASTLE>我理解
<24-12,CASTLE>I understand.

779
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,950
<24-14,RYAN>听着  我找到一个管理员
<24-14,RYAN>Yeah, so I got a custodian

780
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,070
<24-14,RYAN>他昨晚上屋顶抽烟
<24-14,RYAN>who was up on the roof last night for a smoke.

781
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,280
<24-15,BECKETT>他看见什么了吗
<24-15,BECKETT>Did he see anything?

782
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,310
<24-16,RYAN>不是他看到什么  而是他发现了什么
<24-16,RYAN>Well, it's not what he saw. It's what he found.

783
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,570
<24-16,RYAN>那地方之前曾被清扫过
<24-16,RYAN>The place was cleaned earlier in the day,

784
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,420
<24-16,RYAN>但当他上去的时候
<24-16,RYAN>but when he got up there,

785
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,140
<24-16,RYAN>发现直升机场到处都是垃圾
<24-16,RYAN>there was trash blown all over the helipad,

786
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,260
<24-16,RYAN>可能是直升机起飞时机翼转动带起来的
<24-16,RYAN>probably from the rotor wash when it took off.

787
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,550
<24-17,BECKETT>什么样的垃圾
<24-17,BECKETT>What kind of trash?

788
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,960
<24-18,RYAN>像是等人时留下的
<24-18,RYAN>The kind that looked like someone had been waiting for someone,

789
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,620
<24-18,RYAN>饮料罐  糖果纸
<24-18,RYAN>Soda can, candy wrappers,

790
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,000
<24-18,RYAN>以及一包空的斗烟叶盒
<24-18,RYAN>And an empty pouch of pipe tobacco.

791
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,050
<24-19,BECKETT>斗烟叶
<24-19,BECKETT>Pipe tobacco?

792
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,870
<24-20,CASTLE>我们知道有谁
<24-20,CASTLE>Now who do we know

793
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,320
<24-20,CASTLE>既用烟斗  又驾驶直升机的呢
<24-20,CASTLE>that smokes a pipe and flies?

794
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,580
<24-20,CASTLE>记住
<24-20,CASTLE>And remember,

795
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,720
<25-1,DUNNE>当你们出去工作的时候
<25-1,DUNNE>when you go out there,

796
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,340
<25-1,DUNNE>圣诞老人不是从烟囱进入人们的家里
<25-1,DUNNE>Santa does not enter through the chimney.

797
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,810
<25-1,DUNNE>而是进入人们的心里
<25-1,DUNNE>He enters through the heart.

798
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,860
<25-2,ESPOSITO>要不要坐直升机进入啊
<25-2,ESPOSITO>What about through a helicopter?

799
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,810
<25-3,ESPOSITO>你在干嘛呢
<25-3,ESPOSITO>What are you doing?

800
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,210
<25-4,ESPOSITO>快放下
<25-4,ESPOSITO>Put that down.

801
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,020
<25-5,ESPOSITO>你疯了吗
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Are you crazy?

802
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,440
<25-7,RYAN>祝大家都圣诞快乐
<25-7,RYAN>Merry Christmas to all...

803
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,610
<25-8,ESPOSITO>祝大家晚安
<25-8,ESPOSITO>And to all a good night.

804
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,090
<26-1,DUNNE>我已经告诉过你们当时我在哪儿
<26-1,DUNNE>I already told you where I was,

805
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,750
<26-1,DUNNE>反正不是在直升机里
<26-1,DUNNE>and it wasn't in any helicopter.

806
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,810
<26-2,CASTLE>是啊  关于那个
<26-2,CASTLE>Yeah, about that.

807
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,200
<26-2,CASTLE>我们查过了黑人区青年俱乐部的照片
<26-2,CASTLE>We checked the photos from the harlem youth club.

808
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,350
<26-2,CASTLE>那边的圣诞老人可不是你
<26-2,CASTLE>The Santa that was there was not you.

809
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,350
<26-3,BECKETT>你当晚到底在哪儿
<26-3,BECKETT>Where were you that night, really?

810
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,570
<26-3,BECKETT>我来帮你回忆一下
<26-3,BECKETT>Let me help you.

811
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,630
<26-3,BECKETT>我刚和查克·埃姆斯通完电话
<26-3,BECKETT>I just got off of the phone with Chuck Ames,

812
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,100
<26-3,BECKETT>也就是拿架直升机的主人
<26-3,BECKETT>the guy that owns that helicopter,

813
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,730
<26-3,BECKETT>他说你之前从他手中租用过
<26-3,BECKETT>and he said that you've rented it from him before.

814
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,420
<26-4,DUNNE>我是认识那家伙  那又怎样
<26-4,DUNNE>So I know the guy. So what?

815
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,980
<26-4,DUNNE>你们没有证据证明当晚我在那架直升机上
<26-4,DUNNE>You got no proof that I was in that helicopter that night.

816
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,090
<26-5,BECKETT>那是因为你还回来时  把指纹都擦干净了
<26-5,BECKETT>That's because you wiped it down when you brought it back.

817
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,650
<26-5,BECKETT>但你顺走了一些东西  不是吗
<26-5,BECKETT>But you took something with you, didn't you?

818
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,900
<26-5,BECKETT>我们在你的公寓里找到了这个
<26-5,BECKETT>We found this in your apartment.

819
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,320
<26-6,CASTLE>现在想改下你的口供吗
<26-6,CASTLE>Care to revise your statement?

820
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,500
<26-7,BECKETT>我再帮你回忆一下
<26-7,BECKETT>Let me help you again.

821
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,870
<26-7,BECKETT>艾德蒙德想出了一个
<26-7,BECKETT>Edmund figured out a way

822
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,370
<26-7,BECKETT>让你们二人迅速发家致富的方法
<26-7,BECKETT>to make a quick score for you both.

823
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,860
<26-7,BECKETT>他在派对上工作
<26-7,BECKETT>He worked the party,

824
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,790
<26-7,BECKETT>你驾驶着逃跑用的直升机
<26-7,BECKETT>And you were the getaway flier.

825
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,250
<26-7,BECKETT>等他上了直升机的时候
<26-7,BECKETT>And then when he got back into the chopper,

826
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,140
<26-7,BECKETT>你决定一个人独吞全部
<26-7,BECKETT>you decided you wanted it all for yourself.

827
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,580
<26-8,DUNNE>全部什么  他拿的不过就是个该死的钟
<26-8,DUNNE>All what? All he had was that damn clock.

828
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,560
<26-8,DUNNE>那可不是个普通的钟
<26-8,DUNNE>Not just any clock.

829
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,620
<26-9,CASTLE>托马斯·蒂莱吉的钟价值三万多美元
<26-9,CASTLE>A Tomas Tilledge worth $30,000.

830
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,370
<26-10,DUNNE>那破玩意儿值三万多吗
<26-10,DUNNE>That crap is worth 30 grand?

831
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
<26-11,CASTLE>你不知道吗
<26-11,CASTLE>You didn't know that?

832
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,700
<26-12,DUNNE>不  我  我没有杀他
<26-12,DUNNE>No, I-- and I didn't kill him.

833
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,720
<26-13,BECKETT>得了吧  大卫  你刚承认案发当时在现场
<26-13,BECKETT>Come on, Dave. You just admitted to being there.

834
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,260
<26-13,BECKETT>好吧  我确实在场
<26-13,BECKETT>All right! I was there.

835
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,840
<26-14,DUNNE>艾德说会付我两千块
<26-14,DUNNE>Ed said he'd pay me 2 grand

836
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,400
<26-14,DUNNE>只要我把直升机开到那栋大楼上
<26-14,DUNNE>to fly the chopper to that building,

837
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,780
<26-14,DUNNE>等着他搬上来一些东西  然后飞走
<26-14,DUNNE>wait while he loaded something on, and take off,

838
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,690
<26-14,DUNNE>装上去的可不是钟
<26-14,DUNNE>And it wasn't no clock.

839
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,870
<26-14,DUNNE>他想试试那直升机能承受多少的额外重量
<26-14,DUNNE>He wanted to know how much extra weight the chopper could handle.

840
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,090
<26-15,BECKETT>他打算装什么
<26-15,BECKETT>What was he planning on taking?

841
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,280
<26-16,DUNNE>他给了两千块  我就没多问
<26-16,DUNNE>For 2 grand, I didn't ask.

842
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,020
<26-16,DUNNE>我就把直升机开过去等着
<26-16,DUNNE>I just flew to the helipad and waited.

843
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,170
<26-16,DUNNE>然后突然间  艾德蒙德就冲了过来
<26-16,DUNNE>Then all of a sudden, here comes Edmund,

844
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,290
<26-16,DUNNE>带着钟在屋顶上跑
<26-16,DUNNE>running out on the roof with the clock,

845
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,670
<26-16,DUNNE>嘴里喊着  快走  快走
<26-16,DUNNE>yelling, "Go! Go! Go!"

846
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,150
<26-16,DUNNE>接下来我只知道  有人对我们开火
<26-16,DUNNE>Next thing I know, we're taking fire.

847
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,940
<26-17,BECKETT>-有人冲你们开枪吗  -是的
<26-17,BECKETT>- Someone was shooting at you? - Hell, yeah.

848
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,450
<26-18,DUNNE>艾德蒙德刚爬上去  就被他们射中了
<26-18,DUNNE>They nailed Edmund just as he boarded the chopper.

849
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,550
<26-19,CASTLE>你见到开枪的人了吗
<26-19,CASTLE>Did you see who it was?

850
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,330
<26-20,DUNNE>没有  当时太黑
<26-20,DUNNE>No, it was dark.

851
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,280
<26-20,DUNNE>我就赶紧起飞了
<26-20,DUNNE>I just cowboyed the hell out of there.

852
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,310
<26-20,DUNNE>可怜的艾德
<26-20,DUNNE>But poor Ed.

853
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,610
<26-20,DUNNE>我不停地喊  把该死的门关上
<26-20,DUNNE>I kept yelling to him to close the damn door,

854
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,630
<26-20,DUNNE>可等我回头看时  他已经死了
<26-20,DUNNE>but when I turned back, he was already dead.

855
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,060
<26-20,DUNNE>飞机晃得厉害  不知什么时候
<26-20,DUNNE>The chopper banked hard. Before I knew it,

856
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,360
<26-20,DUNNE>他已经不在了
<26-20,DUNNE>he was gone.

857
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,820
<27-1,CASTLE>如果大卫说的是实话
<27-1,CASTLE>Well, if Dave is telling the truth,

858
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,400
<27-1,CASTLE>那凶手就在那栋楼里
<27-1,CASTLE>the shooter was in that building.

859
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,850
<27-2,BECKETT>不只是这样
<27-2,BECKETT>Not just in the building.

860
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,430
<27-2,BECKETT>想要到达停机坪  只能通过凯斯商务
<27-2,BECKETT>The only access to the helipad is through Case Commerce,

861
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,440
<27-2,BECKETT>也就是说凶手当时就在派对上
<27-2,BECKETT>which means our killer was at the party.

862
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,290
<27-3,CASTLE>可艾德蒙德怎么会去派对
<27-3,CASTLE>Okay, but what was Edmund doing?

863
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,100
<27-3,CASTLE>他偷个那么重的东西到底要干吗
<27-3,CASTLE>What was he planning on stealing that weighed so much?

864
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,280
<27-3,CASTLE>再说他干嘛偷那破钟
<27-3,CASTLE>And why would he take that stupid clock?

865
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
<27-3,CASTLE>真是一团乱
<27-3,CASTLE>It makes no sense.

866
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,610
<27-4,ESPOSITO>现在更乱了
<27-4,ESPOSITO>It makes even less sense now.

867
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,500
<27-5,RYAN>我们在查看电梯监控时
<27-5,RYAN>We were running through elevator security footage

868
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,340
<27-5,RYAN>发现了一个并不在
<27-5,RYAN>and we found one person who went up to the party

869
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,290
<27-5,RYAN>客人名单上的人
<27-5,RYAN>who wasn't on the guest list.

870
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,110
<27-6,BECKETT>那个邻居小孩  蒂姆·卡伯特
<27-6,BECKETT>The neighbor kid-- Tim Cabot?

871
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,660
<27-7,CASTLE>看他手里的东西
<27-7,CASTLE>And look what he's holding.

872
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,610
<27-8,BECKETT>一个摩托车头盔
<27-8,BECKETT>A motorcycle helmet.

873
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,380
<27-8,BECKETT>这么说他就是那天晚上骑摩托
<27-8,BECKETT>So he was the one that followed Edmund

874
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,760
<27-8,BECKETT>跟踪艾德蒙德的人
<27-8,BECKETT>on the motorcycle that night.

875
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,790
<27-9,ESPOSITO>这孩子有前科
<27-9,ESPOSITO>Kid's got a record, too--

876
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,830
<27-9,ESPOSITO>破门入室  袭击他人  非法占有
<27-9,ESPOSITO>B&E, assault, possession.

877
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,530
<27-10,BECKETT>可他到那个地方去干吗
<27-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but what the hell was he doing there?

878
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,210
<27-11,GATES>我想我知道原因
<27-11,GATES>I think I may have an answer.

879
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,750
<27-11,GATES>记得那起针对日湾基金公司的集体诉讼吗
<27-11,GATES>Remenber that class-action suit against SunCove Funding?

880
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,300
<27-12,BECKETT>嗯
<27-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

881
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,860
<27-13,GATES>我让证交会的朋友帮我查到了这些
<27-13,GATES>My contact at the S.E.C. dug these up.

882
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,280
<27-13,GATES>日湾公司成立的原始条款
<27-13,GATES>SunCove's original articles of incorporation,

883
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,170
<27-13,GATES>上面有账户持有人的签名
<27-13,GATES>showing the name of the account signatory.

884
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,650
<27-13,GATES>看着眼熟吗
<27-13,GATES>Look familiar?

885
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,340
<27-14,BECKETT>詹姆斯·艾德蒙德·史密斯  就是死者
<27-14,BECKETT>"James Edmund Smith," the victim.

886
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,450
<27-15,CASTLE>圣诞老人就是
<27-15,CASTLE>Santa is the shark

887
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,240
<27-15,CASTLE>骗取人们房子的元凶
<27-15,CASTLE>who bilked those people out of their homes?

888
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,350
<27-16,GATES>他的罪过不仅限于此
<27-16,GATES>He has more blood on his hands than that.

889
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,490
<27-16,GATES>蒂姆·卡伯特的父亲死于一场车祸
<27-16,GATES>Tim Cabot's father died in a car crash.

890
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,830
<27-16,GATES>拜艾德蒙德·史密斯所赐  为了还清膨胀贷款
<27-16,GATES>Fell asleep at the wheel working three jobs

891
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,090
<27-16,GATES>他要干三份工作  最后在开车时睡着了
<27-16,GATES>to pay his inflated mortgage, courtesy of Edmund Smith.

892
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,830
<27-16,GATES>车祸发生在五年前的圣诞夜平安夜
<27-16,GATES>That was Christmas Eve, five years ago.

893
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,740
<27-17,RYAN>就是艾德蒙德离开他妻子的那个圣诞节
<27-17,RYAN>The Christmas that Edmund walked out on his life.

894
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,570
<27-17,RYAN>这么说
<27-17,RYAN>So...

895
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,390
<27-18,CASTLE>这是一个赎罪的故事
<27-18,CASTLE>it's a tale of redemption.

896
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,260
<27-18,CASTLE>艾德蒙德搬到了
<27-18,CASTLE>Edmund moves next door

897
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,070
<27-18,CASTLE>这个被他毁掉的家庭隔壁
<27-18,CASTLE>to the family whose lives he destroyed,

898
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,410
<27-18,CASTLE>全心全意地补偿他们
<27-18,CASTLE>dedicating his life to repairing theirs,

899
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,070
<27-18,CASTLE>没有告诉他们自己的真实身份
<27-18,CASTLE>never telling them who he really is.

900
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,090
<27-19,ESPOSITO>蒂姆会不会知道了他的身份
<27-19,ESPOSITO>But what if Tim found out?

901
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,940
<27-20,CASTLE>那这就是另一个不同的故事了
<27-20,CASTLE>Then it's a very different tale.

902
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,650
<28-2,BECKETT>很抱歉  卡伯特夫人
<28-2,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Mrs. Cabot,

903
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,120
<28-2,BECKETT>我们要跟你儿子谈谈
<28-2,BECKETT>but we need to speak to your son.

904
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,870
<28-2,BECKETT>你妈妈不知情  对不对
<28-2,BECKETT>Your mom doesn't know, does she?

905
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,750
<28-2,BECKETT>不过你知道
<28-2,BECKETT>But you do.

906
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,220
<29-1,CASTLE>你知道他的身份
<29-1,CASTLE>You knew who he was,

907
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,740
<29-1,CASTLE>知道他是如何毁了你们的生活
<29-1,CASTLE>and how he ruined your lives.

908
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,320
<29-2,TIM>没错
<29-2,TIM>Yeah.

909
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,740
<29-2,TIM>我都知道
<29-2,TIM>Yeah, I-I knew.

910
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,370
<29-3,BETH>蒂姆  什
<29-3,BETH>Tim, wh--

911
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,730
<29-4,TIM>都是艾德干的  妈
<29-4,TIM>It was, Ed, mom.

912
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,820
<29-4,TIM>他曾经在日湾工作  是他把我们害成这样
<29-4,TIM>He was SunCove. He's the one who bled us dry.

913
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,980
<29-5,BETH>艾德  帮我们的艾德吗
<29-5,BETH>Ed? Our Ed?

914
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,940
<29-6,BECKETT>你发现真相时一定很气愤
<29-6,BECKETT>You must have been pretty angry when you found out.

915
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,210
<29-7,TIM>当然  我当然生气
<29-7,TIM>Hell, yeah, I was angry.

916
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,950
<29-7,TIM>他告诉我一切时  我真想杀了他
<29-7,TIM>When he told me, I wanted to kill him.

917
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,520
<29-7,TIM>可我没那么做
<29-7,TIM>But I didn't.

918
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,450
<29-7,TIM>等等
<29-7,TIM>Wait.

919
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,580
<29-8,CASTLE>他告诉了你
<29-8,CASTLE>He told you?

920
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,530
<7-9,BETH>没错  就在上周
<7-9,BETH>Yeah. Last week.

921
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,540
<29-8,CASTLE>他乞求我的原谅
<29-8,CASTLE>He asked for my forgiveness

922
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,700
<29-9,TIM>说自己想弥补我们
<29-9,TIM>and he said he wanted to make things right.

923
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,000
<29-9,TIM>律师本来要放弃诉讼了
<29-9,TIM>The lawyer was gonna drop the lawsuit,

924
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,550
<29-9,TIM>可艾德说他不能再袖手旁观
<29-9,TIM>but Ed said he couldn't sit by anymore.

925
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,930
<29-9,TIM>他知道能让我们赢下官司的关键证据在哪
<29-9,TIM>He knew where there was evidence that could win our case,

926
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,910
<29-9,TIM>可他需要我帮忙
<29-9,TIM>but he needed my help.

927
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:52,970
<29-10,BECKETT>什么样的忙
<29-10,BECKETT>What kind of help?

928
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,680
<29-11,TIM>我很擅长开锁
<29-11,TIM>I'm good with locks, all right?

929
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,720
<29-11,TIM>他让我跟着服务员溜进那个派对
<29-11,TIM>He needed me to slip in to the party with the waitstaff

930
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,440
<29-11,TIM>然后撬开后面储藏室的们
<29-11,TIM>and jimmy open the storage room door in back.

931
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,880
<29-12,BECKETT>为什么你之前不告诉我们
<29-12,BECKETT>And why didn't you tell us this before?

932
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,200
<29-13,TIM>因为我不能再让自己陷入麻烦了
<29-13,TIM>Because I couldn't get in trouble again.

933
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,600
<29-13,TIM>我得在家陪我妈
<29-13,TIM>I need to be here for my mom.

934
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,190
<29-14,BETH>储藏室里都有什么
<29-14,BETH>What was in the storage room?

935
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,050
<29-15,TIM>文件  有好几箱
<29-15,TIM>Files. Boxes of 'em.

936
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,930
<29-15,TIM>艾德蒙德说这些都是原始文件
<29-15,TIM>Edmund said that they were the original,

937
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:15,270
<29-15,TIM>是日湾公司未经篡改的贷款文件
<29-15,TIM>unaltered loan docs from SunCove.

938
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,930
<29-15,TIM>这就是为了打赢官司他所需要的证据
<29-15,TIM>They were the evidence he needed to set things right.

939
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,660
<29-16,BECKETT>他过去的某个同事肯定在凯斯商务工作
<29-16,BECKETT>One of his old partners must be at Case Commerce.

940
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,030
<29-16,BECKETT>他认出了艾德蒙德
<29-16,BECKETT>He recognized Edmund,

941
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,840
<29-16,BECKETT>意识到他是来偷文件的
<29-16,BECKETT>realized he was going after those files.

942
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,570
<29-17,CASTLE>这就是为什么他需要直升飞机
<29-17,CASTLE>And that's why he needed the helicopter.

943
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,410
<29-17,CASTLE>带着文件他没法从前门出去
<29-17,CASTLE>He couldn't exactly cart them out the front door.

944
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:29,020
<29-18,BECKETT>由于整个楼层都是警察
<29-18,BECKETT>And with the cops all over the building,

945
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,180
<29-18,BECKETT>凶手也没办法销毁那些文件
<29-18,BECKETT>it would've been risky for the killer to destroy them.

946
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,700
<29-19,CASTLE>说明文件还在原处
<29-19,CASTLE>Which means they're still there.

947
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,060
<29-20,BECKETT>跟凶手在一起
<29-20,BECKETT>Along with our killer.

948
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,820
<30-1,DENISE>我想拦下他们  可他们有搜查令
<30-1,DENISE>I tried to stop them, but they had a warrant.

949
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,510
<30-2,CASE>这到底是怎么一回事
<30-2,CASE>What the hell is this all about?

950
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,850
<30-3,CASTLE>我们也正想说同样的话
<30-3,CASTLE>We were about to ask you the same thing.

951
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,220
<30-3,CASTLE>告诉你们
<30-3,CASTLE>I'm telling you,

952
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,260
<31-1,CASE>我从来没见过这些文件
<31-1,CASE>I've never seen those files in my life.

953
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,250
<31-2,BECKETT>那它们怎么会在
<31-2,BECKETT>So then what were they doing

954
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,430
<31-2,BECKETT>你办公室的储藏室  凯斯先生
<31-2,BECKETT>in your office storage space, Mr. Case?

955
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,440
<31-3,CASE>我完全不知情
<31-3,CASE>I don't have the slightest idea.

956
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,970
<31-4,BECKETT>我们真的要这么周旋下去
<31-4,BECKETT>Are we really gonna play this game,

957
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,450
<31-4,BECKETT>看你否认一些咱们都心知肚明的事情吗
<31-4,BECKETT>where you deny things that you and I both know are true?

958
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,540
<31-4,BECKETT>就像上次
<31-4,BECKETT>Like you telling me

959
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,810
<31-4,BECKETT>你告诉我们不认识艾德蒙德一样
<31-4,BECKETT>that you didn't know Edmund?

960
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,010
<31-4,BECKETT>我们做了背景调查
<31-4,BECKETT>We ran a background check.

961
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,230
<31-4,BECKETT>你跟艾德蒙德曾是商业伙伴
<31-4,BECKETT>You and Edmund were business associates.

962
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,420
<31-4,BECKETT>你不会否认自己认识他
<31-4,BECKETT>So why would you claim that you didn't know him

963
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,170
<31-4,BECKETT>除非你是想隐藏什么
<31-4,BECKETT>unless you were hiding something,

964
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,430
<31-4,BECKETT>比如说过去在日湾基金公司工作过的事实
<31-4,BECKETT>like your involvement with SunCove Funding?

965
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,040
<31-4,BECKETT>你们俩是不是谈论过如果扭曲规则
<31-4,BECKETT>Did the two of you talk about how much money you could make

966
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,750
<31-4,BECKETT>就可以赚大钱
<31-4,BECKETT>if you could just bend the rules,

967
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,420
<31-4,BECKETT>做一些造假文件就可以轻而易举
<31-4,BECKETT>how easy it would be to forge documents

968
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,170
<31-4,BECKETT>让人们背负起自己根本还不起的债务
<31-4,BECKETT>to put people into mortgages that they couldn't afford,

969
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,780
<31-4,BECKETT>然后把他们的房子卖给投资者
<31-4,BECKETT>and how you could make a quick buck

970
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,380
<31-4,BECKETT>自己就可以赚一大笔呢
<31-4,BECKETT>by selling them off to investors?

971
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,350
<31-5,CASE>光凭这些文件你们根本查不到我头上
<31-5,CASE>There's nothing in those files that can implicate me,

972
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,960
<31-5,CASE>也无法证明我跟日湾基金公司
<31-5,CASE>and nothing to tie me to SunCove Funding

973
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,760
<31-5,CASE>或那个男人的死有何关系
<31-5,CASE>or to that man's death.

974
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,820
<31-6,BECKETT>那个被偷的钟是从哪来的
<31-6,BECKETT>That clock that was stolen, where did it come from?

975
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,550
<31-7,CASE>不知道  我得问问室内装潢师
<31-7,CASE>I'm not sure. I'll have to ask my decorator.

976
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,910
<31-8,BECKETT>别麻烦了  我们已经
<31-8,BECKETT>Don't bother. We already have documents

977
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,190
<31-8,BECKETT>拿到文件证明它是卡伯特家的东西
<31-8,BECKETT>that prove it belonged to the Cabots.

978
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,370
<31-9,CASE>卡伯特一家是什么人
<31-9,CASE>Who are the Cabots?

979
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,830
<31-10,BECKETT>是你曾经谋害过的众多家庭中的某个
<31-10,BECKETT>One of the families whose house you stole.

980
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,710
<31-10,BECKETT>他们把那口钟作为贷款抵押品
<31-10,BECKETT>They put that clock up as collateral against a loan,

981
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,380
<31-10,BECKETT>还不起贷款时
<31-10,BECKETT>and when they couldn't make the payments,

982
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,200
<31-10,BECKETT>日湾就有权扣押那口钟
<31-10,BECKETT>SunCove Funding kept it,

983
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,150
<31-10,BECKETT>就是它
<31-10,BECKETT>and that...

984
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,620
<31-10,BECKETT>能证明你在日湾工作过
<31-10,BECKETT>connects you to SunCove.

985
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,780
<31-11,BECKETT>你那晚见到艾德蒙德时
<31-11,BECKETT>When you saw Edmund that night,

986
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,100
<31-11,BECKETT>就意识到他是为了那些文件而来的
<31-11,BECKETT>you realized that he was going after the files

987
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,400
<31-11,BECKETT>因为他打算曝光日湾
<31-11,BECKETT>because he was gonna blow the whistle on SunCove.

988
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,250
<31-11,BECKETT>你知道艾德蒙德会把你也牵连进去
<31-11,BECKETT>You knew that Edmund could implicate you,

989
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,680
<31-11,BECKETT>于是你就杀了他
<31-11,BECKETT>so you killed him.

990
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,800
<31-12,CASE>不  你错了
<31-12,CASE>No. You're wrong.

991
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,960
<31-13,BECKETT>检察院会冻结你所有资产
<31-13,BECKETT>The U.S. Attorneys' office would freeze your assets.

992
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,090
<31-13,BECKETT>你所有的钱都会被没收
<31-13,BECKETT>They would seize all of your money.

993
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,030
<31-13,BECKETT>你会失去一切
<31-13,BECKETT>You were gonna lose everything.

994
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,730
<31-13,BECKETT>动机有了  机会也有了
<31-13,BECKETT>Now that is motive, that is opportunity,

995
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,360
<31-13,BECKETT>足够让陪审团给你定罪了
<31-13,BECKETT>and that is enough for any jury to convict you.

996
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,050
<31-13,BECKETT>我没杀艾德蒙德
<31-13,BECKETT>I did not kill Edmund.

997
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,330
<31-14,CASE>但是我知道凶手是谁
<31-14,CASE>But I know who did.

998
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,730
<31-14,CASE>她来了
<31-14,CASE>She was here.

999
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,960
<31-14,CASE>她来参加派对了
<31-14,CASE>She stopped by the party.

1000
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,930
<32-1,GWENN>开什么玩笑  我为什么要杀他
<32-1,GWENN>You must be kidding me? Why would I kill him?

1001
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,760
<32-2,BECKETT>因为他无法再这样活下去
<32-2,BECKETT>Because he couldn't live with himself any longer,

1002
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,150
<32-2,BECKETT>他为自己的行为感到愧疚
<32-2,BECKETT>with what he had done,

1003
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,860
<32-2,BECKETT>那就意味着他将夺走
<32-2,BECKETT>which meant that he was gonna take away

1004
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,360
<32-2,BECKETT>离婚后  他留给你的唯一一样东西
<32-2,BECKETT>the one thing that he left you after the divorce--

1005
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,340
<32-2,BECKETT>富足的生活
<32-2,BECKETT>Your lifestyle,

1006
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,630
<32-2,BECKETT>那生活是依靠日湾供给的
<32-2,BECKETT>paid for by Suncove Profits.

1007
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,700
<32-3,CASTLE>他不是找你来道歉的
<32-3,CASTLE>He didn't come to you to apologize that night, did he?

1008
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,280
<32-3,CASTLE>他来警告你
<32-3,CASTLE>He came to warn you, because he knew

1009
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,960
<32-3,CASTLE>因为他知道他一旦举报了日湾
<32-3,CASTLE>that if he blew the whistle on Suncove,

1010
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,180
<32-3,CASTLE>你就失去了一切
<32-3,CASTLE>you stood to lose everything.

1011
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,800
<32-4,GWENN>这太荒谬了
<32-4,GWENN>This is absurd.

1012
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,820
<32-5,BECKETT>你知道他要去哪  你也知道原因
<32-5,BECKETT>You knew where he was going and you knew why.

1013
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,490
<32-5,BECKETT>所以你跟踪他来到房顶
<32-5,BECKETT>So you followed him to the rooftop,

1014
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,880
<32-5,BECKETT>射杀了他
<32-5,BECKETT>and then you shot him.

1015
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
<32-6,GWENN>我当时在参加慈善晚宴
<32-6,GWENN>I was at the benefit.

1016
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,490
<32-7,BECKETT>我们知道你在凯斯商务
<32-7,BECKETT>We know you were at Case Commerce.

1017
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,490
<32-7,BECKETT>我们有目击证人  你杀了艾德蒙德
<32-7,BECKETT>We have a witness. You killed Edmund.

1018
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,630
<32-8,GWENN>当他离开的时候  他说他没想过伤害我
<32-8,GWENN>When he left me, he told me, he never wanted to hurt me.

1019
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,570
<32-8,GWENN>在伤害你之前
<32-8,GWENN>That's what people always say

1020
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,890
<32-8,GWENN>人们都这么说
<32-8,GWENN>right before they hurt you.

1021
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,340
<32-8,GWENN>是的  他留给了我富足的生活
<32-8,GWENN>Yes, he left me my lifestyle.

1022
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,420
<32-8,GWENN>五年之后  他出现在我门口
<32-8,GWENN>Five years later, he shows up on my doorstep,

1023
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,250
<32-8,GWENN>再次对我说他没想过要伤害我
<32-8,GWENN>Telling me again how he doesn't want to hurt me.

1024
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,020
<32-8,GWENN>知道最糟糕的是什么吗
<32-8,GWENN>You know what the worst part is?

1025
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,470
<32-8,GWENN>有那么一刻  看到他站在那
<32-8,GWENN>Just for a moment, when he stood there that night,

1026
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,920
<32-8,GWENN>我好开心
<32-8,GWENN>I was happy to see him.

1027
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,620
<33-1,CASTLE>你得佩服这家伙
<33-1,CASTLE>You got to admire the guy.

1028
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,660
<33-1,CASTLE>放弃了所有去弥补过失
<33-1,CASTLE>Sacrificed everything to redeem himself.

1029
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,490
<33-1,CASTLE>最后还是被过去夺去了生命真可惜
<33-1,CASTLE>It's too bad his past caught up with him.

1030
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,530
<33-2,GATES>不管怎么说  那些档案寄到检察院去了
<33-2,GATES>Still, those files are on their way to the U.S. Attorneys' office.

1031
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,510
<33-2,GATES>卡伯特一家有机会夺回失去的东西了
<33-2,GATES>Now the Cabots have a real shot at getting back what they lost.

1032
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,140
<33-3,BECKETT>还有其他42个家庭
<33-3,BECKETT>Along with the 42 other families,

1033
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,530
<33-3,BECKETT>都是因为艾德蒙德
<33-3,BECKETT>All because of Edmund.

1034
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,470
<33-4,GATES>说到家被人偷了
<33-4,GATES>Speaking of people having their homes stolen...

1035
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,100
<33-5,BECKETT>又是你婆婆吗  长官
<33-5,BECKETT>Is that your mother-in-law again, sir?

1036
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,630
<33-6,GATES>探长  如果你今天收到消息
<33-6,GATES>Detective, if you happen to receive a report

1037
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,350
<33-6,GATES>我家发生了命案
<33-6,GATES>of a homicide tonight at my address,

1038
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,370
<33-6,GATES>帮了忙
<33-6,GATES>do me a favor.

1039
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,530
<33-7,BECKETT>-不要理会  -遵命
<33-7,BECKETT>- Ignore it. - Yes, sir.

1040
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,940
<33-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看来你是对的
<33-8,BECKETT>Well, Castle. Looks like you might have been right.

1041
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,750
<33-8,BECKETT>还真有圣诞老人
<33-8,BECKETT>Maybe there is a Santa Claus after all.

1042
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,790
<33-8,BECKETT>不管有没有圣诞老人
<33-8,BECKETT>Whether there's a Santa Claus or not,

1043
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,620
<33-9,CASTLE>那不是我爱圣诞节的原因
<33-9,CASTLE>that's not why I love christmas.

1044
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,210
<33-9,CASTLE>我小时候
<33-9,CASTLE>When I was a kid,

1045
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,470
<33-9,CASTLE>不管生活有多糟
<33-9,CASTLE>no matter how bad things got,

1046
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,480
<33-9,CASTLE>我妈总是能把圣诞节前夜变得很梦幻
<33-9,CASTLE>my mother always managed to make Christmas Eve magical.

1047
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,030
<33-9,CASTLE>每年她都会放《胡桃夹子》
<33-9,CASTLE>Every year she would put on "The nutcracker suite."

1048
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,530
<33-9,CASTLE>我就想  在我们既穷又孤独的时候
<33-9,CASTLE>And I thought, if she can do that in our tiny apartment

1049
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,760
<33-9,CASTLE>她都能让我们的小公寓那么有节日气氛
<33-9,CASTLE>when money was tight and we were alone,

1050
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,610
<33-9,CASTLE>那给了我希望  一切会好起来
<33-9,CASTLE>it gave me hope that things could get better.

1051
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,160
<33-9,CASTLE>我喜欢那种感觉  希望的感觉
<33-9,CASTLE>I love that feeling, that sense of hope.

1052
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,430
<33-9,CASTLE>其实挺奇怪的
<33-9,CASTLE>It's crazy, you know?

1053
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,860
<33-9,CASTLE>在全年最短最黑的一天
<33-9,CASTLE>On the shortest, darkest days of the year,

1054
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,990
<33-9,CASTLE>所有人都在庆祝光明
<33-9,CASTLE>people of all faiths celebrate the light.

1055
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,350
<33-9,CASTLE>再说了  谁会不喜欢礼物
<33-9,CASTLE>Plus, who doesn't love presents?

1056
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,570
<33-10,CASTLE>圣诞节快乐
<33-10,CASTLE>Merry christmas.

1057
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,630
<33-11,BECKETT>圣诞节快乐
<33-11,BECKETT>You, too.

1058
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,240
<34-1,ESPOSITO>你怎么还没走
<34-1,ESPOSITO>What you still doing here?

1059
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
