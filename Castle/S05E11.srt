28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,040

<2-4,CASTLE>and you choose very, very poorly,

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,050
<2-4,CASTLE>你是不是就失去选片权了
<2-4,CASTLE>do you lose your turn?

30

<2-10,CASTLE>-规矩如此嘛  -净瞎说
<2-10,CASTLE>- Those are the rules. - That's ridiculous.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,630
<3-1,ESPOSITO>一个找罐头的流浪汉
<3-1,ESPOSITO>So the body was found in this dumpster over here

36
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,450
<3-1,ESPOSITO>在垃圾箱里发现了尸体
<3-1,ESPOSITO>by a homeless dude who was looking for cans.

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,270
<3-1,ESPOSITO>尸体用这块油布裹着
<3-1,ESPOSITO>It was wrapped up in this tarp.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,910
<3-2,BECKETT>死因
<3-2,BECKETT>'cause?

00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,050
<3-2,BECKETT>枪伤
<3-2,BECKETT>G.S.W.

40
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,900
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>据我观察是近距离开枪
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>As near as I could tell, she was shot at close range.

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,120
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>流血稀少
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>Minimal blood seepage

42
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,350
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>周围没有血液喷溅
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>and lack of spatter in the area suggests

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,640
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>她是在别处遇害  弃尸在这
<3-3,LANIE PARISH>she was killed elsewhere, then dumped here.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,760
<3-4,CASTLE>凶手希望她早上能被垃圾车拖走
<3-4,CASTLE>So someone was hoping she'd catch a ride with the morning haul,

45
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,140
<3-4,CASTLE>消失在垃圾场里
<3-4,CASTLE>disappear under some landfill.

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,340
<3-5,BECKETT>知道身份吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Any idea who she is?

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,640
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>证件上写着是霍莉·罗兹
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>Well, according to her I.D., her name is Holly Rhodes.

48
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,300
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>但她的名片上写着是DJ比特
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>But her business card has her listed as D.J. Beat.

49
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,940
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>打电话询问  她的经纪人说
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>Called the number, and her booking agent says that

50
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,960
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>她昨晚去苏豪为歌星雷吉娜·凯恩的专辑
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>she was deejaying an album launch party in SOHO last night

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,380
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>发行派对做DJ
<3-6,KEVIN RYAN>for pop star Regina Cane.

52
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,490

<3-7,ESPOSITO>哥们  记得那个MV吗
<3-7,ESPOSITO>Aw, dude. You remember that music video

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,410
<3-7,ESPOSITO>她扮成性感女童军
<3-7,ESPOSITO>where she was dressed up as a sexy little girl scout?

55
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,800
<3-7,ESPOSITO>不管那饼干有多贵
<3-7,ESPOSITO>I don't care what those cookies cost.

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
<3-7,ESPOSITO>我愿卖了左...
<3-7,ESPOSITO>I would sell my left...

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,790
<3-8,RYAN>总之  她到凌晨1点都应该在派对上
<3-8,RYAN>Anyway, she was booked at the party till 1:00 a.m.

58
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,120
<3-10,RYAN>-1点  -嗯  怎么了
<3-10,RYAN>- 1:00 a.m.? - Yeah, why?

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,590
<3-11,LANIE>我认为死亡时间在晚11点到午夜之间
<3-11,LANIE>We're placing the time of death between 11:00 and midnight.

60
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,220
<3-12,CASTLE>那么她是在派对上遇害的
<3-12,CASTLE>So whatever happened happened at that party.

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,540
<3-13,BECKETT>这个墨迹像是新的
<3-13,BECKETT>This ink looks fresh.

62
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,520
<3-14,ESPOSITO>号码不在电话薄上
<3-14,ESPOSITO>It's an unlisted number.

63
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
<3-14,ESPOSITO>我给电话公司打电话了
<3-14,ESPOSITO>I got a call in to the phone company.

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,290
<3-15,BECKETT>你们在这一带盘查
<3-15,BECKETT>All right, you guys set up a canvass

65
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,440
<3-15,BECKETT>看有没有人目击弃尸
<3-15,BECKETT>for anyone that saw the body dump.

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,980
<3-15,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去苏豪
<3-15,BECKETT>Castle and I would head down to SOHO,

67
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,470
<3-15,BECKETT>问问昨晚的事
<3-15,BECKETT>see what happened last night.

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,670
<4-1,BECKETT>早啊
<4-1,BECKETT>Good morning.

69
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,570
<4-2,CASTLE>好尽兴的派对
<4-2,CASTLE>Killer party.

70
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,690
<4-3,BECKETT>看来雷吉娜为推销专辑不遗余力啊
<4-3,BECKETT>Well, it looks like Regina went all out to promote her new album.

71
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,730
<4-4,CASTLE>我还记得阿丽克西斯曾经一遍遍地
<4-4,CASTLE>I remember when Alexis used to play her big hit

72
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,030
<4-4,CASTLE>播放她的热曲《为爱痴狂》
<4-4,CASTLE>"Call Me Crazy" over and over again.

73
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,410
<4-4,CASTLE>我都要发狂了
<4-4,CASTLE>Drove me crazy.

74
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,300
<4-4,CASTLE>当然  比不上《情人节》更让人抓狂
<4-4,CASTLE>Of course, it was no "Valentine's Day."

75
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,980
<4-5,BECKETT>打扰  纽约警局  主人在哪
<4-5,BECKETT>Excuse me, NYPD. Where's the host?

76

<4-6,CASTLE>别管主人了  你裤子呢
<4-6,CASTLE>Forget the host. Where's your pants?

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,390
<4-6,CASTLE>是不是
<4-6,CASTLE>Am I right?

78
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,970
<4-6,CASTLE>我也经历过  去游泳池边看看
<4-6,CASTLE>Nah. I've been there. Check by the pool.

79
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,100

<5-2,BECKETT>As in, a detective.

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,380
<5-2,BECKETT>我们为霍莉·罗兹而来
<5-2,BECKETT>We're here about Holly Rhodes.

83
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,140
<5-3,REGINA>那是谁
<5-3,REGINA>Who is Holly Rhodes?

84
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,270
<5-4,CASTLE>DJ比特
<5-4,CASTLE>D.J. Beat.

85
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,760
<5-4,CASTLE>她给你的派对做DJ
<5-4,CASTLE>She was your deejay for your party.

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,110
<5-5,REGINA>那个贱人啊
<5-5,REGINA>Oh, that skank.

87
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,990
<5-5,REGINA>那贱人几乎毁了我的派对
<5-5,REGINA>Yeah, bitch almost ruined my entire party.

88
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,920
<5-5,REGINA>我为表演做准备时
<5-5,REGINA>When I left to get ready for my performance,

89
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,050
<5-5,REGINA>她本该保持大家情绪高涨的
<5-5,REGINA>she was supposed to stay and get the crowd pumped.

90
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,910
<5-5,REGINA>可是她却没影了  音乐也停了
<5-5,REGINA>Instead, the music stopped, and she was gone.

91
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,420
<5-6,REGINA>她都没回来拿器材
<5-6,REGINA>She didn't even come back to get her equipment.

92
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,580
<5-7,BECKETT>那么说她早走了
<5-7,BECKETT>So you're saying that she left early?

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,730
<5-7,BECKETT>对
<5-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

94
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,300
<5-8,REGINA>是啊  11点放了个播放列表就走了
<5-8,REGINA>Around 11:00, after jacking in a playlist.

95
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,910
<5-8,REGINA>我花钱不是让她弄个播放列表了事的
<5-8,REGINA>I didn't pay for a playlist.

96
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,160
<5-8,REGINA>如果你们看见她  告诉她我要退钱
<5-8,REGINA>If you see her, tell her I want my money back.

97
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,630
<5-9,CASTLE>这个有点困难了
<5-9,CASTLE>That might be a little tough,

98
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,930
<5-9,CASTLE>她死了
<5-9,CASTLE>seeing as she's dead.

99
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,190
<5-9,CASTLE>她离开你的派对后就死了
<5-9,CASTLE>She was killed just after leaving your party.

100
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,900
<5-10,REGINA>好啊  现在我为抱怨她而不好受了
<5-10,REGINA>Great. Now I feel bad for complaining.

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,740
<5-11,BECKETT>你注意到她有异常的行为了吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Did you notice any unusual behavior?

102
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,050
<5-11,BECKETT>她跟其他客人起争执了吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Was she having problems with any of your other guests?

103
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,720
<5-12,REGINA>没有  不过我当时忙着招呼大家呢
<5-12,REGINA>No. But then again, I was busy making my rounds.

104
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,670
<5-12,REGINA>好吧
<5-12,REGINA>Right. Okay.

105

<5-13,BECKETT>Well, I'll need a guest list

106
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,370
<5-13,BECKETT>以及昨晚所有在这里工作的人的名单
<5-13,BECKETT>along with the names of everyone that was working last night.

107
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,710
<5-14,REGINA>没问题
<5-14,REGINA>No problem.

108

<5-14,REGINA>我马上让我的公关发给你们
<5-14,REGINA>I'll have my publicist send it right over.

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,090
<6-1,RYAN>我问过其他几位派对上的宾客
<6-1,RYAN>So I spoke with several of the other party guests,

110
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,910
<6-1,RYAN>他们都证实了雷吉娜的话
<6-1,RYAN>and they confirm Regina's story.

111
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,930
<6-1,RYAN>霍莉是突然离场的
<6-1,RYAN>Apparently, Holly just suddenly left.

112
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,310
<6-2,CASTLE>工作中途离场  为什么
<6-2,CASTLE>In the middle of her set, why?

113
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,540
<6-3,BECKETT>如果能查明原因  也就知道动机了
<6-3,BECKETT>Well, we answer that, we'll find out why she was killed.

114
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,610
<6-3,BECKETT>有人看到她去哪了吗
<6-3,BECKETT>Anyone see where she went?

115
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,990
<6-4,RYAN>没有  没有监控摄像头
<6-4,RYAN>No, and there's no security cameras.

116
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,320
<6-4,RYAN>我在查对面街的商店有没有可用录像
<6-4,RYAN>I'm seeing if I can pull tape from businesses across the street.

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,410
<6-5,BECKETT>你们找到亲属了吗
<6-5,BECKETT>Did you get ahold of next of kin?

118
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,170
<6-6,RYAN>她没有亲人  霍莉是独生女
<6-6,RYAN>Nah. She doesn't have any. Holly was an only child.

119
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,770
<6-6,RYAN>18岁之前一直在寄养家庭间辗转
<6-6,RYAN>Bounced around foster care till she was 18.

120
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,220
<6-7,CASTLE>这样的童年肯定不幸福
<6-7,CASTLE>That can't have been an easy childhood.

121
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,680
<6-8,RYAN>这也许是她年少时经常
<6-8,RYAN>Probably why her hobbies as a teenager

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,250
<6-8,RYAN>盗窃和偷窃的原因
<6-8,RYAN>include burglary and shoplifting.

123
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,050
<6-8,RYAN>最终升级到重偷窃罪
<6-8,RYAN>Then she graduated to grand theft.

124
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,270
<6-9,BECKETT>还有近期的案底吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Anything more recent?

125
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,650
<6-10,RYAN>这七年没有了
<6-10,RYAN>Not in the last seven years.

126
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,670
<6-10,RYAN>她开始专职做DJ之后
<6-10,RYAN>She must have cleaned up her act

127
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,150
<6-10,RYAN>肯定是金盆洗手了
<6-10,RYAN>when she got serious about being a deejay.

128
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,190
<6-10,RYAN>还有
<6-10,RYAN>Oh, and hey, get this.

129
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,650
<6-10,RYAN>在霍莉公寓盘查的警员找到一位邻居
<6-10,RYAN>The uniforms canvassing Holly's apartment building found a neighbor

130
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,980
<6-10,RYAN>说几天前看到一名男子猛敲霍莉家的门
<6-10,RYAN>who saw a man pounding on Holly's door a few days ago.

131
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,770
<6-11,BECKETT>为什么事
<6-11,BECKETT>What was it about?

132
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,310
<6-12,RYAN>邻居听见他喊"你逃不掉的"
<6-12,RYAN>The neighbor heard him scream, "You won't get away with this."

133
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,330
<6-12,RYAN>霍莉要么是不在家  要么是有意不应门
<6-12,RYAN>Either Holly wasn't home or she wouldn't answer the door,

134
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,720
<6-12,RYAN>那人最终还是走了
<6-12,RYAN>and eventually, the guy took off.

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,690
<6-12,RYAN>邻居这会儿正在做描述画像
<6-12,RYAN>Neighbor is with a sketch artist as we speak.

136
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,830
<6-13,BECKETT>好的
<6-13,BECKETT>Okay.

137
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,900
<6-14,ESPOSITO>我查到了霍莉手上那个电话号码
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Yo. I got a hit on that phone number written on Holly's hand.

138
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,530
<6-14,ESPOSITO>是泰瑞斯·威尔顿的号码
<6-14,ESPOSITO>It belongs to a Tyrese Wilton.

139
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,650
<6-14,ESPOSITO>是个大牌音乐制作人
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Apparently he's some big-time record producer.

140
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,200
<6-15,CASTLE>他在宾客名单上  他也去了派对
<6-15,CASTLE>He's on the guest list. He was at the party.

141
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,300
<6-16,BECKETT>你们去盘问他
<6-16,BECKETT>You guys see what he knows.

142
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,560
<6-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  蕾妮查明被害人被害的地点了
<6-16,BECKETT>Castle, Lanie knows where our victim was killed.

143
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,110
<7-1,LANIE>我剪开她衣服的时候就注意到了
<7-1,LANIE>I noticed it when I was cutting her out of her clothes--

144
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,830
<7-1,LANIE>她衣服上有污渍
<7-1,LANIE>Stains on her outfit.

145
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,290
<7-1,LANIE>实验室分析结果是花生油
<7-1,LANIE>The lab identified it as peanut oil

146
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,470
<7-1,LANIE>含高浓度的谷氨酸钠
<7-1,LANIE>with high concentrations of M.S.G.

147
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,680
<7-2,CASTLE>那么她是吃中餐的时候撒在衣服上了吗
<7-2,CASTLE>Meaning what, she was eating chinese food and spilled some on herself?

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,740
<7-3,LANIE>但是  我查了她胃部
<7-3,LANIE>Except I checked her stomach contents.

149
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,610
<7-3,LANIE>没有中餐
<7-3,LANIE>No Chinese.

150
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,600
<7-3,LANIE>而且派对上也没有中餐
<7-3,LANIE>And they weren't serving any at the party either.

151
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,950
<7-3,LANIE>所以我问了鉴证组
<7-3,LANIE>So I checked with C.S.U.

152
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,190
<7-3,LANIE>他们说垃圾箱上完全没有
<7-3,LANIE>They said there was no trace of it in the dumpster,

153
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,130
<7-3,LANIE>但是油布上到处是  所以
<7-3,LANIE>but it's all over the tarp, meaning...

154
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,890
<7-4,BECKETT>她可能是在中餐馆或附近被杀
<7-4,BECKETT>She may have been killed at or near a Chinese restaurant.

155
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,090
<7-5,CASTLE>那么曼哈顿的大街小巷都有可能了
<7-5,CASTLE>Narrowing it down to every single block in Manhattan.

156
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,450
<7-6,BECKETT>枪呢
<7-6,BECKETT>Uh, what about the gun?

157
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,950
<7-7,LANIE>点38的弹头
<7-7,LANIE>Slug is from a .380,

158
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,270
<7-7,LANIE>但是系统里查不到相符弹道
<7-7,LANIE>but there were no ballistic hits in the system.

159
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,490
<7-7,LANIE>鉴证组检查油布和衣物的时候
<7-7,LANIE>Oh, and when C.S.U. processed the tarp and the clothes,

160
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,390
<7-7,LANIE>还找到了这个  人造纤维
<7-7,LANIE>they also found these-- synthetic fibers.

161
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,620
<7-7,LANIE>也不是垃圾桶里的
<7-7,LANIE>They didn't come from the dumpster either.

162
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,270
<7-7,LANIE>实验室还在化验中
<7-7,LANIE>But the lab is still running tests.

163
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,450
<7-7,LANIE>有结果我会通知你
<7-7,LANIE>I'll keep you posted.

164
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,530
<8-1,RYAN>如果泰瑞斯这么大牌
<8-1,RYAN>If Tyrese is so big-time,

165
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,110
<8-1,RYAN>为什么他工作室的入口在小巷子里
<8-1,RYAN>why is the entrance to his studio in an alley?

166
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
<8-2,ESPOSITO>因为名人不希望被狗仔队
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Because celebrities don't want paparazzi

167
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,250
<8-2,ESPOSITO>一天到晚拍照片
<8-2,ESPOSITO>taking their picture all the time.

168
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,530
<8-2,ESPOSITO>喂  你刚摸了头发吗
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Yo, did you just do the hair thing?

169
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,790
<8-3,RYAN>什么摸头发
<8-3,RYAN>What hair thing?

170
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,040
<8-4,ESPOSITO>每次你要去见名人或是美女
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Every time you're about to meet a celebrity or a pretty girl,

171
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,540
<8-4,ESPOSITO>你就会用手抚弄头发
<8-4,ESPOSITO>you run your hand through your hair.

172
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,350
<8-5,RYAN>TMZ网站说泰瑞斯
<8-5,RYAN>T.M.Z. said that Tyrese

173
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,710
<8-5,RYAN>是与乔茜·朗一起参加派对的
<8-5,RYAN>was at that party with Josie Lang.

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,230
<8-5,RYAN>他在制作她的新专辑
<8-5,RYAN>He's producing her new album.

175
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,700
<8-6,ESPOSITO>她还是比不上雷吉娜
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, she's no Regina.

176
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,510
<8-7,RYAN>我明白她那女童军的形象
<8-7,RYAN>I understand that the image of her as a girl scout

177
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,930
<8-7,RYAN>令你刻骨铭心
<8-7,RYAN>is seared into your memory,

178
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,230
<8-7,RYAN>但乔茜有唱功
<8-7,RYAN>But Josie is a real vocalist.

179
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,900
<8-8,ESPOSITO>她的粉丝全是12岁小女生
<8-8,ESPOSITO>Whose fan base consists of 12-year-old girls...

180
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,080

<9-2,JOSIE LANG>Hey, Ty, you want me to take that from the second bar?

<9-3,TYRESE>抱歉  小乔  我们停一下
<9-3,TYRESE>Sorry, Jo. We gotta take 15.

184
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,790
<9-4,RYAN>既然乔茜有参加派对
<9-4,RYAN>Hey, since Josie was at the party,

185
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,060
<9-4,RYAN>我应该去给她录个口供
<9-4,RYAN>I should probably take her statement, right?

186
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,510
<9-4,RYAN>这里交给你没问题吧  多谢

<9-5,TYRESE>Sorry. This is such a crazy thing.

188
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,010
<9-5,TYRESE>我不敢相信她死了
<9-5,TYRESE>I can't believe she's dead.

189
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,990
<9-6,ESPOSITO>你跟霍莉有多熟  泰瑞斯
<9-6,ESPOSITO>How well did you know Holly, Tyrese?

<9-7,TYRESE>I met her for the first time at the party.

<9-7,TYRESE>我和乔茜一起去的
<9-7,TYRESE>I was there with Josie

192
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,400
<9-7,TYRESE>因为我们在合作她的新专辑
<9-7,TYRESE>'cause we've been working on her album,

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,740
<9-7,TYRESE>而我以前是雷吉娜的制作人
<9-7,TYRESE>and I used to produce Regina back in the day.

194

<9-11,TYRESE>I gave her my digits so we could set up a meeting.

197
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,660
<9-12,ESPOSITO>为了什么事
<9-12,ESPOSITO>About what?

198
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,820
<9-13,TYRESE>要说我拿手的  就是赏识人才
<9-13,TYRESE>If there's one thing I'm good at, it's spotting talent.

199
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,630
<9-13,TYRESE>她的混音与节奏感
<9-13,TYRESE>Her mashups and beat match went better

200
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,330
<9-13,TYRESE>比大多数现在出专辑的男DJ还要优秀
<9-13,TYRESE>than most of the guys dropping albums today.

201
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,240
<9-13,TYRESE>我被她震惊了
<9-13,TYRESE>I was blown away.

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,060
<9-13,TYRESE>我告诉她我想助她更上一层楼
<9-13,TYRESE>I told her I wanted to take her to the next level.

203
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,150
<9-14,ESPOSITO>那她有什么反应
<9-14,ESPOSITO>So how'd she react to that?

204
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,890
<9-15,TYRESE>非常激动
<9-15,TYRESE>She was thrilled.

205
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,990
<9-15,TYRESE>说这样的机会是她一直在争取的
<9-15,TYRESE>Said a break like this is what she'd been working for.

206
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,540
<9-15,TYRESE>她应该今天打电话给我的
<9-15,TYRESE>She was supposed to call me today.

207
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,680
<9-16,ESPOSITO>你知不知道她为什么提前离开了派对
<9-16,ESPOSITO>You have any idea why she rushed out of that party early?

208
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,830
<9-17,TYRESE>不知道  可能跟那场争吵有关
<9-17,TYRESE>Nah. Coulda had something to do with that fight, though.

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,500
<9-18,ESPOSITO>什么争吵
<9-18,ESPOSITO>What fight?

210
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,560
<9-19,TYRESE>你听说过大恶棍吗
<9-19,TYRESE>You heard of M.C. Thug?

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,140
<9-20,ESPOSITO>大恶棍  那个说唱歌手
<9-20,ESPOSITO>M.C. Thug? Yeah, the rapper.

212
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,210
<9-20,ESPOSITO>-被枪击过七次  对吗  -就是他
<9-20,ESPOSITO>- Been shot like seven times, right? - That's the one.

213
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,380
<9-21,TYRESE>霍莉第一次休息时  他走到了工作台前
<9-21,TYRESE>Now on Holly's first break, he walked over to her booth,

214
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,160
<9-21,TYRESE>生气地跟她说了些什么
<9-21,TYRESE>starts talking to her real low and angry.

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,640
<9-21,TYRESE>我看得出来她生气了
<9-21,TYRESE>I could see she was getting upset,

216
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,620
<9-21,TYRESE>想推开他
<9-21,TYRESE>tried to push him away.

217
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,170
<9-21,TYRESE>然后他抓住她的手腕说
<9-21,TYRESE>Then he grabbed her wrist and said,

218
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,040
<9-21,TYRESE>下次  结果就不是这样了
<9-21,TYRESE>"Next time, it's gonna end different."

219

<12-12,CARSON>这事跟我可没有关系
<12-12,CARSON>I had nothing to do with that mess.

275
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,200
<12-13,BECKETT>但你跟她之间有过节

<13-1,ESPOSITO>So Kaiya confirms that she was "Hanging out" with M.C. Thug

303
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,110
<13-1,ESPOSITO>一起"玩"到12点半
<13-1,ESPOSITO>in one of the bedrooms till 12:30.

<13-2,RYAN>他的确有报警说丢了钻石手链
<13-2,RYAN>And he did file a police report about the missing bracelet.

305
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,380
<13-2,RYAN>所以我调了一份去年
<13-2,RYAN>So I requested a list of all the parties

306
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,850
<13-2,RYAN>霍莉工作的所有派对的记录
<13-2,RYAN>that Holly worked in the past year.

<13-2,RYAN>超过50场派对
<13-2,RYAN>Of the more than 50 events,

308
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,270
<13-2,RYAN>有七宗失窃案
<13-2,RYAN>turns out that thefts were reported in seven of them.

309
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,920
<13-2,RYAN>作案手法全一样  大多数是偷高档珠宝
<13-2,RYAN>M.O. is the same every time-- mostly high-end jewelry.

310
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,120
<13-2,RYAN>总价值差不多有五十万
<13-2,RYAN>In total, almost half a million bucks.

311
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,850
<13-2,RYAN>都是在高档住宅区办的派对上偷的
<13-2,RYAN>All taken from parties at upscale residences.

312
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,540
<13-2,RYAN>我从霍莉的经纪人那里得知
<13-2,RYAN>And I also confirmed with Holly's booking agent

313
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,090
<13-2,RYAN>她工作时有个助理
<13-2,RYAN>that she always worked with an assistant--

314
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,940
<13-2,RYAN>保罗·特维斯
<13-2,RYAN>Paul Travers.

315
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,620
<13-3,BECKETT>也就是说他们俩是一伙的
<13-3,BECKETT>Okay, so the two of them are a crew

316
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,920
<13-3,BECKETT>借着她的手艺  进入高档住宅
<13-3,BECKETT>using her deejay skills to access high-end homes

317
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,350
<13-3,BECKETT>顺手牵羊
<13-3,BECKETT>and then cleaning them out along the way.

318
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,550
<13-4,ESPOSITO>她以前确实有过盗窃史
<13-4,ESPOSITO>She does have a history of theft,

319
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,850
<13-4,ESPOSITO>没准是重操旧业了
<13-4,ESPOSITO>so maybe she went back to her old ways.

320
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,540
<13-5,CASTLE>如果那个助理和她一起参加了派对的话
<13-5,CASTLE>But if the assistant worked the party with her,

321
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,150
<13-5,CASTLE>他现在在哪呢  怎么不见踪影了
<13-5,CASTLE>then where is he and why hasn't he come forward?

322
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,910
<13-6,BECKETT>只有一个原因  他被牵涉其中
<13-6,BECKETT>There's only one reason. He was involved.

323
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,150
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>牵涉什么
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>I-involved in what?

324
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,290
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>我的朋友去世了  你们的意思是
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>My friend is dead, and now you're saying, what,

325
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,850
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>我们是"邦妮和克莱德"吗[雌雄大盗]
<14-1,PAUL TRAVERS>like, we're like Bonnie and Clyde?

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,530
<14-2,BECKETT>都有盗窃案发生
<14-2,BECKETT>that you both worked.

328
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,860
<14-3,PAUL>因为她有案底  就一定是她干的吗
<14-3,PAUL>Oh, and so because of her history, it's gotta be her?

329
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,670
<14-3,PAUL>音乐拯救了她  她已经改过自新了
<14-3,PAUL>Music saved her. She was done with that life.

330
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,670
<14-4,CASTLE>那你呢
<14-4,CASTLE>And what about you?

331
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,820
<14-4,CASTLE>据霍莉的经纪人所说
<14-4,CASTLE>According to Holly's agency,

332
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,400
<14-4,CASTLE>你负责安装和拆卸器具
<14-4,CASTLE>you were responsible for setting up and breaking down the equipment.

333
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,550
<14-6,BECKETT>-然后呢  -你昨晚没有把器具归位
<14-6,BECKETT>- So? - So you never broke it down last night.

334
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,030
<14-6,BECKETT>你中途离开了派对  一去不回
<14-6,BECKETT>You left the party, never came back,

335
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,820
<14-6,BECKETT>霍莉也一样
<14-6,BECKETT>same as Holly.

336
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,960
<14-6,BECKETT>区别是你现在还活着  她却归了西
<14-6,BECKETT>Only you're still alive, and she's dead.

337
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,040
<14-7,PAUL>-昨晚吗  -对
<14-7,PAUL>- Last night? - Mm-hmm.

338
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,380
<14-9,PAUL>我昨晚压根没去
<14-9,PAUL>I wasn't even there last night.

339
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,240
<14-10,BECKETT>保罗  别说谎
<14-10,BECKETT>Paul, don't lie.

340
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,310
<14-10,BECKETT>她的单子上有你的名字
<14-10,BECKETT>She's got you listed on her invoice.

341
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,620
<14-11,PAUL>我知道
<14-11,PAUL>Yeah, I... I-I know.

342
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,200
<14-11,PAUL>近一年来她好几次都是临时打给我
<14-11,PAUL>A few times this past year, she'd call me up last minute

343
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,480
<14-11,PAUL>说要换人
<14-11,PAUL>to say she was using another guy.

344
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,030
<14-11,PAUL>通常是说她的表亲之类的需要这份工作
<14-11,PAUL>It was, like, her cousin or something, and he needed the work.

345
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,690
<14-11,PAUL>我知道她挺愧疚的
<14-11,PAUL>I-I know she felt bad about it

346
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,260
<14-11,PAUL>因为她还是照付了我的工钱
<14-11,PAUL>'cause she still offered to pay me anyway.

347
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,040
<14-12,PAUL>昨天晚上我去参加生日晚餐了
<14-12,PAUL>I-I was at a birthday dinner last night.

348
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,820
<14-12,PAUL>我有证人
<14-12,PAUL>I have witnesses.

349
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,580
<14-13,CASTLE>这些派对里
<14-13,CASTLE>Which of these parties

350
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,080
<14-13,CASTLE>有哪些你没参加
<14-13,CASTLE>did the other guy work?

351
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,030
<14-14,PAUL>这个
<14-14,PAUL>This one.

352
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,650
<14-14,PAUL>这个  这个
<14-14,PAUL>This one. Here.

353
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,220
<14-14,PAUL>这个  这个
<14-14,PAUL>This one. This one.

354
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,530
<14-14,PAUL>这个  和那个
<14-14,PAUL>This one, and that one.

355
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,670
<14-15,CASTLE>正好是有盗窃案发生的派对
<14-15,CASTLE>The same ones that reported robberies.

356
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,640
<15-1,RYAN>目前只有一个目击证人  一个服务员
<15-1,RYAN>So far only one witness, a caterer,

357
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,220
<15-1,RYAN>记得昨晚有人安装了霍莉的设备
<15-1,RYAN>remembers seeing a guy setting up Holly's equipment last night.

358
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,410
<15-1,RYAN>她是从背面看到的
<15-1,RYAN>And she only saw him from behind,

359
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,410
<15-1,RYAN>他当时穿着帽衫
<15-1,RYAN>and he was wearing a hoodie.

360
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,180
<15-1,RYAN>我们在询问其他派对嘉宾
<15-1,RYAN>So we've reached out to other party guests

361
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,270
<15-1,RYAN>看有没有人能描述得详细一点
<15-1,RYAN>to see if we can get a better description.

362
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,520
<15-2,BECKETT>昨晚有东西被窃吗
<15-2,BECKETT>So was anything stolen from the party last night?

363
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,830
<15-3,RYAN>没有  我们问过所有人了
<15-3,RYAN>No. We asked everyone.

364
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,680
<15-3,RYAN>到现在为止没有任何物品失踪报告
<15-3,RYAN>And so far, no one's reported anything missing.

365
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,570
<15-4,ESPOSITO>警员又搜查了霍莉的公寓
<15-4,ESPOSITO>So UNIs searched Holly's apartment again.

366
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,850
<15-4,ESPOSITO>没找到被窃物品
<15-4,ESPOSITO>There's no sign of the stolen goods,

367
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,260
<15-4,ESPOSITO>她的账号也没有大笔资金流入
<15-4,ESPOSITO>and there's no influx of cash into her account,

368
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,040
<15-4,ESPOSITO>所以就算她在以此挣钱
<15-4,ESPOSITO>so if she was making money off this thing,

369
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,240
<15-4,ESPOSITO>也没有相关证据
<15-4,ESPOSITO>there's no evidence of it.

370
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,400
<15-4,ESPOSITO>会不会是
<15-4,ESPOSITO>What if this

371
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,910
<15-5,CASTLE>这个神秘的助理掌控了一切
<15-5,CASTLE>mystery assistant is the one behind it all?

372
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,960
<15-5,CASTLE>想想看吧
<15-5,CASTLE>I mean, think about it.

373
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,460
<15-5,CASTLE>他强迫霍莉带他进入这些派对
<15-5,CASTLE>He forces Holly to get him into these parties.

374
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,200
<15-5,CASTLE>她忙着工作的时候
<15-5,CASTLE>While she's busy spinning,

375
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,560
<15-5,CASTLE>他就可以随心所欲地在豪宅里走动
<15-5,CASTLE>he's free to walk around these fancy apartments.

376
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,720
<15-5,CASTLE>而他是工作人员
<15-5,CASTLE>And since he's hired help,

377
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,860
<15-5,CASTLE>没人会留意他
<15-5,CASTLE>nobody pays him any attention.

378
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,190
<15-5,CASTLE>真是易如反掌
<15-5,CASTLE>It's candy from a baby.

379
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,990
<15-6,ESPOSITO>但当大恶棍质问霍莉时  她害怕了
<15-6,ESPOSITO>But when M.C. Thug confronted Holly, she got scared.

380
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,360
<15-6,ESPOSITO>所以她决定告发那个助理
<15-6,ESPOSITO>So she threatened to blow the whistle on the assistant.

381
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,320
<15-7,BECKETT>这确实可以成为谋杀动机
<15-7,BECKETT>Well, that would certainly give him motive for murder.

382
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,580
<15-8,RYAN>但单子上是保罗的名字
<15-8,RYAN>But with Paul's name on the invoice,

383
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,990
<15-8,RYAN>没有他的记录  要怎样才能找到他呢
<15-8,RYAN>there's no record of him. How are we gonna find him?

384
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,210
<15-9,CASTLE>昨晚是他安装了那些器具  对吧
<15-9,CASTLE>He helped set up that equipment last night, right?

385
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,990
<15-9,CASTLE>那上面应该有他的指纹
<15-9,CASTLE>His fingerprints would be on it.

386
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,820
<15-10,BECKETT>叫鉴证组去查
<15-10,BECKETT>Get C.S.U. on it.

387
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,700
<16-1,CASTLE>好繁重的工作啊  我一会儿再来
<16-1,CASTLE>Grunt work. I'll come back later.

388
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,490
<16-2,BECKETT>-你留下咖啡就行  -有何发现
<16-2,BECKETT>- So long as you leave the coffee. - What did you find?

389
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,400
<16-3,CASTLE>霍莉的通话记录
<16-3,CASTLE>Holly's phone records.

390
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,990
<16-4,BECKETT>她总会在有盗窃案发生的派对当天
<16-4,BECKETT>She received calls from a pay phone in Washington Heights

391
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,130
<16-4,BECKETT>接到来自华盛顿高地
<16-4,BECKETT>the same days that she was booked

392
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,130
<16-4,BECKETT>一处付费电话的来电
<16-4,BECKETT>for the parties where the thefts happened.

393
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,690
<16-5,CASTLE>也许是她的神秘助理打来询问细节的
<16-5,CASTLE>Well, maybe it's her mystery assistant, calling for details.

394
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,230
<16-6,BECKETT>霍莉就是在华盛顿高地长大的
<16-6,BECKETT>Holly grew up in the heights,

395
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,520
<16-6,BECKETT>所以有可能是老邻居
<16-6,BECKETT>so it might be someone from the old neighborhood,

396
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,920
<16-6,BECKETT>但我们还是找不到他
<16-6,BECKETT>but it doesn't bring us any closer to finding him.

397
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,810
<16-6,BECKETT>没必要费心了
<16-6,BECKETT>Doesn't need to.

398
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,620
<16-7,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在器材上取到一副指纹
<16-7,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. matched a print on that equipment

399
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,150
<16-7,ESPOSITO>和一个叫做乔伊·马龙的人相符  代号"怪兽"
<16-7,ESPOSITO>to one Joey Malone-- street name, "Monster."

400
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,090
<16-7,ESPOSITO>他的前科累累
<16-7,ESPOSITO>He's got a list of priors a mile long.

401
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,540
<16-7,ESPOSITO>警员在华盛顿高地抓到了他
<16-7,ESPOSITO>UNIs took him down in Washington Heights.

402
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,230
<16-9,ESPOSITO>已经押回来了  去看看吧
<16-9,ESPOSITO>He's in the box. Come take a look.

403
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,670
<16-10,ESPOSITO>怪兽
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Monster?

404
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,710
<16-7,ESPOSITO>这名字听起来像是帮派团伙
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Now that sounds like the kind of ganged-up thug

405
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,710
<16-8,CASTLE>能一枪要你命
<16-8,CASTLE>that would shoot you dead

406
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,410
<16-8,CASTLE>然后把你丢在某个垃圾堆的那种
<16-8,CASTLE>and leave you in a dumpster someplace.

407
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,100
<16-8,CASTLE>一半血肉之躯  一半壮如高山
<16-8,CASTLE>Probably half man, half mountain,

408
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,510
<16-8,CASTLE>全身都是监狱纹身
<16-8,CASTLE>full of prison tats.

409
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,390
<16-8,CASTLE>或者  是那种沉默的危险分子
<16-8,CASTLE>Or is he quietly dangerous?

411
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,710
<16-8,CASTLE>有着贾维尔·巴登
<16-8,CASTLE>You know, like, Javier Bardem

412
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,860
<16-8,CASTLE>在影片中的那种奇怪发型
<16-8,CASTLE>in any movie where he's got weird hair.

413
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,750
<16-9,ESPOSITO>你自己一睹芳容吧
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Just take a look for yourself.

414
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,550
<16-10,ESPOSITO>这位就是
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Behold...

415
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,130
<16-10,ESPOSITO>怪兽
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Monster.

416
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,370
<16-11,CASTLE>更像饼干怪兽
<16-11,CASTLE>More like cookie monster.

417
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,970
<17-1,BECKETT>我们对这小子有什么了解
<17-1,BECKETT>So what do we know about this kid?

418
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,280
<17-2,ESPOSITO>首先他不是霍莉的亲戚
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Well, he's not related to Holly, for one.

419
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,850
<17-2,ESPOSITO>他的父亲在他七岁时死于吸毒过量
<17-2,ESPOSITO>His father died of a drug overdose when he was 7.

420
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,480
<17-2,ESPOSITO>母亲在几年前自杀身亡
<17-2,ESPOSITO>His mom committed suicide a couple of years ago.

421
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,430
<17-2,ESPOSITO>他的叔叔马丁·戴克
<17-2,ESPOSITO>His uncle--Martin Decker--

422
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,740
<17-2,ESPOSITO>后来成为了他的监护人
<17-2,ESPOSITO>is the one who took over guardianship.

423
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,900
<17-3,BECKETT>他的叔叔现在在哪
<17-3,BECKETT>Where's his uncle now?

424
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,260
<17-4,ESPOSITO>他不在家  我联系了社会服务
<17-4,ESPOSITO>He's not at home. I notified social services,

425
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,500
<17-4,ESPOSITO>他们或许知道怎样联系到他
<17-4,ESPOSITO>thinking they might know how to reach him.

426
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,910
<17-5,BECKETT>你说他有前科
<17-5,BECKETT>You said that he had priors.

427
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,670
<17-6,ESPOSITO>对  他曾因非法侵入
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he was busted for breaking and entering,

428
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,450
<17-6,ESPOSITO>盗窃罪和拒捕而被捕
<17-6,ESPOSITO>burglary, resisting arrest.

429
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,310
<17-7,BECKETT>现在他升级到谋杀了
<17-7,BECKETT>Now he's moved up to the big leagues.

430
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,550
<17-8,ESPOSITO>现在怎么办
<17-8,ESPOSITO>So, uh, what's the plan here?

431
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,050
<17-9,BECKETT>我一个人进去  省得他觉得咱们以多欺少
<17-9,BECKETT>I'm gonna go in alone so he doesn't feel outnumbered,

432
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,750
<17-9,BECKETT>看他怎么说
<17-9,BECKETT>see what he's made out of.

433
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,130
<17-10,CASTLE>他才14岁
<17-10,CASTLE>He's 14.

434
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,200
<17-10,CASTLE>难以相信他能做这些事
<17-10,CASTLE>It's hard to believe he's capable of something like this.

435
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
<17-11,ESPOSITO>在他的世界就不奇怪了
<17-11,ESPOSITO>Not in his world, it isn't.

436
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,780
<18-1,BECKETT>乔伊
<18-1,BECKETT>Hi, Joey.

437
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,880
<18-1,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<18-1,BECKETT>I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

438
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,260
<18-2,JOEY MALONE>你可真是个辣妹
<18-2,JOEY MALONE>A major Hottie is what you are.

439
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,830
<18-3,BECKETT>好了  不说废话
<18-3,BECKETT>Okay. Now that we got that cleared up,

440
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,310
<18-3,BECKETT>你得回答我几个问题
<18-3,BECKETT>I need to ask you a few questions.

441
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,030
<18-4,JOEY>你得先征得我监护人的允许
<18-4,JOEY>You need permission from my guardian.

442
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,700
<18-4,JOEY>据我回忆  我还未成年
<18-4,JOEY>The last time I checked, I'm a minor.

443
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,290
<18-5,BECKETT>我们正在努力联系你叔叔
<18-5,BECKETT>Well, we're making our best effort to get ahold of your uncle.

444
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,070
<18-5,BECKETT>但同时  纽约警局的规定允许我和你谈话
<18-5,BECKETT>In the meantime, NYPD policy allows me to talk to you.

445
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,050
<18-6,JOEY>那就说吧
<18-6,JOEY>Well, so talk.

446
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,770
<18-7,BECKETT>我们在查霍莉·罗兹被害一案
<18-7,BECKETT>We're looking into the murder of Holly Rhodes.

447
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,790
<18-8,JOEY>我听说这事了
<18-8,JOEY>Heard about that.

448
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,880
<18-8,JOEY>我很难过
<18-8,JOEY>Real sad.

449
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,540
<18-9,BECKETT>我知道两天前  你还给她打过工
<18-9,BECKETT>I understand that two nights ago, you worked for her.

450
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,580
<18-9,BECKETT>你当时看见她和谁起过分歧没
<18-9,BECKETT>Did you see her having problems with anyone?

451
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,670
<18-10,JOEY>没
<18-10,JOEY>No.

452
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,620
<18-11,BECKETT>你知道她为什么提前离开派对吗
<18-11,BECKETT>Do you know why she left the party early?

453
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,170
<18-12,JOEY>不知道
<18-12,JOEY>Nope.

454
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,700
<18-13,BECKETT>-你知道她去哪了吗  -不晓得
<18-13,BECKETT>- Do you know where she went? - No clue.

455
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,310
<18-14,JOEY>那我这么问你吧
<18-14,JOEY>Okay, let me ask you this--

456
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,630
<18-15,BECKETT>你觉得霍莉为什么会雇个有前科的
<18-15,BECKETT>Why did you think Holly hired a 14-year-old kid

457
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,150
<18-15,BECKETT>14岁小毛孩做她的技术助理
<18-15,BECKETT>With a record to be her tech assistant?

458
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,960
<18-16,JOEY>因为我最棒啊
<18-16,JOEY>'cause I'm the best.

459
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,490
<18-17,BECKETT>做什么最棒  偷东西吗
<18-17,BECKETT>The best at what, stealing?

460
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,610
<18-17,BECKETT>每次你帮霍莉做事
<18-17,BECKETT>Every time you've worked for Holly,

461
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,500
<18-17,BECKETT>都有高档珠宝遗失
<18-17,BECKETT>High-end jewelry has gone missing--

462
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,570
<18-17,BECKETT>每次都是
<18-17,BECKETT>Every single time.

463
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,060
<18-18,JOEY>我不知道啊
<18-18,JOEY>I don't know nothin' about that.

464
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,470
<18-19,BECKETT>霍莉知道你偷东西吗
<18-19,BECKETT>Did Holly know about the stealing

465
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,710
<18-19,BECKETT>或是当晚她发现了
<18-19,BECKETT>or did she find out that night?

466
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,060
<18-19,BECKETT>所以你就杀了她
<18-19,BECKETT>Is that why you killed her?

467
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,370
<18-20,JOEY>什么  什么  杀她
<18-20,JOEY>What--what? Kill her?

468
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,130
<18-20,JOEY>不不
<18-20,JOEY>No. No.

469
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,240
<18-20,JOEY>我没有杀她
<18-20,JOEY>I didn't do that.

470
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,880
<18-21,BECKETT>有目击者称见到你
<18-21,BECKETT>We have witnesses that saw you

471
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,580
<18-21,BECKETT>在她离开派对后马上就走了
<18-21,BECKETT>leave the party right after she did.

472
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,480
<18-21,BECKETT>你也没有再回来拿设备器材
<18-21,BECKETT>And you never came back for the equipment.

473
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,660
<18-21,BECKETT>那么在11点到午夜这段时间你在哪
<18-21,BECKETT>So where were you between 11:00 and midnight?

474
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,930
<18-22,JOEY>我在  我在"电视国王"
<18-22,JOEY>I was at-- I was at TV king.

475
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,790
<18-22,JOEY>你离开派对
<18-22,JOEY>You left the party

476
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,430
<18-23,BECKETT>不拿设备  去了"电视国王"
<18-23,BECKETT>and the equipment to go to TV King

477
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,510
<18-23,BECKETT>还是在半夜
<18-23,BECKETT>in the middle of the night?

478
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,990
<18-23,BECKETT>你应该想个更好的说辞  乔伊
<18-23,BECKETT>You're gonna have to do better than that, Joey.

479
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
<18-24,JOEY>他们允许你来盘问我
<18-24,JOEY>You may be allowed to talk to me...

480
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,440
<18-24,JOEY>但我不一定要回答
<18-24,JOEY>But I don't have to talk back.

481
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,360
<19-1,CASTLE>盗窃加谋杀
<19-1,CASTLE>Robbery and murder?

482
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,770
<19-1,CASTLE>或许野兽这绰号还不赖
<19-1,CASTLE>Maybe monster wasn't such a bad nickname after all.

483
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,570
<19-2,BECKETT>我还不能确定
<19-2,BECKETT>You know what? I'm not sure about that.

484
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,370
<19-2,BECKETT>他预料这场对话是关于盗窃的
<19-2,BECKETT>He expected the conversation about the stealing,

485
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,410
<19-2,BECKETT>但当我指控他谋杀霍莉的时候
<19-2,BECKETT>but when I accused him of murdering Holly,

486
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,320
<19-2,BECKETT>他懵了
<19-2,BECKETT>That threw him.

487
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,460
<19-3,RYAN>我知道原因了  乔伊的不在场证明成立了
<19-3,RYAN>And I think I know why. Joey's alibi checks out.

488
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,070
<19-4,BECKETT>真的吗  他在"电视国王"
<19-4,BECKETT>Seriously, he was at TV King?

489
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,000
<19-5,RYAN>副经理有时让他
<19-5,RYAN>The assistant manager sometimes lets him

490
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,620
<19-5,RYAN>在大屏幕上打游戏
<19-5,RYAN>play video games up on the big screen,

491
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,680
<19-5,RYAN>霍莉的死亡时间区内  乔伊一直在那里
<19-5,RYAN>and that's where Joey was during Holly's time of death.

492
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,780
<19-6,CASTLE>如果他没有杀霍莉  那会是谁呢
<19-6,CASTLE>Well, then if he didn't kill Holly, then who did?

493
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,050
<19-7,ESPOSITO>操控这一切的人  就是凶手
<19-7,ESPOSITO>The brains behind this operation, that's who.

494
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,000
<19-7,ESPOSITO>像乔伊这样砸橱窗抢劫的孩子
<19-7,ESPOSITO>A kid like Joey goes from smash-and-grabs

495
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,380
<19-7,ESPOSITO>转而偷50万的珠宝
<19-7,ESPOSITO>to stealing a half a mil in jewelry?

496
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,140
<19-7,ESPOSITO>我不这么认为
<19-7,ESPOSITO>I don't think so.

497
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,630
<19-7,ESPOSITO>有人在背后教唆
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Someone put him up to this.

498
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,860
<19-8,RYAN>对  这说得通  有时精明的罪犯
<19-8,RYAN>No, that makes sense. Sometimes savvy criminals

499
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,390
<19-8,RYAN>叫小喽啰去做不法的事
<19-8,RYAN>use minors to do their dirty work.

500
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,090
<19-9,CASTLE>当然
<19-9,CASTLE>Of course.

501
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,210
<19-9,CASTLE>就像《雾都孤儿》里的费金
<19-9,CASTLE>A Fagin to Joey's Oliver Twist.

502
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,310
<19-10,RYAN>如果再加上霍莉  她就是机灵鬼神偷
<19-10,RYAN>And if Holly's involved, that makes her the artful dodger,

503
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,280
<19-10,RYAN>或者狡猾DJ
<19-10,RYAN>or the artful deejay.

504
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,580
<19-11,CASTLE>推理得不错嘛
<19-11,CASTLE>Ooh, nicely played.

505
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,260
<19-12,BECKETT>这就解释了我们在霍莉或乔伊家
<19-12,BECKETT>And that would explain why we never found

506
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,810
<19-12,BECKETT>找不到赃物的原因
<19-12,BECKETT>the stolen loot in Holly or Joey's apartments.

507
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,200
<19-12,BECKETT>费金拿去了
<19-12,BECKETT>Fagin has it.

508
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,010
<19-13,RYAN>他有动机除掉霍莉
<19-13,RYAN>That gives him motive to get rid of Holly

509
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,180
<19-13,RYAN>如果她找他麻烦的话
<19-13,RYAN>if she ever gave him any trouble.

510
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,810
<19-14,ESPOSITO>如果我们猜对了
<19-14,ESPOSITO>Well, if we're right,

511
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,110
<19-14,ESPOSITO>那么乔伊肯定知道谁是凶手
<19-14,ESPOSITO>then Joey knows who our killer is.

512
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
<19-14,ESPOSITO>我来搞定这孩子
<19-14,ESPOSITO>I get this kid.

513
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,480
<19-14,ESPOSITO>我去跟他聊聊
<19-14,ESPOSITO>Let me get a crack at him.

514
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,290
<20-1,JOEY>那位超辣警探去哪了
<20-1,JOEY>Hey, where's the super-hot detective?

515
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,620
<20-2,ESPOSITO>不就是我吗  别笑
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Oh, you're looking at him. Don't laugh.

516
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,470
<20-2,ESPOSITO>我可上过纽约警局日历
<20-2,ESPOSITO>I was featured in the NYPD calendar.

517
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,050
<20-3,JOEY>肯定卖得"很好"
<20-3,JOEY>I bet that was a big seller.

518
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,290
<20-3,JOEY>那么
<20-3,JOEY>So, uh,

519
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,560
<20-3,JOEY>你肯定是来扮好警察的
<20-3,JOEY>you must be the good cop.

520
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,080
<20-4,ESPOSITO>这我就不知道了
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Well, I don't know about that.

521
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,670
<20-4,ESPOSITO>但我可以保你出去
<20-4,ESPOSITO>But I could be your ticket out of this.

522
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,070
<20-4,ESPOSITO>是吗
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah? Mm-hmm.

523
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,020
<20-5,JOEY>怎么保
<20-5,JOEY>How's that work?

524
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,080
<20-6,ESPOSITO>我们知道你没有杀霍莉
<20-6,ESPOSITO>We know you didn't kill Holly.

525
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,940
<20-6,ESPOSITO>你只是顺了一堆珠宝回去
<20-6,ESPOSITO>All you did was lift a bunch of jewelry.

526
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,250
<20-8,ESPOSITO>省省吧
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Nah, nah, just save it.

527
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,820
<20-8,ESPOSITO>我们不管珠宝的事
<20-8,ESPOSITO>We don't care about the jewelry.

528
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,570
<20-8,ESPOSITO>我们可以把指控全部撤销
<20-8,ESPOSITO>We can take those charges off the table.

529
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,220
<20-8,ESPOSITO>我们要的就是那个指使你的人的名字
<20-8,ESPOSITO>All we want is the guy who put you up to it.

530
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,420
<20-9,JOEY>我都不知道你在说些什么
<20-9,JOEY>I don't even know who you're talking about.

531
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,470
<20-9,JOEY>乔伊  行了
<20-9,JOEY>Joey, come...

532
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,800
<20-10,ESPOSITO>我刚给了你一张中了奖的彩票
<20-10,ESPOSITO>I just gave you the winning lottery ticket.

533
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,110
<20-10,ESPOSITO>你现在应该做的
<20-10,ESPOSITO>Now the right move here

534
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,070
<20-10,ESPOSITO>是兑现彩票  而不是撕了它
<20-10,ESPOSITO>is to cash that in, not tear it up.

535
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,150
<20-11,JOEY>我猜你接着要对我说
<20-11,JOEY>I bet this is the part where you tell me,

536
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,800
<20-11,JOEY>我不了解自己的处境多么严重
<20-11,JOEY>I don't know the seriousness of my situation.

537
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
<20-11,JOEY>除非我把知道的都告诉你
<20-11,JOEY>How unless I tell you everything I know,

538
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,910
<20-11,JOEY>不然你帮不了我
<20-11,JOEY>You can't help me.

539
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,720
<20-11,JOEY>然后你倾身向我  显得很关心我
<20-11,JOEY>And then you'll lean in close, like you care about me

540
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,360
<20-11,JOEY>好像是我朋友一样
<20-11,JOEY>and like you're my friend,

541
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,340
<20-11,JOEY>然后许下永远不会兑现的承诺
<20-11,JOEY>and you'll make promises you'll never keep.

542
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,170
<20-12,ESPOSITO>我说话算话  兄弟
<20-12,ESPOSITO>I keep all my promises, bro.

543
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,820
<20-13,JOEY>人人都那么说
<20-13,JOEY>That's what everybody says.

544
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,270
<20-14,ESPOSITO>这个条件是有时限的  乔伊
<20-14,ESPOSITO>This is a limited-time offer, Joey.

545
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,770
<20-15,JOEY>不感兴趣
<20-15,JOEY>Not interested.

546
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,970
<20-15,JOEY>好吧
<20-15,JOEY>Okay.

547
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,540
<20-16,ESPOSITO>看看这个
<20-16,ESPOSITO>I want you to take a look at this.

548
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,000
<20-16,ESPOSITO>这就是霍莉最后的样子
<20-16,ESPOSITO>This is how Holly ended up--

549
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,450
<20-16,ESPOSITO>被枪杀
<20-16,ESPOSITO>Shot,

550
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,250
<20-16,ESPOSITO>被抛尸于垃圾场
<20-16,ESPOSITO>tossed in the garbage.

551
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,370
<20-16,ESPOSITO>你觉得她该遭受这些吗
<20-16,ESPOSITO>Now you think she deserved that, hmm?

552
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,810
<20-16,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<20-16,ESPOSITO>Oh, wh-what?

553
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,600
<20-16,ESPOSITO>怎么不再自作聪明了呢
<20-16,ESPOSITO>No smart-ass comeback now, huh?

554
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,980
<20-16,ESPOSITO>你跟这个女人一起工作
<20-16,ESPOSITO>You worked with this woman.

555
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,040
<20-16,ESPOSITO>你了解她
<20-16,ESPOSITO>You knew her.

556
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,660
<20-16,ESPOSITO>同一个人
<20-16,ESPOSITO>The same guy

557
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,360
<20-16,ESPOSITO>教唆你和霍莉去偷珠宝
<20-16,ESPOSITO>who has you stealing jewelry did this to Holly.

558
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,260
<20-16,ESPOSITO>他利用你们这样的孩子
<20-16,ESPOSITO>He uses kids like you.

559
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,140
<20-16,ESPOSITO>却逍遥法外
<20-16,ESPOSITO>And then he just gets to walk away

560
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,790
<20-16,ESPOSITO>而你却要坐在这里回答我的问题
<20-16,ESPOSITO>while you have to sit in here and answer all my questions.

561
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,580
<20-16,ESPOSITO>你知道你现在对他来说是什么吗
<20-16,ESPOSITO>You know what you are to him right now?

562
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,340
<20-16,ESPOSITO>用剩的废物
<20-16,ESPOSITO>You're a loose end.

563
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,230
<20-16,ESPOSITO>好好看看这些
<20-16,ESPOSITO>So take a hard look,

564
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,680
<20-16,ESPOSITO>因为你也是这个下场
<20-16,ESPOSITO>because this is your future.

565
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,510
<20-16,ESPOSITO>这就是你
<20-16,ESPOSITO>This is you.

566
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,830
<20-17,JOEY>你错了
<20-17,JOEY>You're wrong.

567
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,730
<20-17,JOEY>他不会伤害我
<20-17,JOEY>He won't hurt me.

568
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,450
<20-18,ESPOSITO>他是不会  前提是我们能阻止他
<20-18,ESPOSITO>He won't. Not once we stop him.

569
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,790
<20-18,ESPOSITO>我只要知道他的名字  乔伊
<20-18,ESPOSITO>All I need is his name, Joey.

570
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,930
<20-19,JOEY>我还是不知道你在说些什么
<20-19,JOEY>I still don't know who you're talking about.

571
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,970
<20-19,JOEY>乔伊父母死后我一直是他的社工
<20-19,JOEY>I've been Joey's caseworker since his parents died.

572
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,310
<20-19,JOEY>不用说  这差事不顺利
<20-19,JOEY>Needless to say, it hasn't been smooth sailing,

573
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,960
<20-19,JOEY>但我想象不出他会做这种事
<20-19,JOEY>but I can't imagine he'd do anything like this.

574
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,650
<21-1,BECKETT>我们觉得策划盗窃的另有其人
<21-1,BECKETT>Well, we think that the thefts were someone else's idea.

575
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,830
<21-2,ESPOSITO>你知道谁会
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Do you know of anyone in his life

576
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,230
<21-2,ESPOSITO>让他做这些事吗
<21-2,ESPOSITO>who might have drawn him into this?

577
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,130
<21-2,ESPOSITO>不知道  如果说有这么个人我也不吃惊
<21-2,ESPOSITO>No, but it wouldn't surprise me if there was someone.

578
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,580
<21-3,BECKETT>他的叔叔显然不是个好榜样
<21-3,BECKETT>His uncle's not exactly a strong role model.

579
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,000
<21-3,BECKETT>他叔叔怎么样  他现在在哪
<21-3,BECKETT>What about his uncle? Where is he now?

580
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,310
<21-3,BECKETT>我们正在找他
<21-3,BECKETT>We're trying to track him down.

581
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,010
<21-4,ESPOSITO>他可能在俱乐部  他是扑克玩家
<21-4,ESPOSITO>He may be in A.C. He's a card player.

582
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,550
<21-4,ESPOSITO>这家伙听着真混蛋
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Guy sounds like a real prize.

583
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,400
<21-4,ESPOSITO>你想给这些孩子最好的选择
<21-4,ESPOSITO>You want the best option for these kids.

584
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,380
<21-4,ESPOSITO>但有时你手里却是最差的选择
<21-4,ESPOSITO>And sometimes all you have is the least-bad option.

585
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,980
<21-5,BECKETT>让我想到乔伊的这桩事
<21-5,BECKETT>Which brings me to the issue of what to do with Joey.

586
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,520
<21-5,BECKETT>你们要指控他盗窃吗
<21-5,BECKETT>Are you charging him with theft?

587
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,090
<21-5,BECKETT>希望不会
<21-5,BECKETT>We were hoping not to.

588
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,560
<21-5,BECKETT>那我要把他送去临时寄养
<21-5,BECKETT>So... I'll put him in temporary foster care.

589
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,890
<21-6,ESPOSITO>等等  现在他在那不安全
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's not safe out there in the world right now.

590
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,440
<21-6,ESPOSITO>我们在找的人杀了一名女子
<21-6,ESPOSITO>The guy that we're after killed a woman.

591
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,590
<21-6,ESPOSITO>他会对乔伊做出同样的事
<21-6,ESPOSITO>He could do the same thing to Joey.

592
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,580
<21-6,ESPOSITO>那你可以让他进少教所
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Then you can put him in protective custody

593
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,470
<21-7,ESPOSITO>进行保护性监禁
<21-7,ESPOSITO>in juvenile hall.

594
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,770
<21-7,ESPOSITO>我不能把他丢到少管所
<21-7,ESPOSITO>I-I can't just throw him in juvie.

595
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,260
<21-7,ESPOSITO>我在争取他的信任
<21-7,ESPOSITO>I'm trying to gain his trust here.

596
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,730
<21-8,BECKETT>库珀女士  这小孩是破这宗谋杀案的关键
<21-8,BECKETT>Ms. Cooper, this boy is the key to us solving a murder.

597
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,560
<21-8,BECKETT>很抱歉  可这由不得你
<21-8,BECKETT>Well, I'm sorry, but those are the choices.

598
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,940
<21-9,ESPOSITO>如果我带他走呢
<21-9,ESPOSITO>What if I take him?

599
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,310
<21-10,ESPOSITO>那样的话  他既不用被关起来
<21-10,ESPOSITO>That way, he's not locked up,

600
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,580
<21-10,ESPOSITO>我又能保证他的安全
<21-10,ESPOSITO>and I can keep him safe.

601
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,700
<21-10,ESPOSITO>我还能继续做他的工作
<21-10,ESPOSITO>And I can continue to work on him.

602
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,180
<21-11,BECKETT>怎么样
<21-11,BECKETT>What about that?

603
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,450
<21-11,BECKETT>我...
<21-11,BECKETT>I...

604
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,240
<21-11,BECKETT>我想我可以延后他的报告
<21-11,BECKETT>I suppose I could delay his paperwork,

605
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,030
<21-12,ESPOSITO>但只许这一晚
<21-12,ESPOSITO>but this would be for one night,

606
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,960
<21-12,ESPOSITO>这表示乔伊·马龙由你负责
<21-12,ESPOSITO>and it means that Joey Malone is your responsibility.

607
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,970
<21-12,ESPOSITO>可以  交给我了
<21-12,ESPOSITO>It's cool. I got this.

608
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,400
<21-12,ESPOSITO>这孩子没有爸爸
<21-12,ESPOSITO>The kid doesn't have a father.

609
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,230
<21-12,ESPOSITO>他可能正需要有人沟通
<21-12,ESPOSITO>He probably just needs someone to connect with.

610
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,850
<22-1,JOEY>我宁可和那个女警办睡衣派对
<22-1,JOEY>I'd rather have a pajama party with the lady cop.

611
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,310
<22-2,ESPOSITO>是吗  我倒觉得是我倒霉
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah? Well, it looks like I drew the short straw, literally.

612
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,390
<22-3,JOEY>伙计  难怪你单身
<22-3,JOEY>Man, no wonder you're single.

613
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,520
<22-3,JOEY>没女人愿意待在这里
<22-3,JOEY>No woman would spend time here

614
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
<22-3,JOEY>除非是被强迫的
<22-3,JOEY>unless it was against her will.

615
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,920
<22-4,ESPOSITO>你呢  玛莎·斯图尔特
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, what about you, Martha Stewart?

616
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,190
<22-4,ESPOSITO>你家该是什么样
<22-4,ESPOSITO>What's your place supposed to be,

617
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,230
<22-4,ESPOSITO>破旧时尚风吗  重点号加在破旧上
<22-4,ESPOSITO>shabby chic, emphasis on shabby?

618
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,630
<22-5,JOEY>是不入流  但不是我的错
<22-5,JOEY>It's a dive, but it's not my fault.

619
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,020
<22-5,JOEY>我叔叔宁可把钱都输在赌桌上
<22-5,JOEY>My uncle would rather blow all of his money at the tables.

620
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,820
<22-6,ESPOSITO>那一定是他忙得没空给我们回电的原因了
<22-6,ESPOSITO>Must be why he's too busy to call us back.

621
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,130
<22-7,JOEY>别等电话了
<22-7,JOEY>Don't wait by the phone.

622
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,620
<22-7,JOEY>他抚养我就是为了拿点钱
<22-7,JOEY>He only cares about claiming me as a dependent.

623
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,630
<22-8,ESPOSITO>我父母在我五岁时就离异了
<22-8,ESPOSITO>My parents split up when I was 5.

624
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,760
<22-8,ESPOSITO>伙计  别把腿放在我的桌上
<22-8,ESPOSITO>Man, get your feet off my table.

625
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,490
<22-8,ESPOSITO>老爸和新任妻子搬去了福罗里达
<22-8,ESPOSITO>Dad moved to Florida with his new wife.

626
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,430
<22-8,ESPOSITO>之后就是电话或是明信片联系
<22-8,ESPOSITO>Most I ever got after that was a phone call or a postcard.

627
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,220
<22-10,ESPOSITO>-明信片  -对
<22-10,ESPOSITO>- Postcard? - Yeah.

628
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,730
<22-11,JOEY>你几岁了
<22-11,JOEY>How old are you, anyway?

629
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,840
<22-12,ESPOSITO>很老了  可...
<22-12,ESPOSITO>Ancient, but...

630
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,030
<22-12,ESPOSITO>我那时还太小  印象不深了
<22-12,ESPOSITO>I'm young enough to remember what it was like.

631
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,710
<22-12,ESPOSITO>你一定想念你的家人
<22-12,ESPOSITO>You must miss your folks.

632
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,700
<22-13,JOEY>我爸死后  我妈继续生活
<22-13,JOEY>After my dad died, my mom kept going.

633
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,480
<22-13,JOEY>她试着假装
<22-13,JOEY>You know, she tried to pretend

634
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,380
<22-13,JOEY>我们还是完整家庭
<22-13,JOEY>that we were still a normal family.

635
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,620
<22-13,JOEY>她尽力对我关怀备至
<22-13,JOEY>She did her best to take care of me

636
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,630
<22-13,JOEY>直到
<22-13,JOEY>until...

637
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,880
<22-13,JOEY>她也无能无力
<22-13,JOEY>she couldn't do it anymore.

638
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,380
<22-14,ESPOSITO>现在你自己照顾自己
<22-14,ESPOSITO>Now you take care of yourself.

639
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,250
<22-14,ESPOSITO>对
<22-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

640

<23-14,ESPOSITO>I commandeered this dude's bicycle,

671
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,930
<23-14,ESPOSITO>然后我在地铁把他跟丢了
<23-14,ESPOSITO>and then he lost me in the subway.

672
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,700
<23-14,ESPOSITO>可后来我在下一站抓住了他
<23-14,ESPOSITO>But then I caught him at the next stop.

673
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,140
<23-14,ESPOSITO>他很狡猾
<23-14,ESPOSITO>Kid's wily.

<23-15,RYAN>活脱脱的《法国贩毒网》
<23-15,RYAN>Wow. Just like "The French Connection."

676
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,350
<23-15,RYAN>与此同时  用来裹霍莉尸体的油布
<23-15,RYAN>In the meantime, C.S.U. was able to I.D. those fibers

677
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,630
<23-15,RYAN>鉴证组已经能确认上面的纤维了
<23-15,RYAN>found on the tarp that Holly's body was wrapped in.

678
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,000

<23-17,RYAN>Based on the chemical composition and color,

680
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,060
<23-17,RYAN>是地毯纤维
<23-17,RYAN>they're fibers from carpeting

681
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,720
<23-17,RYAN>被高端欧洲汽车制造商
<23-17,RYAN>used by a high-end European car manufacturer

682
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,170
<23-17,RYAN>用来填车后行李箱的
<23-17,RYAN>to line their vehicles' trunks.

683
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,700
<23-18,ESPOSITO>我们现在知道霍莉的尸体
<23-18,ESPOSITO>Well, now we know how Holly's body

684
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,080
<23-18,ESPOSITO>最后出现在建筑工地
<23-18,ESPOSITO>ended up at that construction site.

685
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,470
<23-19,RYAN>鉴证组已经把范围缩小到2010到2012款X5型号
<23-19,RYAN>C.S.U. narrowed it down to a model 2010 to 2012 X5.

686
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,250
<23-19,RYAN>我会排查建筑工地附近
<23-19,RYAN>I'll canvass around the construction site,

687
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,030
<23-19,RYAN>看看有没有人看到那种车
<23-19,RYAN>see if anyone saw a car like that

688
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,270
<23-19,RYAN>在垃圾车附近出现
<23-19,RYAN>hanging around the dumpster.

689
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,120
<23-20,BECKETT>我们从中心办事处拿到了乔伊的少年犯记录
<23-20,BECKETT>So we pulled Joey's juvie files from the central clerk's office.

690
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,490
<23-21,CASTLE>理论上  任何跟他有瓜葛的人
<23-21,CASTLE>Theory being, whoever he's involved with

691
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,030
<23-21,CASTLE>都记录在这上面
<23-21,CASTLE>might be in there somewhere.

692
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,400
<23-22,BECKETT>除非他把名字告诉你
<23-22,BECKETT>Unless he gave you a name.

693
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,810
<23-23,ESPOSITO>没
<23-23,ESPOSITO>Uh, n-no.

694
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,270
<23-23,ESPOSITO>还没
<23-23,ESPOSITO>Not exactly.

695
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,750
<24-1,BECKETT>我们找到和乔伊打交道的人
<24-1,BECKETT>Look, we find out who Joey got mixed up with,

696
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,770
<24-1,BECKETT>就能找到凶手
<24-1,BECKETT>we find our killer.

697
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,570
<24-1,BECKETT>这些档案里会有线索直指凶手
<24-1,BECKETT>There's gotta be something in these files that points to him.

698
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,650
<24-2,ESPOSITO>他在11岁时
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Looks like he got his first taste

699
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,340
<24-2,ESPOSITO>就尝到了非法闯入的滋味了
<24-2,ESPOSITO>with a B&E when he was 11 years old.

700
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,620
<24-3,BECKETT>12岁时升级到了盗窃
<24-3,BECKETT>Graduated to burglary when he was 12--

701
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,850

<24-3,BECKETT>破门进入一家家庭经营的街头小店
<24-3,BECKETT>along with an identified adult male.

703
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,720
<24-4,CASTLE>或许他就是我们要找的人
<24-4,CASTLE>Maybe he's the one we're looking for.

704
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,900
<24-5,ESPOSITO>不  我们要找的不是这种被抓的笨蛋
<24-5,ESPOSITO>No, we're not looking for someone who he was busted with.

705
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,860
<24-5,ESPOSITO>这家伙够机灵  一直躲在幕后
<24-5,ESPOSITO>This guy's smart enough to stay above it all.

706
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
<24-5,ESPOSITO>看这里
<24-5,ESPOSITO>Check this out.

707
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,410
<24-6,ESPOSITO>两个月前  一个叫肖恩·温特斯的人
<24-6,ESPOSITO>Two months ago, someone named Shane Winters

708
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,600
<24-6,ESPOSITO>在他被控入店行窃后
<24-6,ESPOSITO>bailed him out after he was picked up

709
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,850
<24-6,ESPOSITO>保释他出来
<24-6,ESPOSITO>on a shoplifting charge.

710
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,440
<24-7,BECKETT>肖恩·温特斯  我记得这个名字
<24-7,BECKETT>Shane Winters? I remember that name.

711
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,330
<24-7,BECKETT>死者霍莉·罗兹17岁时
<24-7,BECKETT>When Holly Rhodes, our victim, was 17,

712
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,170
<24-7,BECKETT>她因重偷窃罪被捕
<24-7,BECKETT>she was busted on a grand theft charge.

713
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,930
<24-7,BECKETT>看看是谁签的保释单
<24-7,BECKETT>And check out who posted bail.

714
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,370

<24-7,BECKETT>Shane Winters.

715
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,340
<24-8,CASTLE>就是他了
<24-8,CASTLE>That's our guy.

716
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,610
<24-8,CASTLE>肖恩·温特斯

<25-1,ESPOSITO>这家伙无所不干
<25-1,ESPOSITO>This dude has dabbled in everything.

720
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,540
<25-2,BECKETT>在霍莉还是问题少女时
<25-2,BECKETT>So when Holly was a troubled teen,

721
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
<25-2,BECKETT>一定在为肖恩效命  就跟乔伊一样
<25-2,BECKETT>she must have worked for Shane, just like Joey is.

722
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,680
<25-3,CASTLE>可后来她洗手不干  脱离这样的生活
<25-3,CASTLE>But then she cleaned herself up, got out of the life.

723
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,470
<25-4,ESPOSITO>后来肖恩发现
<25-4,ESPOSITO>Then when Shane figured out

724
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,210
<25-4,ESPOSITO>她能进入各大高端派对
<25-4,ESPOSITO>what kind of access she had at the parties,

725
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,390
<25-4,ESPOSITO>就把她拉了回来
<25-4,ESPOSITO>he pulled her back in.

726
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400
<25-5,BECKETT>这也解释了霍莉
<25-5,BECKETT>Well, that explains why Holly

727
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,250
<25-5,BECKETT>为何会雇佣乔伊做助手
<25-5,BECKETT>had to hire Joey as an assistant.

728
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,440
<25-6,RYAN>刚查了肖恩·温特斯  猜猜他的座驾是什么

730
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,890
<25-7,ESPOSITO>也许里面有在油布上发现的纤维
<25-7,ESPOSITO>That would have the carpet fibers we found on the tarp.

731
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,400
<25-8,CASTLE>是啊  一个任你装尸体的后备箱
<25-8,CASTLE>Yeah, and a roomy trunk for all your body-moving needs.

<26-5,ESPOSITO>You figure you're special to him, don't you?

<26-6,JOEY>你还是不懂
<26-6,JOEY>You don't get it.

743
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,070
<26-6,JOEY>我不会出卖他的
<26-6,JOEY>I'm not giving him up.

744
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,530
<26-7,ESPOSITO>你一直不松口
<26-7,ESPOSITO>You know how much time keeping your mouth shut

745
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,920
<26-7,ESPOSITO>用不了多久
<26-7,ESPOSITO>is gonna buy you with Shane

746
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,470
<26-7,ESPOSITO>肖恩就会掏枪毙了你
<26-7,ESPOSITO>as long as it takes him to pull his gun and shoot you with it.

747
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,360
<26-7,ESPOSITO>然后他会再找另一个像你一样的孩子
<26-7,ESPOSITO>And then he's just gonna move on to the next lost kid.

748
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
<26-7,ESPOSITO>别让事情变成这样  乔伊
<26-7,ESPOSITO>Don't let it end that way, Joey.

749
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
<26-7,ESPOSITO>告诉我他在哪儿
<26-7,ESPOSITO>Just tell me where I can find him.

750
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,170
<26-8,JOEY>我不是叛徒
<26-8,JOEY>I'm not a rat.

751
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,210
<27-1,BECKETT>有收获吗
<27-1,BECKETT>Any luck?

752
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,840
<27-2,ESPOSITO>我真想拧断这小混蛋的脖子
<27-2,ESPOSITO>Man, I just want to wring this little bastard's neck right now.

753
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,090
<27-3,CASTLE>我想是没收获
<27-3,CASTLE>I'm gonna call that a no.

754
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,040
<27-4,BECKETT>我们对肖恩的车发布通缉了
<27-4,BECKETT>So we got a BOLO out on Shane and his car.

755
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,420
<27-5,ESPOSITO>小孩真恐怖啊  老兄
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Freakin' kids, man.

756
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,530
<27-5,ESPOSITO>真不知道你怎么挺过来的
<27-5,ESPOSITO>I don't know how you do it, bro.

757
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,230
<27-6,CASTLE>不不  闺女那么乖是我撞大运了
<27-6,CASTLE>Oh, no, no. I lucked out with Alexis.

758
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,430
<27-6,CASTLE>有时候  你会觉得
<27-6,CASTLE>At a certain point, you realize you're just...

759
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,680
<27-6,CASTLE>我们只是在和生活经验没有我们丰富的人打交道
<27-6,CASTLE>dealing with someone who hasn't been around as long as we have.

760
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,940
<27-6,CASTLE>他们要找到自己的路
<27-6,CASTLE>They have to find their way.

761
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,810
<27-7,ESPOSITO>问题是  他已经找到自己的路了
<27-7,ESPOSITO>The problem is, he's already found his way.

762
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,250
<27-7,ESPOSITO>他只是没看到后果
<27-7,ESPOSITO>He just doesn't see where it's gonna put him.

763
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,880
<27-8,RYAN>还没发现肖恩的车
<27-8,RYAN>Hey, no luck on the BOLO.

764
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,570
<27-8,RYAN>但我和盗窃部的加西亚谈过
<27-8,RYAN>But I talked to Garcia in robbery.

765
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,390
<27-8,RYAN>知道肖恩在哪儿了
<27-8,RYAN>We got a tip on Shane's location.

766
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,440
<27-8,RYAN>你要去吗
<27-8,RYAN>You want to roll?

767
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,580
<27-9,ESPOSITO>这次让我来
<27-9,ESPOSITO>You know what? Let me get this one.

<28-2,BARTENDER>What are you drinking?

772
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,600
<28-3,BODYGUARD>温特斯先生今天不见客
<28-3,BODYGUARD>Mr. Winters is not taking any meetings today.

773
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,540
<28-4,ESPOSITO>能给我拿一袋冰块吗
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Can I just get a bag of ice, please?

774
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,840
<28-5,BARTENDER>你要冰块干什么
<28-5,BARTENDER>What the hell do you want with a bag of ice?

775
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,920

777
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,410
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>你一定是埃斯波西托警探了
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>You must be Detective Esposito.

778
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,640
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>乔伊告诉我你俩在"约会"呢
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>Joey told me you two been hanging out.

779
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,020
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>他说早晚你得找到我这儿来
<28-7,SHANE WINTERS>Said sooner or later, you'd find your way down here.

780
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,520
<28-8,ESPOSITO>他警告你了
<28-8,ESPOSITO>So he warned you.

781

<28-10,ESPOSITO>戴上
<28-10,ESPOSITO>Put 'em on.

783
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,760

<28-10,ESPOSITO>求你别带了
<28-10,ESPOSITO>Please.

<28-11,WINTERS>Some other time, maybe. Huh?

786
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,640
<29-1,RYAN>你认识一个叫霍莉·罗兹的女人吗  肖恩
<29-1,RYAN>Do you know a woman named Holly Rhodes, Shane?

787
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
<29-2,WINTERS>-耳熟  -当然
<29-2,WINTERS>- Name sounds familiar. - Well, it should.

788
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,070
<29-3,ESPOSITO>多年前她跟你混过
<29-3,ESPOSITO>You ran with her back in the day.

789
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,460
<29-4,WINTERS>她是混过  但不是和我一起
<29-4,WINTERS>Oh, she ran, but not with me.

790
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,540
<29-5,ESPOSITO>那她十几岁的时候你为什么保她出来
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Then why did you bail her out when she was a teenager?

791
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,270
<29-6,WINTERS>我就是喜欢小孩儿
<29-6,WINTERS>Well, I got a soft spot for kids, man.

792
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,350
<29-6,WINTERS>是哦
<29-6,WINTERS>Yeah, yeah.

793
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,660
<29-7,RYAN>你就像老好先生
<29-7,RYAN>You're just like a regular Mr. Rogers.

794
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,640
<29-7,RYAN>你最后一次见她是什么时候  肖恩
<29-7,RYAN>When was the last time you saw her, Shane?

795
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,550
<29-8,WINTERS>最后一次见霍莉吗
<29-8,WINTERS>Uh, last time I saw Holly?

796
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,670
<29-8,WINTERS>想不起来了
<29-8,WINTERS>Don't recall.

797
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,290
<29-9,ESPOSITO>让我帮你想想
<29-9,ESPOSITO>Well, let me help you out with that.

798
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,810
<29-9,ESPOSITO>三天之前
<29-9,ESPOSITO>It's three nights ago...

799
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,140
<29-9,ESPOSITO>你杀她的时候
<29-9,ESPOSITO>when you killed her.

800
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,020
<29-10,WINTERS>这你可说错了
<29-10,WINTERS>You're wrong about that.

801
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,370
<29-11,RYAN>我们没说错
<29-11,RYAN>Mm. I don't think so.

802
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,660
<29-11,RYAN>霍莉接的那些DJ演出
<29-11,RYAN>See, when this whole deejaying gig of Holly's took off--

803
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,470
<29-11,RYAN>大把的有钱客户和高级公寓
<29-11,RYAN>wealthy clients, penthouses--

804
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,760
<29-11,RYAN>你看到了一个金灿灿的致富机会
<29-11,RYAN>you saw a golden, diamond-encrusted opportunity.

805
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,250
<29-12,ESPOSITO>于是你就说服霍莉
<29-12,ESPOSITO>And that's when you pressured Holly

806
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,650
<29-12,ESPOSITO>带乔伊·马龙在身边  充当助手
<29-12,ESPOSITO>into bringing in Joey Malone as an assistant.

807
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,630
<29-12,ESPOSITO>他在这些派对上游荡
<29-12,ESPOSITO>He'd go in to these fancy parties,

808
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,890
<29-12,ESPOSITO>拿着价值五十万美元的高档首饰
<29-12,ESPOSITO>and he'd walk right out the front door

809
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,090
<29-12,ESPOSITO>大摇大摆地从大门走出去
<29-12,ESPOSITO>with a half a million in high-end jewelry,

810
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,680
<29-12,ESPOSITO>看起来和你毫无关系
<29-12,ESPOSITO>And your hands would stay clean.

811
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,800
<29-13,WINTERS>最后一句说得对
<29-13,WINTERS>Well, you are right about that part at least.

812
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,490
<29-13,WINTERS>的确和我没关系
<29-13,WINTERS>My hands are clean.

813
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,000
<29-14,ESPOSITO>但是最近一次派对却出了岔子
<29-14,ESPOSITO>But then something went wrong at this last party.

814
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,470
<29-14,ESPOSITO>也许霍莉不想干了
<29-14,ESPOSITO>I mean, maybe Holly pushed back.

815
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,770
<29-14,ESPOSITO>或者她想让你从她生活里永远消失
<29-14,ESPOSITO>Or maybe she wanted you out of her life, once and for all.

816
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,460
<29-15,RYAN>但她知道的太多
<29-15,RYAN>But she knew too much

817
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,240
<29-15,RYAN>她才应该消失
<29-15,RYAN>so she had to go.

818
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,870
<29-16,WINTERS>我听到的都是
<29-16,WINTERS>Look, all I hear you guys saying

819
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,610
<29-16,WINTERS>你们毫无根据的废话
<29-16,WINTERS>is a whole lot of stuff that you can't prove.

820
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,140
<29-17,ESPOSITO>我们能证明她的尸体曾经在你的车里
<29-17,ESPOSITO>Well, we can prove that her body was in your trunk.

821
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,400
<29-18,RYAN>粘在卷霍莉尸体的布料上的纤维
<29-18,RYAN>Fibers stuck to the tarp that Holly was wrapped in

822
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,050
<29-18,RYAN>和你宝马X5里的纤维相匹配
<29-18,RYAN>match your X5.

823
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,220
<29-19,ESPOSITO>我们要扣押你的车
<29-19,ESPOSITO>We're impounding it right now.

824
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,910
<29-20,WINTERS>我想你们可能没听说
<29-20,WINTERS>Wow. Then I guess you guys didn't hear about it--

825
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,990
<29-20,WINTERS>今天早上我的车出了点小问题
<29-20,WINTERS>about the little problem I had with my vehicle this morning.

826
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,700
<29-20,WINTERS>我太不小心了
<29-20,WINTERS>You see, I got a little careless.

827
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,510
<29-20,WINTERS>本来我在点烟
<29-20,WINTERS>I was, uh, I was lighting a cigarette,

828
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,970
<29-20,WINTERS>结果整个车就着火了
<29-20,WINTERS>and next thing I know, whole car catches on fire.

829
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,650
<29-20,WINTERS>里面外面  还有地毯  整个烧得跟薯片似的
<29-20,WINTERS>Inside, outside, the carpet-- whole thing burned to a crisp.

830
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,470
<29-20,WINTERS>我不想扫你们的兴
<29-20,WINTERS>I hate to tell you,

831
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,370
<29-20,WINTERS>不过恐怕已经没有纤维给你们对比了
<29-20,WINTERS>but there's probably not a fiber left to match.

832
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,240
<29-20,WINTERS>太巧了  不是吗
<29-20,WINTERS>Crazy how things happen sometimes, huh?

833
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,660
<29-20,WINTERS>再说一遍
<29-20,WINTERS>So, again,

834
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,600
<29-20,WINTERS>你们说的都是毫无根据的废话
<29-20,WINTERS>whole lot of noise that you can't prove.

835
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,990
<29-20,WINTERS>到这里吧
<29-20,WINTERS>That being said,

836
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,400
<30-2,WINTERS>我要找我的律师
<30-2,WINTERS>I'd like my lawyer.

837
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,270
<29-21,ESPOSITO>你先出去一下
<29-21,ESPOSITO>I need a minute alone.

838
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,550
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你给肖恩通风报信了
<30-1,ESPOSITO>You tipped off Shane.

839
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,020
<30-1,ESPOSITO>昨晚跑了之后
<30-1,ESPOSITO>After you bolted last night,

840
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,290
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你给他打了电话
<30-1,ESPOSITO>you called him.

842
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,570
<30-1,ESPOSITO>好让他有机会烧车
<30-1,ESPOSITO>which gave him a chance to torch his car.

843
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,270
<30-1,ESPOSITO>掩盖他弃尸的罪证
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Cover up his role in Holly's death.

844
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,280
<30-1,ESPOSITO>恭喜你啊  乔伊
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Congratulations, Joey.

845
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,610
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你帮他逃脱了谋杀的指控
<30-1,ESPOSITO>You helped him get away with murder.

846
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,550
<30-1,ESPOSITO>如果有用的话
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Now I'd beat your skinny little ass

847
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,060
<30-1,ESPOSITO>我真想扒了你的裤子打你一顿
<30-1,ESPOSITO>for being so stupid if it'd change anything.

848
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,200
<30-1,ESPOSITO>我想也没用  因为
<30-1,ESPOSITO>But it won't because, well...

849
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,020
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你太忠诚了
<30-1,ESPOSITO>You're so loyal.

850
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,160
<30-1,ESPOSITO>看看肖恩是怎么报答你的
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Now let's see how Shane returns the favor.

851
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,770
<30-2,WINTERS>我看出来了  你反应有点迟钝
<30-2,WINTERS>Look, I can see that you're a little slow,

852
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,740
<30-2,WINTERS>但我刚刚说了"我要找我的律师"
<30-2,WINTERS>but I just said, "I want my lawyer."

853
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,440
<30-3,ESPOSITO>我想跟你谈那些盗窃案
<30-3,ESPOSITO>This is about the thefts.

854
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,150
<30-3,ESPOSITO>总得有人当替罪羊
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Somebody's gonna have to go down for 'em,

855
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,710
<30-3,ESPOSITO>我们也都知道那人会是乔伊·马龙
<30-3,ESPOSITO>and we know it's gonna be Joey Malone.

856
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,760
<30-3,ESPOSITO>地检官想把他当做成年人来起诉
<30-3,ESPOSITO>The D.A. wants to try him as an adult.

857
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,610
<30-3,ESPOSITO>那肯定会蹲上好几年
<30-3,ESPOSITO>That means hard time.

858
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,410
<30-3,ESPOSITO>你还是爷们一点
<30-3,ESPOSITO>All you gotta do is man up.

859
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,430
<30-3,ESPOSITO>承担下来
<30-3,ESPOSITO>Man up about the thefts,

860
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,460
<30-3,ESPOSITO>我就可以去地检官那求情
<30-3,ESPOSITO>and then maybe I can talk to the D.A.

861
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,850
<30-3,ESPOSITO>让他给乔伊减刑
<30-3,ESPOSITO>And get Joey a deal.

862
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,020
<30-4,WINTERS>听着  老兄
<30-4,WINTERS>Look, man,

863
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,760
<30-4,WINTERS>犯了罪  坐牢是应该的
<30-4,WINTERS>If the kid did the crime, he's gotta do the time.

864
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,770
<30-5,ESPOSITO>还要看吗
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Have you seen enough?

865
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,020
<30-5,ESPOSITO>你还想护着他吗
<30-5,ESPOSITO>You still want to protect him?

866
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,510
<30-5,ESPOSITO>我交代
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Look...

867
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,230
<30-6,JOEY>就像你说的
<30-6,JOEY>It was like you said.

868
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,790
<30-6,JOEY>我通常跟着霍莉混进去
<30-6,JOEY>I'd go in with Holly,

869
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,380
<30-6,JOEY>顺走一些昂贵的珠宝
<30-6,JOEY>Lift pricey jewelry,

870
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,020
<30-6,JOEY>顺的越多越好
<30-6,JOEY>The more the better.

871
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,840
<30-6,JOEY>但是这次  有些不一样
<30-6,JOEY>But this time, it was different.

872
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,320
<30-7,ESPOSITO>怎么不一样
<30-7,ESPOSITO>Why?

873
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,390
<30-8,JOEY>肖恩告诉我目标是个音乐制作人
<30-8,JOEY>Shane told me my mark was this music producer,

874
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,570
<30-9,ESPOSITO>-泰瑞斯  -泰瑞斯·威尔顿
<30-9,ESPOSITO>- Tyrese--  -Tyrese Wilton?

875
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,160
<30-10,JOEY>对  就是他  不过很奇怪
<30-10,JOEY>Yeah, him. It was weird.

876
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,660
<30-10,JOEY>我的任务是去偷他的手机
<30-10,JOEY>I was supposed to boost his cell phone.

877
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,470
<30-11,ESPOSITO>为什么要偷他的手机
<30-11,ESPOSITO>Why his cell phone?

878
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,300
<30-12,JOEY>不知道  但我还是偷了
<30-12,JOEY>I don't know, but I took it.

879
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,520
<30-13,ESPOSITO>好吧  然后呢
<30-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and then what?

880
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,270
<30-14,JOEY>不知怎么被霍莉发现了  她很生气
<30-14,JOEY>Somehow Holly found out, and she flipped.

881
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,640
<30-14,JOEY>她找到我让我把手机还回去
<30-14,JOEY>She got in my face and told me to give the phone back.

882
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,800
<30-14,JOEY>我有些害怕  因为我知道她一生气惹不起
<30-14,JOEY>And I got scared because I knew she carried heat,

883
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,490
<30-14,JOEY>但是我已经把手机交给肖恩
<30-14,JOEY>but I had already handed the phone off to Shane.

884
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,990
<30-14,JOEY>所以我就跑了出来
<30-14,JOEY>So I-I got outta there, and...

885
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,750
<30-14,JOEY>那是我最后一次见到她
<30-14,JOEY>That was the last time I saw her.

886
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,720
<30-14,JOEY>我不知道她会被杀死
<30-14,JOEY>I didn't know she would end up dead.

887
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,930
<31-1,BECKETT>我想不到肖恩会杀了她
<31-1,BECKETT>I didn't know Shane would kill her.

888
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,160
<31-1,BECKETT>毫无疑问  像肖恩这种人肯定会杀了她
<31-1,BECKETT>So no doubt a guy like Shane would kill her,

889
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,810
<31-1,BECKETT>但是似乎又不是他杀的
<31-1,BECKETT>but it's starting to look like he didn't.

890
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,770
<31-1,BECKETT>他有不在场证明
<31-1,BECKETT>He's got an alibi.

891
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,640
<31-2,ESPOSITO>我不相信那证据
<31-2,ESPOSITO>I don't believe it.

892
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,580
<31-3,RYAN>六个酒吧的老客户
<31-3,RYAN>Affidavits from six bar patrons,

893
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,250
<31-3,RYAN>在口供里都声称
<31-3,RYAN>all stating that Shane was there

894
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,440
<31-3,RYAN>在11点到12点之间肖恩在酒吧
<31-3,RYAN>between 11:00 and midnight.

895
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,550
<31-4,ESPOSITO>其实他掌管着酒吧
<31-4,ESPOSITO>Well, he practically runs the place,

896
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,150
<31-4,ESPOSITO>他让那些人说什么他们就说什么
<31-4,ESPOSITO>So the patrons will say what he tells 'em.

897
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,850
<31-5,BECKETT>鉴证组刚刚确认了那辆车已完全被焚毁了
<31-5,BECKETT>So C.S.U. just confirmed that his car

898
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,830
<31-5,BECKETT>找不到跟纤维匹配的东西
<31-5,BECKETT>was too burned for them to match the fibers

899
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,870
<31-5,BECKETT>也无法取证
<31-5,BECKETT>or pull forensics.

900
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,240
<31-5,BECKETT>所以说我们甚至无法证明他那辆车运过尸体
<31-5,BECKETT>So we can't even prove that he transported the vic's body.

901
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,230
<31-6,RYAN>我们也无法把凶器跟他扯上关系
<31-6,RYAN>We also can't tie the murder weapon to him either.

902
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,050
<31-6,RYAN>根据她的助理保罗所说
<31-6,RYAN>According to her assistant Paul,

903
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,840
<31-6,RYAN>霍莉通常携带一把点38口径的手枪自卫
<31-6,RYAN>Holly used to carry around a .380 pistol for protection.

904
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
<31-6,RYAN>她可能是被自己的枪所杀害的
<31-6,RYAN>She might have been killed with her own gun.

905
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,610
<31-7,CASTLE>这说不通
<31-7,CASTLE>Here's something that doesn't add up--

906
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,970
<31-7,CASTLE>泰瑞斯·威尔顿的手机
<31-7,CASTLE>Tyrese Wilton's phone.

907
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,620
<31-7,CASTLE>为什么肖恩要让乔伊
<31-7,CASTLE>Why would Shane tell Joey

908
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,800
<31-7,CASTLE>去偷一部只值几百块钱的手机呢
<31-7,CASTLE>to steal a phone worth a couple of hundred bucks?

909
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,040
<31-7,CASTLE>况且是在一个有亮晃晃珠宝的派对上
<31-7,CASTLE>Especially when there had to be so much bling at that party.

910
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,460
<31-8,ESPOSITO>哥们  现在都不说"亮晃晃"了  那叫"闪瞎眼"
<31-8,ESPOSITO>Dude, nobody says "bling" anymore. Try "shine."

911
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,810
<31-9,RYAN>还有件事说不通
<31-9,RYAN>There's something else that doesn't add up.

912
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,200
<31-9,RYAN>我们联系了所有的来宾
<31-9,RYAN>All the guests were contacted and asked

913
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,890
<31-9,RYAN>并询问他们是否丢失了什么个人物品
<31-9,RYAN>if they were missing any personal items.

914
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,300
<31-9,RYAN>他们都说没有  那么
<31-9,RYAN>They all said no, so--

915
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,920
<31-10,BECKETT>为什么泰瑞斯·威尔顿没有说
<31-10,BECKETT>Why didn't Tyrese Wilton mention

916
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,590
<31-10,BECKETT>他的手机不见了呢
<31-10,BECKETT>that his phone was gone?

917
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,830
<32-1,ESPOSITO>看看这个  杨氏王朝
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Check this out. "Yang Dynasty."

918
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,770
<32-2,RYAN>这可能是霍莉衣服上有花生油的原因
<32-2,RYAN>Could explain the peanut oil on Holly's clothes.

919
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,550
<32-3,ESPOSITO>墙上有飞溅的血迹
<32-3,ESPOSITO>There's blood spatter on the wall.

920
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,420
<32-4,RYAN>看来我们找到了犯罪现场
<32-4,RYAN>Looks like we found our crime scene.

921
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,170
<32-5,ESPOSITO>是的  就在泰瑞斯的门口
<32-5,ESPOSITO>Yep, and it's right at Tyrese's doorstep.

922
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,740
<33-1,TYRESE>你是说霍莉是在我工作室的门口遇害的吗
<33-1,TYRESE>Are you saying that Holly was killed just outside my studio?

923
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,710
<33-1,TYRESE>没错
<33-1,TYRESE>That's right.

924
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,430
<33-2,ESPOSITO>你还是告诉我们她在干什么吧
<33-2,ESPOSITO>So why don't you tell us what she was doing here?

925
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,140
<33-3,TYRESE>我怎么知道
<33-3,TYRESE>How the hell should I know?

926
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,450
<33-4,RYAN>那么  你就告诉我们
<33-4,RYAN>Mm. Well, then maybe you can tell us

927
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,960
<33-4,RYAN>派对那天的11点到12点之间
<33-4,RYAN>what you were doing between 11:00 and midnight

928
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,730
<33-4,RYAN>你在做什么吧
<33-4,RYAN>the night of the party.

929
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,920
<33-5,TYRESE>我就在派对上
<33-5,TYRESE>I was at the party.

930
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,620
<33-5,TYRESE>我一直待到1点多
<33-5,TYRESE>I stayed there till just after 1:00.

931
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,270
<33-5,TYRESE>你可以去查
<33-5,TYRESE>You can check.

932
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,120
<33-6,ESPOSITO>你被询问过在那天晚上
<33-6,ESPOSITO>You were also asked if any of your stuff went missing

933
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,200
<33-6,ESPOSITO>是否丢过东西
<33-6,ESPOSITO>the night of the party.

934
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,290
<33-6,ESPOSITO>你没有提及你丢了的手机
<33-6,ESPOSITO>You didn't mention your phone.

935
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,810
<33-7,TYRESE>那是因为我的手机没丢
<33-7,TYRESE>Because my phone wasn't missing.

936
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,890
<33-8,ESPOSITO>你没必要跟我说谎  泰瑞斯
<33-8,ESPOSITO>You don't have to lie to me, Tyrese.

937
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,010
<33-8,ESPOSITO>我跟偷手机的那个孩子谈过了
<33-8,ESPOSITO>I talked to the kid who stole it.

938
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,750
<33-9,TYRESE>我是说  我的手机是不见了一两个小时
<33-9,TYRESE>I mean, it was missing for an hour or two,

939
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,660
<33-9,TYRESE>但是最后又出现了
<33-9,TYRESE>but then it turned up.

940
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,280
<33-9,TYRESE>看见了吗  派对结束时我在洗手间里找到的
<33-9,TYRESE>See? I found it in the bathroom at the end of the night.

941
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,470
<33-10,RYAN>要是手机被乔伊偷了
<33-10,RYAN>If Joey stole the phone,

942
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,710
<33-10,RYAN>怎么会又出现在晚会上呢
<33-10,RYAN>how'd it end up back at the party?

943
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,620
<33-11,ESPOSITO>把手机还回来的人不想让人发现它不见了
<33-11,ESPOSITO>Whoever brought that back didn't want it missed.

944
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,860
<33-11,ESPOSITO>根据肖恩的一贯手法
<33-11,ESPOSITO>Based on Shane's M.O.,

945
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,270
<33-11,ESPOSITO>他的目标是有价值的东西  能卖钱的东西
<33-11,ESPOSITO>he was after something valuable, something he could sell.

946
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,130
<33-11,ESPOSITO>泰瑞斯  你手机里有什么
<33-11,ESPOSITO>Yo, Tyrese, what's on that phone--

947
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,620
<33-11,ESPOSITO>财务信息  照片  有价值的资料之类的
<33-11,ESPOSITO>Financial info, pictures, valuable data?

948
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,420
<33-12,TYRESE>有样东西很重要
<33-12,TYRESE>Only one thing that really matters--

949
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,020
<33-12,TYRESE>这部手机还是一把电子钥匙
<33-12,TYRESE>I use this phone as an e-key.

950
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,240
<33-13,ESPOSITO>电子钥匙
<33-13,ESPOSITO>An e-key?

951
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,100
<33-14,TYRESE>可以进入工作室的电子钥匙
<33-14,TYRESE>An electronic key. It opens up this studio.

952
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,740
<33-15,RYAN>霍莉知道这个吗
<33-15,RYAN>Well, did Holly know that?

953
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,840
<33-16,TYRESE>是的  当我发现手机不见时我跟她说起过
<33-16,TYRESE>Yeah, I mentioned it to her when I discovered it was gone.

954
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,040
<33-16,TYRESE>我本来要用短信发给她我的号码
<33-16,TYRESE>I went to text her my number,

955
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,970
<33-16,TYRESE>但手机不见了  我只好写在她手上
<33-16,TYRESE>But I had to write it on her hand instead.

956
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,390
<33-17,RYAN>这就是为什么霍莉来这的原因
<33-17,RYAN>That's why Holly was here.

957
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,200
<33-17,RYAN>她意识到肖恩偷这部手机
<33-17,RYAN>She realized that Shane stole the phone

958
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,700
<33-17,RYAN>是因为他要盗窃这件工作室
<33-17,RYAN>because he was gonna rip the studio off.

959
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,670
<33-18,ESPOSITO>她想要阻止这件事
<33-18,ESPOSITO>She couldn't let that happen,

960
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,450
<33-18,ESPOSITO>因为泰瑞斯要用这里让她出名
<33-18,ESPOSITO>not with Tyrese here about to give her big break.

961
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,600
<33-19,RYAN>对  所以她赶在你的东西被偷前
<33-19,RYAN>Right, so she races over here to confront Shane

962
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,380
<33-19,RYAN>来到这里跟肖恩对质
<33-19,RYAN>to stop him before he ripped you off.

963
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,400
<33-20,TYRESE>看来她做到了  因为什么东西也没丢
<33-20,TYRESE>Looks like she did, because nothing's missing.

964
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,420
<33-21,ESPOSITO>你确定
<33-21,ESPOSITO>You sure?

965
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,340
<33-22,TYRESE>当然了  我这有价值两百多万的设备
<33-22,TYRESE>Positive. I got over $2 mil in equipment here.

966
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,330
<33-22,TYRESE>什么也
<33-22,TYRESE>And nothing...

967
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,300
<33-22,TYRESE>天啊
<33-22,TYRESE>Oh, god.

968
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,650
<33-24,TYRESE>-怎么了  -那些录音
<33-24,TYRESE>- What?  - The recordings.

969
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,140
<33-24,TYRESE>如果有人拿到了还没发行的专辑
<33-24,TYRESE>If someone got their hands on an unreleased album...

970
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
<33-25,ESPOSITO>那他就发达了
<33-25,ESPOSITO>It'd be worth a fortune.

971
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,210
<33-26,TYRESE>更不用说如果发布在网上  会严重影响销量
<33-26,TYRESE>Not to mention tanking our record sales if it leaked online.

972
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,850
<33-27,TYRESE>不  乔茜·朗的专辑文件
<33-27,TYRESE>Oh, no. Josie Lang's album

973
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,720
<33-27,TYRESE>在那天晚上的11点45被访问过
<33-27,TYRESE>was accessed at 11:45 the night of the party.

974
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,220
<33-27,TYRESE>有人下载过
<33-27,TYRESE>Someone downloaded the masters.

975
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,600
<33-28,ESPOSITO>肖恩干的
<33-28,ESPOSITO>Shane.

976
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,070
<34-1,BECKETT>我再说一遍  肖恩的不在场证据很充分
<34-1,BECKETT>Look, I'm telling you, Shane's alibi is rock-solid.

977
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,070
<34-2,ESPOSITO>这怎么可能
<34-2,ESPOSITO>How is that even possible?

978
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,360
<34-3,BECKETT>我们询问了酒吧里的每一个人
<34-3,BECKETT>We interviewed everyone in the bar.

979
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,960
<34-3,BECKETT>甚至还问了酒吧外的出租车司机
<34-3,BECKETT>We even talked to the cabbies outside,

980
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,720
<34-3,BECKETT>所有人都说他是在12点左右离开的
<34-3,BECKETT>and everyone said that he left around midnight.

981
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,840
<34-4,ESPOSITO>如果他没用他的车弃尸
<34-4,ESPOSITO>Why would he torch his car

982
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,150
<34-4,ESPOSITO>那他为什么要把它烧了呢
<34-4,ESPOSITO>if he didn't use it to dump her body?

983
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,270
<34-5,BECKETT>丢弃尸体的可能是他
<34-5,BECKETT>He might have dumped the body,

984
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,950
<34-5,BECKETT>但是时间线表明他不是凶手
<34-5,BECKETT>But our timeline says that he did not kill her.

985
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,200
<34-6,ESPOSITO>天啊
<34-6,ESPOSITO>Man.

986
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,700
<34-7,RYAN>等  等一下  我们  我们
<34-7,RYAN>W-wait a minute. We--we--

987
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,880
<34-7,RYAN>我们一定是遗漏了什么
<34-7,RYAN>we gotta be missing something here.

988
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,270
<34-7,RYAN>让我们再梳理一遍
<34-7,RYAN>So let's just go over it again.

989
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,160
<34-7,RYAN>我们知道乔伊在11点左右把手机交给肖恩
<34-7,RYAN>We know that Joey handed Shane that phone around 11:00.

990
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,490
<34-7,RYAN>还知道乔茜的专辑是在11点45被下载的
<34-7,RYAN>And we know that Josie's album was downloaded at 11:45.

991
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,710
<34-7,RYAN>而霍莉是在11点到12点之间被杀的
<34-7,RYAN>Holly was murdered sometime between 11:00 and midnight.

992
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,760
<34-8,CASTLE>等一下
<34-8,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

993
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,170
<34-8,CASTLE>整件事的关键就是那部手机
<34-8,CASTLE>The key to this whole thing is that phone.

994
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,080
<34-8,CASTLE>我们假设是肖恩
<34-8,CASTLE>We're assuming that Shane

995
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,760
<34-8,CASTLE>利用手机进入了工作室
<34-8,CASTLE>was the one who used it to break in to the studio.

996
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,170
<34-9,ESPOSITO>因为乔伊把手机交给了他
<34-9,ESPOSITO>Because he's the one that Joey gave the phone to.

997
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:39,240
<34-10,CASTLE>对  但是证人说11点半到12他都在酒吧里
<34-10,CASTLE>Right, but witnesses place him at the bar, 11:30 to midnight.

998
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,990
<34-10,CASTLE>而工作室里的专辑是在11点45被下载的
<34-10,CASTLE>The album was downloaded at the studio at 11:45.

999
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,210
<34-10,CASTLE>-这一定是另一个人干的  -谁呢
<34-10,CASTLE>- It had to be someone else.  - Like who?

1000
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,780
<34-12,CASTLE>一定是晚会上的某个人
<34-12,CASTLE>Well, it had to be someone from the party.

1001
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,660
<34-13,BECKETT>进入到工作室的这个人
<34-13,BECKETT>So then whoever broke in to the studio

1002
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,950
<34-13,BECKETT>必须得把手机还回去
<34-13,BECKETT>must have returned the phone to the party

1003
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,640
<34-13,BECKETT>这样泰瑞斯才不会发现手机被偷了
<34-13,BECKETT>so that Tyrese wouldn't realize that it was even taken.

1004
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,540
<34-14,CASTLE>我们要做的就是找出
<34-14,CASTLE>All we have to do is figure out

1005
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,780
<34-14,CASTLE>哪一位来宾能够通过
<34-14,CASTLE>which one of the guests had something to gain

1006
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,500
<34-14,CASTLE>盗取乔茜的专辑获利
<34-14,CASTLE>from stealing Josie's album.

1007
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,660
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>一二  五六  七八
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>One, two. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1008
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,010
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>一  二  三  四
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>Rock one, two, three, four.

1009
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,460
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>伸脚  很好
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>Step. Nice. Good.

1010
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,640
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>踮脚
<35-1,DANCE INSTRUCTOR>Point again.

1011
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,740
<35-2,REGINA>你们拿到我们
<35-2,REGINA>Did you guys not get

1012
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,600
<35-2,REGINA>发过去的宾客名单了吗
<35-2,REGINA>the guest list that we sent over?

1013
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,190
<35-3,BECKETT>拿到了
<35-3,BECKETT>Yeah, we... we did.

1014
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,520
<35-3,BECKETT>我们想要问问
<35-3,BECKETT>We just need to ask you a few questions

1015
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,810
<35-3,BECKETT>派对当晚你的行程
<35-3,BECKETT>about your schedule the night of the party.

1016
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,410
<35-4,REGINA>好啊
<35-4,REGINA>Yeah, sure.

1017
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,450
<35-5,BECKETT>根据你的派对策划人所说
<35-5,BECKETT>So according to your party planner,

1018
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,970
<35-5,BECKETT>你在11点消失了一段时间
<35-5,BECKETT>you excused yourself at 11:00 to do a costume change

1019
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,140
<35-5,BECKETT>换衣服准备表演新专辑曲目
<35-5,BECKETT>for a performance of a track from your new album.

1020
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,000
<35-5,BECKETT>是这样吗
<35-5,BECKETT>Is that correct?

1021
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,260
<35-6,REGINA>没错
<35-6,REGINA>That sounds about right,

1022
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,980
<35-6,REGINA>但是他们让我去哪儿我就去哪儿
<35-6,REGINA>but I just go where they tell me to.

1023
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,850
<35-6,REGINA>你们懂的
<35-6,REGINA>You know how it is.

1024
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,440
<35-7,CASTLE>不过策划人告诉我们你坚持
<35-7,CASTLE>Only your planner told us that you insisted

1025
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,660
<35-7,CASTLE>准备一整个小时
<35-7,CASTLE>on having a full hour.

1026
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,670
<35-8,REGINA>你们试穿过紧身皮裤吗
<35-8,REGINA>Have you ever tried changing into skintight leather pants?

1027
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,030
<35-8,REGINA>相当费时间
<35-8,REGINA>It's time-consuming.

1028
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,590
<35-9,REGINA>为什么问这些
<35-9,REGINA>Why? What's-- what's the point?

1029
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,330
<35-10,BECKETT>这一小时给了你足够的时间
<35-10,BECKETT>Well, that hour gave you enough time

1030
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,410
<35-10,BECKETT>前去泰瑞斯·威尔顿的工作室
<35-10,BECKETT>to get to Tyrese Wilton's studio,

1031
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,140
<35-10,BECKETT>下载乔茜的新专辑
<35-10,BECKETT>download Josie's new album,

1032
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,700
<35-10,BECKETT>再赶回派对表演歌曲
<35-10,BECKETT>and get back to the party to perform your song.

1033
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,640
<35-11,REGINA>你疯了吗
<35-11,REGINA>Are you insane?

1034
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,790
<35-11,REGINA>我干嘛要那么做
<35-11,REGINA>Why would I do anything like that?

1035
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,470
<35-12,CASTLE>因为这几年你的专辑销量下滑得厉害
<35-12,CASTLE>Because your album sales have been sagging for years.

1036
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,040
<35-13,BECKETT>如果这张还是没能热卖
<35-13,BECKETT>If your album didn't perform,

1037
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,760
<35-13,BECKETT>你的公司会与你解约
<35-13,BECKETT>your record label was gonna drop you.

1038
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,290
<35-14,REGINA>我跟和音360公司合作十年了
<35-14,REGINA>I've been with Harmony 360 for 10 years.

1039
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,060
<35-14,REGINA>他们爱我
<35-14,REGINA>They love me.

1040
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,950
<35-15,BECKETT>乔茜·朗比你红不是什么秘密
<35-15,BECKETT>It's no secret that Josie Lang's eclipsed you.

1041
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,290
<35-16,REGINA>得了  她才出道几天啊
<35-16,REGINA>Oh, please. She's been around for two seconds.

1042
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,710
<35-16,REGINA>一年后  没人会记得她的名字
<35-16,REGINA>Give it a year, you won't even remember her name.

1043
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,690
<35-17,CASTLE>那无所谓
<35-17,CASTLE>It doesn't matter.

1044
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,470
<35-17,CASTLE>你们的专辑下周同时发行
<35-17,CASTLE>Both your albums come out next week,

1045
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,820
<35-17,CASTLE>她的专辑卖得肯定比你好
<35-17,CASTLE>and she's going to crush you.

1046
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,060
<35-18,BECKETT>除非有人在网上泄露乔茜的专辑
<35-18,BECKETT>Unless someone mysteriously leaks josie's new album online.

1047
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,810
<35-19,CASTLE>你的计划很简单
<35-19,CASTLE>Your plan was simple--

1048
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,640
<35-19,CASTLE>雇肖恩偷手机
<35-19,CASTLE>Hire Shane to steal the phone,

1049
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,280
<35-19,CASTLE>那样你就能进入工作室
<35-19,CASTLE>that way, you can get in to the studio.

1050
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,160
<35-20,BECKETT>你没想到的是霍莉出现了
<35-20,BECKETT>The one thing that you didn't plan on was Holly.

1051
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,430
<35-20,BECKETT>她在你要离开工作室的时候
<35-20,BECKETT>She showed up and caught you

1052
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,030
<35-20,BECKETT>把你抓了个正着
<35-20,BECKETT>just as you were leaving the studio.

1053
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,760
<35-21,CASTLE>你怕她曝光你
<35-21,CASTLE>You couldn't risk her exposing you.

1054
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,710
<35-21,CASTLE>你们扭打起来
<35-21,CASTLE>You fought.

1055
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,540
<35-21,CASTLE>她掏出枪自卫
<35-21,CASTLE>She pulled out her gun to protect herself,

1056
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,300
<35-21,CASTLE>但是你最终用那把枪杀了她
<35-21,CASTLE>but you managed to use it on her instead.

1057
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,180
<35-22,BECKETT>于是你给肖恩打电话
<35-22,BECKETT>So you called Shane

1058
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,570
<35-22,BECKETT>让他帮你处理尸体
<35-22,BECKETT>and you got him to get rid of the body.

1059
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,180
<35-23,REGINA>开什么玩笑  那都是猜测
<35-23,REGINA>Are you kidding me? That's all speculation.

1060
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,810
<35-24,BECKETT>有件事不是猜测  你雇了DJ比特
<35-24,BECKETT>The one thing that's not speculation is that you hired D.J. Beat.

1061
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,030
<35-24,BECKETT>你是怎么知道她的
<35-24,BECKETT>How'd you find out about her?

1062
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,960
<35-25,REGINA>口口相传
<35-25,REGINA>Word of mouth.

1063
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,610
<35-26,BECKETT>别扯了  你的保镖跟肖恩是发小
<35-26,BECKETT>More like your bodyguard grew up with Shane Winters.

1064
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,520
<35-26,BECKETT>肖恩让你雇霍莉
<35-26,BECKETT>Shane had you hire d.J. Beat

1065
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,790
<35-26,BECKETT>这样乔伊就能进来偷手机了
<35-26,BECKETT>So that Joey could get in and steal that phone.

1066
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,320
<35-27,CASTLE>还有一件事不是猜测
<35-27,CASTLE>You know what else isn't speculation?

1067
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,650
<35-27,CASTLE>她在你网络提供商上使用的许可
<35-27,CASTLE>The warrant she served on your I.S.P.

1068
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,140
<35-28,BECKETT>透露了一个邮件账号  是你创建的
<35-28,BECKETT>that warrant revealed the e-mail account that you created

1069
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,140
<35-28,BECKETT>用来与泄露乔茜专辑的黑客联系
<35-28,BECKETT>to communicate with the hacker that was going to leak josie's new album online.

1070
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,480
<35-28,BECKETT>这些证据够了吗
<35-28,BECKETT>Is that enough fact for you?

1071
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,780
<35-29,REGINA>我的专辑销量也许下滑了
<35-29,REGINA>My record sales may be down,

1072
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,340
<35-29,REGINA>但我至少还是请得起好律师的
<35-29,REGINA>but I can still afford a damn good lawyer.

1073
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,210
<36-1,WINTERS>你总是出现
<36-1,WINTERS>You keep showing up here like this,

1074
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,140
<36-1,WINTERS>我的手下会以为你喜欢我的
<36-1,WINTERS>My boys are gonna think you're sweet on me.

1075
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,420
<36-2,ESPOSITO>不会了
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Not anymore, they won't.

1076
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,130
<36-2,ESPOSITO>你现在可是窃盗重罪的嫌疑人
<36-2,ESPOSITO>You are walking on grand larceny and accessory after the fact.

1077
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,250
<36-2,ESPOSITO>那种运气延续不了多长时间
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Wow. Now that kind of luck does not last long.

1078
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,060
<36-3,WINTERS>看来今晚我得买彩票去了
<36-3,WINTERS>Well, I guess I gotta go play the powerball, then, tonight.

1079
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,180
<36-4,ESPOSITO>这是我的枪
<36-4,ESPOSITO>This is my gun.

1080
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,420
<36-4,ESPOSITO>这把是你的
<36-4,ESPOSITO>And this one will be yours.

1081
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,270
<36-4,ESPOSITO>你要是再接近乔伊和其他孩子
<36-4,ESPOSITO>You ever go near Joey or any other kid ever again,

1082
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,160
<36-4,ESPOSITO>事情会这样发生
<36-4,ESPOSITO>The story's gonna go like this--

1083
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,000
<36-4,ESPOSITO>你袭击我
<36-4,ESPOSITO>you pulled that piece on me.

1084
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,250
<36-4,ESPOSITO>然后
<36-4,ESPOSITO>And...

1085
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,490
<36-4,ESPOSITO>我自卫
<36-4,ESPOSITO>I had to defend myself, so...

1086
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,520
<36-4,ESPOSITO>杀了你
<36-4,ESPOSITO>I killed you.

1087
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,700
<36-4,ESPOSITO>明白了吗
<36-4,ESPOSITO>You understand me?

1088
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,270
<36-4,ESPOSITO>还是说你想演这出戏
<36-4,ESPOSITO>Or should we play out that story

1089
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,520
<36-4,ESPOSITO>在这
<36-4,ESPOSITO>right here,

1090

1091
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,380
<36-5,WINTERS>我听见了
<36-5,WINTERS>I hear you.

<37-4,JOEY>Look, haven't I done enough to solve this case for you?

<37-11,ESPOSITO>什么事都得干
<37-11,ESPOSITO>what you had to do to survive.

1110

<37-11,ESPOSITO>不是每个人都撑过来了
<37-11,ESPOSITO>Not everybody made it.

<37-13,ESPOSITO>Saw a future in me that I didn't even see in myself.

1117
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,510
<37-13,ESPOSITO>但最终是由我来做出选择
<37-13,ESPOSITO>But it was up to me to make the choice,

1118
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,210
<37-13,ESPOSITO>走哪条路
<37-13,ESPOSITO>to pick which road to go down.
