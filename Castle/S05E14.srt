00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,400
<4-6,BECKETT>你知不知道拍摄后她去了哪里
<4-6,BECKETT>Do you know where she went after filming

116
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
<4-6,BECKETT>或是她为什么去曼哈顿西区
<4-6,BECKETT>or why she would've been on the upper west side?

117
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,890
<4-7,PETER>说实话  摄像机下班
<4-7,PETER>Well, to be honest, when the cameras go away,

118
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,850
<4-7,PETER>我也下班
<4-7,PETER>so do I.

119
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,820
<4-7,PETER>所以我根本不知道她平时做些什么
<4-7,PETER>So I don't even know what she did on her free time.

120
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,940
<4-8,CASTLE>她在录像里似乎很生气  是什么原因
<4-8,CASTLE>In the video, she seems upset. Any idea what about?

121
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,250
<4-9,PETER>你们得知道
<4-9,PETER>Oh, you gotta understand,

122
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,870
<4-9,PETER>汉娜是作为佩内洛普的助手进入节目的
<4-9,PETER>we brought Hannah in to be Penelope's assistant.

123
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,160
<4-9,PETER>我们得增加些戏剧化情节
<4-9,PETER>You know, to mix things up a little bit.

124
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,000
<4-9,PETER>小镇姑娘有想做时装设计师的
<4-9,PETER>The small-town girl with the big-time dreams

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,570
<4-9,PETER>远大理想
<4-9,PETER>of becoming a fashion designer.

126
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,830
<4-9,PETER>她会在《华尔街之妻》节目中成功吗
<4-9,PETER>Will she make it with the wives of wall street?

127
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,440
<4-9,PETER>她只是在镜头前夸张演出
<4-9,PETER>She's just milking it for the camera.

128
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,520
<4-9,PETER>演员都是这样
<4-9,PETER>They all do.

129
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,680
<4-10,CASTLE>所以这是完全不真实的真人秀
<4-10,CASTLE>So it's a reality show, just without the reality.

130
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,390
<4-11,PETER>我倾向于认为这是高于现实
<4-11,PETER>I like to think of it as heightened reality.

131
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,470
<4-11,PETER>有着现实味道的
<4-11,PETER>Reality-ish.

132
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,050
<4-12,BECKETT>在真正的现实中
<4-12,BECKETT>In real reality,

133
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,010
<4-12,BECKETT>她与节目组的人有矛盾吗
<4-12,BECKETT>did she have problems with anyone on the show?

134
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,660
<4-13,PETER>你把一帮女强人放在一起
<4-13,PETER>Well, you put a bunch of tough-minded women together,

135
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,320
<4-13,PETER>哪有不吵架的
<4-13,PETER>you're gonna get a spat or two.

136
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,070
<4-13,PETER>但汉娜是摄制组家庭的一员
<4-13,PETER>But Hannah was part of the family.

137
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,730
<4-14,BECKETT>好吧  我需要她所有的影带
<4-14,BECKETT>Okay, well, I'm gonna need all of her tapes

138
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,310
<4-14,BECKETT>以防其中有线索
<4-14,BECKETT>just in case there's something relevant.

139
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,110
<4-14,BECKETT>没问题
<4-14,BECKETT>Of course.

140
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,800
<4-15,PETER>不过  你应该查查她真正的家人
<4-15,PETER>Although, you might want to check out her own family.

141
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,510
<4-15,PETER>我知道她跟她哥哥查理·格林关系不好
<4-15,PETER>I know that she had trouble with her brother--Charlie Green.

142
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,450
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>汉娜总想在大城市一举成名
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>Hannah always wanted to make it big in the city,

143
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,040
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>她来到这里时
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>and when she came here, she, uh,

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>她迷失了方向
<5-1,CHARLIE GREEN>she lost her way.

145
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,580
<5-2,CHARLIE>我本该多做点什么
<5-2,CHARLIE>I should've done more.

146
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,670
<5-2,CHARLIE>我是她哥哥  我本该保护她的
<5-2,CHARLIE>I was her brother. I should've protected her.

147
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,690
<5-3,RYAN>格林先生
<5-3,RYAN>Mr. Green,

148
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,760
<5-3,RYAN>你最后一次跟汉娜说话是什么时候
<5-3,RYAN>when was the last time you talked to Hannah?

149
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,450
<5-4,CHARLIE>几天前
<5-4,CHARLIE>Uh, a few days ago.

150
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,490
<5-4,CHARLIE>我打给她  吵了起来
<5-4,CHARLIE>I called her. We fought.

151
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,420
<5-5,ESPOSITO>吵什么
<5-5,ESPOSITO>About what?

152
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,010
<5-6,CHARLIE>还是那些事
<5-6,CHARLIE>The usual.

153
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,340
<5-6,CHARLIE>她就那么把自己的生活
<5-6,CHARLIE>About how she was putting her life out there

154
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,520
<5-6,CHARLIE>袒露在全世界面前
<5-6,CHARLIE>for the world to see,

155
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,310
<5-6,CHARLIE>这样会对这个家造成的影响
<5-6,CHARLIE>what it was doing to the family.

156
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,600
<5-6,CHARLIE>她
<5-6,CHARLIE>She...

157
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,650
<5-6,CHARLIE>她说我不理解
<5-6,CHARLIE>She said I didn't understand,

158
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,380
<5-6,CHARLIE>这里面的内幕远比我知道的多
<5-6,CHARLIE>that there was more going on than I knew.

159
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,280
<5-6,CHARLIE>但对我来说  很简单  她需要回家
<5-6,CHARLIE>But to me, it was simple-- she needed to come home.

160
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,820
<5-7,RYAN>这么说  你并不赞成她
<5-7,RYAN>So... you didn't approve of her

161
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,360
<5-7,RYAN>上《华尔街之妻》吗
<5-7,RYAN>being on "the wives of wall street"?

162
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,270
<5-7,RYAN>赞同
<5-7,RYAN>Approve?

163
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,190
<5-8,CHARLIE>不  我们难过死了
<5-8,CHARLIE>No, it was killing us...

164
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,040
<5-8,CHARLIE>看她做的那些选择  看她过着不堪的生活
<5-8,CHARLIE>To see the choices she made, the way she was living her life,

165
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,280
<5-8,CHARLIE>一切都被录下来全国播放
<5-8,CHARLIE>all of it out there on national television.

166
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,510
<5-8,CHARLIE>那还是在她跟人搞外遇之前
<5-8,CHARLIE>And that was before she started having the affair.

167
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,330
<5-9,ESPOSITO>外遇
<5-9,ESPOSITO>Affair?

168
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,110
<6-1,PENELOPE>你睡了我老公  还腆着脸回来工作
<6-1,PENELOPE>You screw my husband, you think you're welcome here?

169
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,820
<6-2,HANNAH>他选择了我  佩内洛普
<6-2,HANNAH>He chose me, penelope.

170
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,130
<6-2,HANNAH>接受现实吧
<6-2,HANNAH>Deal with it.

171
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,820
<6-3,PENELOPE>我不会放过你的
<6-3,PENELOPE>I am coming for you.

172
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,440
<6-4,BECKETT>这么说被害人跟真人秀中
<6-4,BECKETT>So our victim was sleeping with the husband

173
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,210
<6-4,BECKETT>另一个女人的丈夫上床了吗
<6-4,BECKETT>of one of the other women in the show?

174
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,270
<6-5,ESPOSITO>不仅是上床
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Not just sleeping with.

175
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,630
<6-5,ESPOSITO>被佩内洛普抓奸之后
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Hannah and Bob moved in together

176
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,210
<6-5,ESPOSITO>汉娜和鲍勃同居了
<6-5,ESPOSITO>after Penelope found out about them.

177
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,680
<6-6,BECKETT>可是节目制作人却只字未提
<6-6,BECKETT>And yet the show's pducer said nothing about it.

178
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,220
<6-7,CASTLE>要我说他是为了保全自己
<6-7,CASTLE>I'd say he was covering his own asset.

179
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,260
<6-8,BECKETT>这场外遇在全国播放
<6-8,BECKETT>This affair was broadcast on national television.

180
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,490
<6-8,BECKETT>他真以为我们不会发现吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Did he really think that we weren't gonna find out about it?

181
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,840
<6-9,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我的天
<6-9,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Oh, my goodness.

182
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,380
<6-9,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>是佩内洛普干的  对吧
<6-9,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>It was Penelope, wasn't it?

183
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,500
<6-10,GATES>汉娜那样破坏她的婚姻
<6-10,GATES>Well, after what Hannah did to her marriage,

184
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,600
<6-10,GATES>真不忍责怪她
<6-10,GATES>I wouldn't blame her.

185
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,440
<6-10,GATES>是这样  鲍勃失业后
<6-10,GATES>See, Penelope kept her family afloat

186
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,940
<6-10,GATES>是佩内洛普赚钱养家
<6-10,GATES>after Bob lost his job,

187
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,890
<6-10,GATES>然后她给了汉娜一个大好机会
<6-10,GATES>and then she gives Hannah this--this big break,

188
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,120
<6-10,GATES>而汉娜回报她的方式
<6-10,GATES>and then Hannah repays her

189
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
<6-10,GATES>就是跟她无能的丈夫搞到一起
<6-10,GATES>by screwing her worthless excuse of a husband.

190
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,890
<6-11,CASTLE>你是《华尔街之妻》的粉丝吗
<6-11,CASTLE>You're a fan of "Wives of wall street"?

191
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,650
<6-12,GATES>当然了  这是最棒的真人秀  怎么了
<6-12,GATES>Oh, yeah. It's the best show on TV. Why?

192
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,210
<6-13,CASTLE>没什么  我只是以为像你这样的女人
<6-13,CASTLE>I don't--I just assumed that a woman like you

193
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,940
<6-13,CASTLE>会喜欢更加...深奥的精神食粮
<6-13,CASTLE>would prefer more... sophisticated fare.

194
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,580
<6-14,GATES>你说什么
<6-14,GATES>Excuse me?

195
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,110
<6-14,GATES>你刚说什么
<6-14,GATES>W-what did you just say?

196
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,040
<6-15,BECKETT>蕾妮  什么事
<6-15,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie. What's up?

197
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,450
<6-16,LANIE>我给你发了一张指甲碎片的图片
<6-16,LANIE>I'm sending you a picture of a fingernail fragment

198
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,300
<6-16,LANIE>是从被害人的头皮中拔出的
<6-16,LANIE>I pulled from the victim's scalp.

199
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,050
<6-16,LANIE>我猜是凶手在袭击时留下的
<6-16,LANIE>I figured it came from the killer during the attack.

200
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,160
<6-17,BECKETT>你能查下DNA吗
<6-17,BECKETT>Can you run D.N.A.?

201
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,510
<6-18,LANIE>已经在做了
<6-18,LANIE>It's already happening.

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,560
<6-19,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<6-19,BECKETT>Great. Thank you.

203

<6-20,CASTLE>'sito, is it just me or...

204
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,510
<6-21,ESPOSITO>这两个颜色是不是完全一致
<6-21,ESPOSITO>Is that a perfect match?

205
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,170
<7-1,PETER>等一等
<7-1,PETER>Okay, wait a minute.

206
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,940
<7-1,PETER>你们过度解读了
<7-1,PETER>You're reading too much into this.

207
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,980
<7-1,PETER>至少等到我们拍摄完毕好吗
<7-1,PETER>Can you at least wait until we're done filming?

208
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,790
<4-1,HANNAH GREEN>-我并没有  -还真是优雅的说法
<4-1,HANNAH GREEN>- I am not having-- - What a classy thing to say.

209
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,710
<4-1,HANNAH GREEN>天啊  你不知道我多认真
<4-1,HANNAH GREEN>Oh, my-- you don't know how I meant it.

210
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,510
<7-1,PETER>-她又不是故意的  -我没那意思
<7-1,PETER>- Like she did it on purpose? - I'm not saying that.

211
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,270
<7-2,COLETTE>我们不会取消婚礼
<7-2,COLETTE>Well, we're not canceling the wedding.

212
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,490
<7-3,ASHLEY>我只是说这一切糟透了  好吗
<7-3,ASHLEY>Look, I'm just saying that this sucks, okay?

213
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,850
<7-3,ASHLEY>汉娜居然在我们婚礼前一个月去世了
<7-3,ASHLEY>Hannah dying a month before our wedding...

214
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,270
<7-3,ASHLEY>-亲爱的  -阿什莉说得对
<7-3,ASHLEY>- Hush, darling. - Ashley's right.

215
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,810
<7-4,STONE>或许我们应该延期之类的
<7-4,STONE>Maybe we should, like, postpone it or something.

216
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,230
<7-5,PENELOPE>延期
<7-5,PENELOPE>Postpone?

217
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,100
<7-5,PENELOPE>就为了那个贱人
<7-5,PENELOPE>For that bitch?

218
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,410
<7-6,MARGO>佩内洛普
<7-6,MARGO>Penelope!

219
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,910

<7-7,PENELOPE>Look, it's not like I killed her.

220

<7-8,BECKETT>Detective Beckett, NYPD.

222
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,120
<7-9,PENELOPE>你好吗
<7-9,PENELOPE>How do you do?

223
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,590
<7-10,BECKETT>我很好
<7-10,BECKETT>I'm fine.

224
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,710
<7-10,BECKETT>但是你
<7-10,BECKETT>Uh, but you...

225
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,150
<7-10,BECKETT>要被逮捕了
<7-10,BECKETT>are under arrest

226
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,740
<7-10,BECKETT>罪名是谋杀汉娜·格林
<7-10,BECKETT>for the murder of Hannah Green.

227
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,770
<7-11,CASTLE>所以我猜的确是你杀了她
<7-11,CASTLE>So I guess it is like you killed her.

228
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,900
<7-12,PETER>还在拍摄吗  刚那段拍下来没
<7-12,PETER>Are you still rolling? Did you get that?

242
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,250
<8-1,PENELOPE>你们竟敢在演职人员面前逮捕我
<8-1,PENELOPE>How dare you arrest me in front of the cast and crew.

243
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,910
<8-2,BECKETT>你该担心的是这个  佩内洛普
<8-2,BECKETT>You should be more worried about this, Penelope.

244
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,920
<8-2,BECKETT>这是一份实验室报告
<8-2,BECKETT>That's a lab report

245
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,630
<8-2,BECKETT>关于在汉娜头发里发现的指甲碎片
<8-2,BECKETT>for a fingernail fragment found in Hannah's hair.

246
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,550
<8-2,BECKETT>DNA检测结果与你吻合
<8-2,BECKETT>It's a D.N.A. Match to you.

247
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
<8-2,BECKETT>你想说说它是怎么到那里去的吗
<8-2,BECKETT>You want to tell me how it got there?

248
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,020
<8-2,BECKETT>因为要是你不说
<8-2,BECKETT>Because if you won't,

249
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,910
<8-2,BECKETT>我肯定你丈夫鲍勃会说的
<8-2,BECKETT>I'm sure your husband Bob will.

250
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,210
<8-2,BECKETT>鲍勃  得了吧
<8-2,BECKETT>Bob? Come on.

251
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,870
<8-3,PENELOPE>你以为他会跟你说什么
<8-3,PENELOPE>What do you think he's gonna tell you?

252
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,450
<8-3,PENELOPE>那个混蛋是个蠢货
<8-3,PENELOPE>That poor bastard is so stupid

253
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,550
<8-3,PENELOPE>他还以为汉娜对他有真感情
<8-3,PENELOPE>He thought Hannah actually had feelings for him.

254
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,710
<8-3,PENELOPE>而大家都知道她想要的
<8-3,PENELOPE>And everybody knew all she wanted to do

255
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,610
<8-3,PENELOPE>是提高在节目中的关注度
<8-3,PENELOPE>was up her profile on the show.

256
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,940
<8-3,PENELOPE>她只是在利用他
<8-3,PENELOPE>She was just using him.

257
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,380
<9-1,BOB>那是真爱
<9-1,BOB>It was true love.

258
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,310
<9-1,BOB>汉娜和我相爱了
<9-1,BOB>Hannah and I were in love.

259
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,530
<9-2,ESPOSITO>我们知道你的妻子佩内洛普和汉娜打了一架
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Well, we know your wife Penelope and Hannah had a fight.

260
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,780
<9-2,ESPOSITO>最近他们之间的战争升级了吗
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Had things been escalating between them lately?

261
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,680
<9-3,BOB>汉娜和我从不谈论佩内洛普
<9-3,BOB>Hannah and I never talked about Penelope.

262
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,920
<9-4,RYAN>但是你跟汉娜同居
<9-4,RYAN>But you lived with Hannah.

263
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,180
<9-4,RYAN>你知道她昨晚去了哪里吗
<9-4,RYAN>Do you know where she was last night?

264
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,980
<9-4,RYAN>不
<9-4,RYAN>No.

265
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,280
<9-5,BOB>她昨晚没回家
<9-5,BOB>She didn't come home last night

266
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,930
<9-5,BOB>我昨天一整天都没见到她
<9-5,BOB>and I didn't see her all day yesterday.

267
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,050
<9-6,RYAN>那很反常吗
<9-6,RYAN>Was that unusual?

268
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,480
<9-7,BOB>对  我很担心
<9-7,BOB>Yeah, I was worried.

269
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,810
<9-7,BOB>但是你真觉得佩内洛普会杀了她吗
<9-7,BOB>But do you really think penelope could killed her?

270
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,260
<10-1,PENELOPE>我当然想杀她
<10-1,PENELOPE>Hell, yeah, I wanted to kill her.

271
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,700
<10-1,PENELOPE>但是当着全美人民的面吗
<10-1,PENELOPE>But with all of America watching?

272
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,840
<10-1,PENELOPE>你以为我有多蠢
<10-1,PENELOPE>How stupid do you think I am?

273
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,020
<10-2,BECKETT>那指甲是怎么回事
<10-2,BECKETT>What about the fingernail?

274
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,820
<10-3,PENELOPE>事实是
<10-3,PENELOPE>The truth is...

275
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,540
<10-3,PENELOPE>汉娜跟我确实有些争执
<10-3,PENELOPE>Hannah and I did have a little dustup.

276
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,470
<10-3,PENELOPE>但不是在她被害当晚
<10-3,PENELOPE>But not the night that she was killed.

277
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,000
<10-3,PENELOPE>是前一晚
<10-3,PENELOPE>It was the night before.

278
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,500
<10-4,BECKETT>那次争执的内容是什么
<10-4,BECKETT>Okay, so what was the nature of this dustup?

279
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,550
<10-5,PENELOPE>我们在拍摄忏悔场面
<10-5,PENELOPE>We were filming confessionals.

280
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,750
<10-5,PENELOPE>汉娜在摄影棚外等我
<10-5,PENELOPE>Hannah waited for me outside the studio,

281
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,930
<10-5,PENELOPE>说她想谈一谈
<10-5,PENELOPE>said she wanted to talk.

282
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,780
<10-6,BECKETT>-关于什么  -玛格
<10-6,BECKETT>- About what? - Margo.

283
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,530
<10-7,PENELOPE>我炒掉汉娜之后玛格雇佣了她
<10-7,PENELOPE>Margo hired Hannah after I fired her ass.

284
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,150
<10-7,PENELOPE>不出意料
<10-7,PENELOPE>And no surprise,

285
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,260
<10-7,PENELOPE>汉娜和玛格在工作上出现了问题
<10-7,PENELOPE>Hannah and Margo were having trouble at work.

286
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,670
<10-7,PENELOPE>尽管听起来很疯狂
<10-7,PENELOPE>And crazy as it sounds,

287
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,060
<10-7,PENELOPE>那个贱人希望我重新雇佣她
<10-7,PENELOPE>that bitch wanted me to rehire her.

288
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,260
<10-8,BECKETT>你真以为我会相信
<10-8,BECKETT>Do you actually expect me to believe

289
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,190
<10-8,BECKETT>她毁了你的婚姻
<10-8,BECKETT>that she asked you for her job back

290
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,810
<10-8,BECKETT>却又来求你再雇她吗
<10-8,BECKETT>after she ruined your marriage?

291
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,190
<10-9,PENELOPE>你以为我为什么会失控
<10-9,PENELOPE>Why do you think I lost it?

292
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,930
<10-9,PENELOPE>我扯了她的头发  弄坏了指甲
<10-9,PENELOPE>I yanked her hair and broke my nail.

293
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,220
<10-9,PENELOPE>但仅此而已
<10-9,PENELOPE>But that was it.

294
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,060
<10-9,PENELOPE>她挣脱走人了
<10-9,PENELOPE>She broke free, took off,

295
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,640
<10-9,PENELOPE>那是我最后一次见到汉娜
<10-9,PENELOPE>and that was the last I saw of Hannah.

296
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,480
<10-10,BECKETT>你不介意我问下昨晚
<10-10,BECKETT>And I suppose you won't mind me asking

297
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,760
<10-10,BECKETT>10点15至11点15你在哪里吧
<10-10,BECKETT>where you were between 10:15 and 11:15 last night?

298
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,210
<11-1,BECKETT>诺合体育馆的跆拳道老师
<11-1,BECKETT>Okay, so the kickboxing teacher at Noho gym

299
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,760
<11-1,BECKETT>证实佩内洛普十点到十一点
<11-1,BECKETT>confirms that Penelope was "sweating her ass off"

300
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,550
<11-1,BECKETT>在市区一个教学班"挥汗如雨"
<11-1,BECKETT>downtown in a class from 10:00 till 11:00.

301
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,050
<11-1,BECKETT>所以杀害汉娜的凶手
<11-1,BECKETT>So whoever killed Hannah,

302
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,700
<11-1,BECKETT>并非佩内洛普·福斯特
<11-1,BECKETT>it wasn't Penelope Foster.

303
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
<11-2,CASTLE>那好吧  凶器查得怎么样
<11-2,CASTLE>Okay, then. Where are we on the murder weapon?

304
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,940
<11-3,BECKETT>没有指纹
<11-3,BECKETT>You know what? There's no fingerprints.

305
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,970
<11-3,BECKETT>不过他们在刀柄上
<11-3,BECKETT>But they did find antimony oxide

306
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,360
<11-3,BECKETT>找到了氧化锑
<11-3,BECKETT>on the knife's handle.

307
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,080
<11-4,CASTLE>没记错的话  这是阻燃剂
<11-4,CASTLE>A fire retardant if memory serves.

308
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,340
<11-5,BECKETT>从伤口情况看来
<11-5,BECKETT>And also, based on the wound,

309
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,190
<11-5,BECKETT>这把刀应该是新的  或者从没使用过
<11-5,BECKETT>it looks like the knife was new or had never been used.

310
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,810
<11-6,ESPOSITO>伙计们  来看这个
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Hey, guys. Check this out.

311
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,990
<11-6,ESPOSITO>一个粉丝拍了这张照片
<11-6,ESPOSITO>A fan took this and posted it

312
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
<11-6,ESPOSITO>然后传到《华尔街之妻》粉丝网上
<11-6,ESPOSITO>to a "Wives of Wall Street" fan site

313
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,190
<11-6,ESPOSITO>是案发当晚
<11-6,ESPOSITO>The night of the murder.

314
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,960
<11-7,BECKETT>这是汉娜
<11-7,BECKETT>That's Hannah.

315
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,720
<11-8,ESPOSITO>照片有时间戳
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and it was time stamped.

316
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,140
<11-8,ESPOSITO>这是她被害前二十分钟拍的
<11-8,ESPOSITO>This is 20 minutes before she was killed.

317
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
<11-8,ESPOSITO>二十分钟
<11-8,ESPOSITO>20 minutes?

318
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,870
<11-9,CASTLE>这栋楼一定和她的凶杀案有关系
<11-9,CASTLE>So that building must have something to do with the murder.

319
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,980
<11-9,CASTLE>知道在哪吗
<11-9,CASTLE>Uh, any idea where it is?

320
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,910
<11-10,ESPOSITO>照片没有位置信息
<11-10,ESPOSITO>The photo wasn't geotagged,

321
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,540
<11-10,ESPOSITO>但能看到这栋楼的门牌号以46结尾
<11-10,ESPOSITO>but you can see part of the building's number ends in 46.

322
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,430
<11-11,GATES>我知道谁住这里
<11-11,GATES>And I can tell you who lives here.

323
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,090
<11-11,GATES>我认识这栋楼
<11-11,GATES>I know this building.

324
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,700
<11-11,GATES>是真人秀里的
<11-11,GATES>It's from the show.

325
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,510
<11-11,GATES>这是玛格家  在上西区某处
<11-11,GATES>This is Margo's place, somewhere on the upper west.

326
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,620
<11-11,GATES>83街以南
<11-11,GATES>South of 83rd.

327
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,150
<11-12,BECKETT>等等  也就是说玛格就住在汉娜
<11-12,BECKETT>Wait. That means Margo lives right around the corner

328
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,040
<11-12,BECKETT>死亡现场不远处
<11-12,BECKETT>from where Hannah was killed.

329
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,600
<12-1,STONE>我妈妈在打电话
<12-1,STONE>My mom's just wrapping up a call,

330
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,130
<12-1,STONE>她马上就出来  等她
<12-1,STONE>but she'll be right out, as soon as s--

331
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,070
<12-2,MARGO>我回头再跟你说  我来了
<12-2,MARGO>I will talk to you later. Here I am.

332
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,390
<12-2,MARGO>谢谢  亲爱的
<12-2,MARGO>Thank you, sweetheart.

333
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,660
<12-2,MARGO>有什么事吗
<12-2,MARGO>How can I help you?

334
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,820
<12-3,BECKETT>我们就是想理清
<12-3,BECKETT>Uh, we just needed to go over

335
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,030
<12-3,BECKETT>汉娜死前24小时都做了些什么
<12-3,BECKETT>the last 24 hours of Hannah's life.

336
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,470
<12-3,BECKETT>我们想知道
<12-3,BECKETT>And we were wondering,

337
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,900
<12-3,BECKETT>你最后一次见她是什么时候
<12-3,BECKETT>when was it that you last saw her?

338
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,760
<12-4,MARGO>她昨晚十点过来待了几分钟  怎么了
<12-4,MARGO>She came by around 10:00 last night for a few minutes. Why?

339
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,370
<12-5,CASTLE>她走后  就在离这里不远处被杀了
<12-5,CASTLE>Because she was killed around the corner from here just after leaving.

340
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,890
<12-6,MARGO>太可怕了
<12-6,MARGO>That's terrible.

341
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,310
<12-7,BECKETT>的确
<12-7,BECKETT>Yes, yes, it is.

342
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
<12-7,BECKETT>介意告诉我们她来干什么吗
<12-7,BECKETT>Um, would you mind telling us why she came by?

343
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,470
<12-8,MARGO>道歉
<12-8,MARGO>To apologize.

344
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,370
<12-9,BECKETT>为什么道歉
<12-9,BECKETT>For what?

345
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,820
<12-10,MARGO>佩内洛普因为外遇的事炒了汉娜之后
<12-10,MARGO>After Penelope fired Hannah for the affair,

346
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,240
<12-10,MARGO>我聘请她和我儿子斯通一起
<12-10,MARGO>I hired her to develop a clothing line

347
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,630
<12-10,MARGO>发展一个服装系列
<12-10,MARGO>with my son Stone.

348
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,190
<12-10,MARGO>我听说她很有天赋
<12-10,MARGO>I heard she had talent and...

349
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,010
<12-13,CASTLE>能多争取些上镜机会也不错
<12-13,CASTLE>It wouldn't hurt to get some screen time.

350
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,430
<12-10,MARGO>鲍勃和汉娜的外遇事件
<12-10,MARGO>Bob and Hannah's affair has been

351
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,320
<12-10,MARGO>过去几个月一直被大肆报道
<12-10,MARGO>the big story arc these past few months.

352
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,750
<12-10,MARGO>三天前  她本该过来
<12-10,MARGO>Three days ago, she was supposed to come by

353
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,400
<12-10,MARGO>介绍她的理念
<12-10,MARGO>and present her ideas.

354
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,740
<12-10,MARGO>《华尔街之妻》的团队
<12-10,MARGO>The "Wives of Wall Street" cameras

355
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,590
<12-10,MARGO>都过来准备拍摄了
<12-10,MARGO>were here and ready to roll,

356
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,220
<12-10,MARGO>汉娜却没有出现
<12-10,MARGO>and Hannah's a no-show.

357
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,280
<12-11,CASTLE>她解释原因了吗
<12-11,CASTLE>Did she say why?

358
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,890
<12-11,CASTLE>没有
<12-11,CASTLE>No.

359
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,280
<12-12,MARGO>要是别人的话  我早开除了
<12-12,MARGO>If it was anyone else, I would fire her.

360
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,650
<12-13,CASTLE>但能多争取些上镜机会也不错
<12-13,CASTLE>But it didn't hurt that you got a little more screen time.

361
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,360
<12-13,CASTLE>我知道这很俗
<12-13,CASTLE>I know that's crass,

362
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,980
<12-14,MARGO>可这行就是这样的
<12-14,MARGO>but that's how this works.

363
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,350
<12-14,MARGO>汉娜那晚过来
<12-14,MARGO>When she came that night,

364
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,900
<12-14,MARGO>只说自己很抱歉
<12-14,MARGO>Hannah only said she was sorry

365
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,230
<12-14,MARGO>并且答应会好好工作
<12-14,MARGO>and promised to recommit to her job.

366
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,420
<12-15,BECKETT>她说接着要去哪了吗
<12-15,BECKETT>Did she tell you where she was going afterwards?

367
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,430
<12-16,MARGO>没有  我以为
<12-16,MARGO>No. I-I assumed that...

368
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,310
<12-16,MARGO>她会回家的
<12-16,MARGO>she was going home.

369
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,420
<12-17,BECKETT>她走后你做什么了
<12-17,BECKETT>And what did you do when she left?

370
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,640
<12-18,MARGO>我跟我的娱乐律师电话会议
<12-18,MARGO>I jumped on a conference call with my entertainment attorney

371
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,350
<12-18,MARGO>讨论斯通和阿什莉的资产分配
<12-18,MARGO>to discuss Stone and Ashley's spin-off.

372
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,340
<13-1,BECKETT>电话记录证实玛格确实
<13-1,BECKETT>So phone records confirm that Margo made

373
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,130
<13-1,BECKETT>在10点23分用她的固定电话给她的娱乐律师
<13-1,BECKETT>a 56-minute phone call to her entertainment lawyer

374
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,020
<13-1,BECKETT>打了一通长达56分钟的电话
<13-1,BECKETT>at 10:23 from her landline at the apartment.

375
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,650
<13-2,CASTLE>其实任何订阅
<13-2,CASTLE>You know, the truth is anyone who subscribes

376
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,150
<13-2,CASTLE>《华尔街之妻》网站的人
<13-2,CASTLE>to the "Wives of Wall Street" web site

377
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,200
<13-2,CASTLE>都能从照片看出汉娜在玛格家
<13-2,CASTLE>would've know that Hannah was at Margo's building from that photo.

378
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,510
<13-2,CASTLE>有新东西发布  网站会发短信提醒你
<13-2,CASTLE>They send out text alerts any time there's a new post.

379
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,640
<13-2,CASTLE>有几十万人订阅了这网站
<13-2,CASTLE>And they have hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

380
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,450
<13-3,ESPOSITO>我这儿有个神秘事件
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Hey. I got a little mystery here.

381
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,040
<13-4,CASTLE>你是说除了你的情人节计划吗
<13-4,CASTLE>You mean besides your Valentine's Day plans?

382
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,080
<13-5,ESPOSITO>汉娜的财政状况
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Hannah's financials.

383
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,500
<13-6,ESPOSITO>过去两个月
<13-6,ESPOSITO>For the past two months,

384
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,990
<13-6,ESPOSITO>她每周都会存五千美元现金
<13-6,ESPOSITO>she's been making weekly cash deposits of 5 grand.

385
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,730
<13-6,ESPOSITO>我问过她的家人  还有真人秀里的人
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Now I checked with her family, everyone on the show.

386
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,810
<13-6,ESPOSITO>都不知道钱是哪来的
<13-6,ESPOSITO>No one knows where it's coming from.

387
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,050
<13-7,BECKETT>应该不是卖女童子军饼干赚来的吧
<13-7,BECKETT>I take it she didn't make it selling girl scout cookies.

388
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,960
<13-8,ESPOSITO>也许跟她没去向玛格介绍
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe it has something to do with where she was

389
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,120
<13-8,ESPOSITO>服装系列的理念那天去的地方有关
<13-8,ESPOSITO>when she missed the pitch meeting with Margo on her fashion line.

390
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,100
<13-8,ESPOSITO>信用卡记录显示当时她在布鲁克林
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Credit card charge puts her at a dive bar

391
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,810
<13-8,ESPOSITO>一家叫最后一站的酒吧
<13-8,ESPOSITO>in Brooklyn called the Last Stop.

392
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,160
<13-9,BECKETT>酒吧  她为什么去那里
<13-9,BECKETT>A dive bar? What was she doing there

393
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,430
<13-9,BECKETT>而不是出席她人生中最重要的一次会议
<13-9,BECKETT>instead of at the most important meeting of her life?

394
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,940
<13-10,ESPOSITO>不清楚  酒保说她和某个男人
<13-10,ESPOSITO>I don't know. The bartender said she was having

395
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,390
<13-10,ESPOSITO>聊得热火朝天
<13-10,ESPOSITO>a pretty heated discussion with some dude,

396
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,550
<13-10,ESPOSITO>于是我请酒保来帮素描师给那个人画像
<13-10,ESPOSITO>so I got the bartender sitting down with a sketch artist.

397
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,730
<13-10,ESPOSITO>看我们能否查出是谁
<13-10,ESPOSITO>See if we can figure out who he is.

398
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,680
<13-11,RYAN>抱歉
<13-11,RYAN>Uh, sorry.

399
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,310
<13-11,RYAN>我得回家...
<13-11,RYAN>I had to run home and, uh...

400
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,900
<13-12,CASTLE>造人
<13-12,CASTLE>Cock-a-doodle-doo?

401
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,530
<13-13,ESPOSITO>说得好
<13-13,ESPOSITO>That's good.

402
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,590
<13-13,ESPOSITO>没错
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Uh, yeah.

403
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,240
<13-14,RYAN>明天将会是有史以来最不浪漫的情人节
<13-14,RYAN>Tomorrow's going to be the least romantic Valentine's Day ever.

404
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,860
<13-15,RYAN>谢了
<13-15,RYAN>Oh, thank you.

405
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,010
<13-16,BECKETT>我让技术人员查了汉娜死前的24小时
<13-16,BECKETT>So I had tech look into Hannah's last 24 hours,

406
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,620
<13-17,RYAN>就是和佩内洛普吵架之后
<13-17,RYAN>after her fight with Penelope

407
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,350
<13-17,RYAN>去玛格家之前的活动
<13-17,RYAN>and before showing up at Margo's.

408
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,590
<13-18,BECKETT>有什么有用的线索吗
<13-18,BECKETT>And did they find anything useful?

409
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,920
<13-18,BECKETT>完全没有
<13-18,BECKETT>They didn't find anything at all.

410
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,860
<13-19,RYAN>她没打电话
<13-19,RYAN>She didn't make any calls,

411
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,290
<13-19,RYAN>没接电话  没发短信
<13-19,RYAN>didn't answer any calls, sent no texts.

412
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,340
<13-19,RYAN>甚至没有登录电邮
<13-19,RYAN>She didn't even log on to her e-mail

413
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,600
<13-19,RYAN>或其他在线账号
<13-19,RYAN>or any other online accounts.

414
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,380
<13-19,RYAN>完全没有使用电子设备的痕迹
<13-19,RYAN>No digital fingerprint whatsoever.

415
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,880
<13-20,ESPOSITO>就好像凭空消失了一样
<13-20,ESPOSITO>Well, it's like she disappeared.

416
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,160
<13-21,CASTLE>她怎么会24小时不用电子设备呢
<13-21,CASTLE>Why would she go radio silent for 24 hours?

417
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,680
<13-22,BECKETT>她到底上哪去了
<13-22,BECKETT>And where the hell was she?

418
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,430
<14-1,LANIE>我来告诉你们她上哪去了
<14-1,LANIE>I'll tell you where she was--

419
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,830
<14-1,LANIE>马达加斯加
<14-1,LANIE>Madagascar.

420
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,600
<14-2,CASTLE>就是位于非洲
<14-2,CASTLE>As in the country

421
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,190
<14-2,CASTLE>东南海岸的那个国家
<14-2,CASTLE>off the southeastern coast of Africa,

422
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,320
<14-2,CASTLE>因有爱动画电影而出名的那个
<14-2,CASTLE>made famous by the adorable animated film?

423
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,460
<14-3,LANIE>没错  我在她指甲里找到的物质
<14-3,LANIE>Yep. The material I found underneath her fingernails--

424
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,170
<14-3,LANIE>不是凶手的皮肤组织
<14-3,LANIE>not skin from an attacker.

425
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,500
<14-4,BECKETT>而是亚龙木
<14-4,BECKETT>It's alluaudia.

426
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,750
<14-4,BECKETT>亚龙木是什么
<14-4,BECKETT>And what is alluaudia?

427
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,840
<14-5,LANIE>一种珍稀多刺的植物
<14-5,LANIE>A rare spiny plant

428
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,770
<14-5,LANIE>主要生长于马达加斯加
<14-5,LANIE>cultivated primarily in Madagascar.

429
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,750
<14-6,CASTLE>那又是怎么跑到她指甲里去的
<14-6,CASTLE>So how did it get under her fingernails?

430
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,670
<14-7,LANIE>问倒我了
<14-7,LANIE>Beats me.

431
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,050
<14-7,LANIE>至于她的自卫伤
<14-7,LANIE>As for her defensive wounds,

432
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,910
<14-7,LANIE>不是临死前留下的
<14-7,LANIE>they were not sustained at the time of murder.

433
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,870
<14-7,LANIE>而是24小时之前
<14-7,LANIE>They're from 24 hours prior.

434
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,350
<14-8,BECKETT>那差不多是她消失的那段时间
<14-8,BECKETT>That's about the time that she went off the grid,

435
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,270
<14-8,BECKETT>两者之间一定有联系
<14-8,BECKETT>which means there's gotta be a connection.

436
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,720
<14-9,LANIE>必须有
<14-9,LANIE>Oh, I think there is.

437
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,070
<14-9,LANIE>记得这个擦伤吗
<14-9,LANIE>Remember this abrasion?

438
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,270
<14-10,BECKETT>记得
<14-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

439
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,960
<14-11,LANIE>我知道这是怎么搞的了
<14-11,LANIE>Well, I figured out what caused it.

440
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,870
<14-11,LANIE>她的钻石手链
<14-11,LANIE>Her diamond tennis bracelet.

441
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
<14-12,CASTLE>但是那个不是戴在
<14-12,CASTLE>But wasn't that...

442
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,660
<14-12,CASTLE>右手吗
<14-12,CASTLE>on her right wrist?

443
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,420
<14-13,LANIE>好记性
<14-13,LANIE>Good memory.

444
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,070
<14-14,CASTLE>所以说她的手是被绑在一起了
<14-14,CASTLE>So her wrists were tied together.

445
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,560
<14-15,LANIE>紧紧地绑了好几个小时
<14-15,LANIE>Tight and for several hours.

446
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,780
<14-16,BECKETT>这就说得通了
<14-16,BECKETT>Now it's making sense--

447
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,700
<14-16,BECKETT>第二天还穿着一样的衣服
<14-16,BECKETT>wearing the same clothes overnight...

448
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,720
<14-17,CASTLE>消失的一整天
<14-17,CASTLE>The radio silence...

449
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,450
<14-18,BECKETT>自卫伤口是在死亡前24小时造成的
<14-18,BECKETT>And the defensive wounds 24 hours prior to death.

450
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,000
<14-19,CASTLE>汉娜是被绑架了
<14-19,CASTLE>Hannah was held hostage.

451
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,550
<15-1,BECKETT>如果她被绑架了
<15-1,BECKETT>If Hannah was being held hostage,

452
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,950
<15-1,BECKETT>她怎么没报案呢
<15-1,BECKETT>then why didn't she report it?

453
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,900
<15-2,RYAN>她又是怎么神奇地跑到马达加斯加去了
<15-2,RYAN>And how did she get magically transported to Madagascar?

454
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,870
<15-3,CASTLE>她为什么要去玛格那为旷工而道歉
<15-3,CASTLE>And why would she go afterwards to Margo's to apologize for missing work?

455
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,300
<15-4,BECKETT>一定和那些五千块的存款
<15-4,BECKETT>It has to have something to do with those $5,000 payments

456
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,640
<15-4,BECKETT>和在布鲁克林酒吧与神秘男人会面有关
<15-4,BECKETT>and that meeting with that mystery man at the bar in Brooklyn.

457
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,470
<15-5,CASTLE>看起来毫无关联
<15-5,CASTLE>It all seems so random.

458
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,310
<15-5,CASTLE>我知道在最后
<15-5,CASTLE>I mean, I know by the end of this,

459
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,770
<15-5,CASTLE>这些线索都会完美地凶残地联系在一起
<15-5,CASTLE>all of these clues will fit together beautifully in a murderous mosaic.

460
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,160
<15-7,CASTLE>但是怎么联系上的呢
<15-7,CASTLE>But... how?

461
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,460
<15-7,CASTLE>等等
<15-7,CASTLE>Wait.

462
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,280
<15-7,CASTLE>这是你送我的情人节礼物吗
<15-7,CASTLE>Is this your Valentine's Day gift to me,

463
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,980
<15-7,CASTLE>一桩毫无头绪的复杂而神秘的案子
<15-7,CASTLE>a complex mystery where nothing makes sense?

464
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,310
<15-7,CASTLE>你真是太了解我了
<15-7,CASTLE>You know me so well.

465
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,710
<15-8,ESPOSITO>我真不想打扰你们的爱的交流
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Um, I hate to interrupt your little, uh, love connection.

466
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,280
<15-8,ESPOSITO>不过我查了交通摄像头
<15-8,ESPOSITO>but I checked traffic cameras.

467
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,170
<15-8,ESPOSITO>找到汉娜打车到玛格家的录像
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I found footage of Hannah arriving at Margo's building in a taxi.

468
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,000
<15-8,ESPOSITO>记下出租车牌照
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I got the medallion.

469
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,980
<15-8,ESPOSITO>联系了司机  他的记录显示
<15-8,ESPOSITO>I talked to the cabbie, whose log showed

470
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,840
<15-8,ESPOSITO>汉娜是在78大道和莱克星敦街交界处上车的
<15-8,ESPOSITO>that the he picked up Hannah at 78th and Lex.

471
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,420
<15-9,BECKETT>他说了她是从哪出来的吗
<15-9,BECKETT>Did he say where she was coming from--

472
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,130
<15-9,BECKETT>是家里  还是店里
<15-9,BECKETT>Building, store?

473
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,830
<15-10,ESPOSITO>他不知道
<15-10,ESPOSITO>He didn't know.

474
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,940
<15-10,ESPOSITO>他说她招手让他停车时就站在街角
<15-10,ESPOSITO>He said that she was standing on the corner when she flagged him down.

475
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,460
<15-11,RYAN>她可能是从任何地方出来
<15-11,RYAN>Well, then she could've come from anywhere.

476
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,150
<15-11,RYAN>我们没办法缩小这个范围
<15-11,RYAN>There's no way we can narrow that down, bro.

477
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,320
<15-12,GATES>也许有办法哦
<15-12,GATES>Maybe there is.

478
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,180
<15-12,GATES>我找到一个农业部的负责人
<15-12,GATES>I spoke to a regulator at the department of agriculture.

479
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,520
<15-12,GATES>亚龙木多用于绿色可持续型建筑
<15-12,GATES>It seems Alluaudia is used in green sustainable architecture

480
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,020
<15-12,GATES>毯子  地板和壁纸什么的
<15-12,GATES>in rugs, flooring, wallpaper,

481
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,750
<15-12,GATES>可能就是那附近的哪栋建筑
<15-12,GATES>possibly from a building nearby.

482
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,650
<15-13,BECKETT>埃斯波  你带警员去排查
<15-13,BECKETT>Espo, you get uniforms to canvass the area

483
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,400
<15-13,BECKETT>78大道和莱克星敦街附近
<15-13,BECKETT>around 78th and Lex

484
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,300
<15-13,BECKETT>看看有没有绿色可持续型建筑
<15-13,BECKETT>and see if there's any green sustainable buildings

485
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,080
<15-13,BECKETT>用到亚什么的树
<15-13,BECKETT>that might use that allu-- whatever the plant is.

486
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,860
<15-14,ESPOSITO>好的
<15-14,ESPOSITO>As you wish.

487
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,920
<15-15,CASTLE>盖茨警监
<15-15,CASTLE>Captain Gates,

488
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,770
<15-15,CASTLE>参与案子  忙于不着边际的推测
<15-15,CASTLE>participating in the case, engaging in idle speculation--

489
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,960
<15-15,CASTLE>我们挺像的嘛  你和我
<15-15,CASTLE>we are not so different, you and I.

490
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,330
<15-16,CASTLE>有一些不同
<15-16,CASTLE>There's... there's a difference.

491
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,080
<15-16,CASTLE>我们不一样
<15-16,CASTLE>We're different.

492
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,890
<15-17,GATES>知道吗  这可能会是重要突破点
<15-17,GATES>You know, this could actually be our big break,

493
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,540
<15-17,GATES>如果我没在那张照片上
<15-17,GATES>only we may not have gotten to it

494
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,450
<15-17,GATES>认出玛格的住处  也许就发现不了
<15-17,GATES>if I hadn't recognized Margo's building in that photo,

495
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,860
<15-17,GATES>所以我觉得你们每个人
<15-17,GATES>which is why I think each of you

496
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,900
<15-17,GATES>今晚都应该看看《华尔街之妻》
<15-17,GATES>should watch some "Wives of Wall Street" episodes tonight--

497
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,740
<15-17,GATES>为了案子
<15-17,GATES>for the good of the case.

498
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,330
<15-18,CASTLE>想去我家一起看吗
<15-18,CASTLE>So... would you like to come over for a little viewing party?

499
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,340
<15-19,BECKETT>好给你机会缠着我问情人节礼物吗
<15-19,BECKETT>So you can badger me about what I'm getting you for Valentine's Day?

500
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,790
<15-19,BECKETT>不了  我还是不去了
<15-19,BECKETT>No, thanks. I think I will pass.

501
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,210
<15-20,CASTLE>不过我要警告你
<15-20,CASTLE>Okay, but I'm warning you,

502
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,970
<15-20,CASTLE>我对送礼挺好胜的
<15-20,CASTLE>I'm kind of competitive when it comes to giving gifts.

503
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,970
<15-20,CASTLE>如果你的礼物没我的好  别伤心
<15-20,CASTLE>Don't feel bad if yours isn't as good as mine.

504
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,980
<15-21,BECKETT>如果比你的好呢
<15-21,BECKETT>What if it's better?

505
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,280
<15-22,CASTLE>比我的好
<15-22,CASTLE>Better?

506
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,770
<15-24,CASTLE>怎么可能会比我好
<15-24,CASTLE>How could it possibly be better?

507
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,980
<15-25,BECKETT>取决于你会送我什么
<15-25,BECKETT>Oh, I guess it just depends on what you got me.

508
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,320
<16-1,MARTHA>理查德  这简直太美了
<16-1,MARTHA>Oh, Richard. These are breathtaking.

509
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,340
<16-2,ALEXIS>贝克特肯定会喜欢的  老爸
<16-2,ALEXIS>Beckett is going to love them, Dad.

510
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,200
<16-2,ALEXIS>是吧
<16-2,ALEXIS>Right?

511
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,550
<16-3,CASTLE>想要和这个比  她可要费点心思啊
<16-3,CASTLE>She'll have a tough time competing with that.

512
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,880
<16-3,CASTLE>这就是和礼物忍者谈恋爱的苦恼啊
<16-3,CASTLE>One of the perils of dating a gift ninja.

513
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
<16-4,MARTHA>想成为真正的忍者吗
<16-4,MARTHA>Ooh, you want to be a real ninja?

514
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,780
<16-4,MARTHA>只要趁她不注意时放进她大衣口袋
<16-4,MARTHA>You just slip these into her coat pocket when she's not looking.

515
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,680
<16-6,CASTLE>妈妈  我喜欢这个主意  出其不意
<16-6,CASTLE>Mother, I like that idea. The element of surprise.

516
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,080
<16-6,CASTLE>忍者的手法
<16-6,CASTLE>The ninja way.

517
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
<16-7,CASTLE>你呢  阿丽克西斯  和麦克斯约好了吗
<16-7,CASTLE>What about you, Alexis? Any plans with Max?

518
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,690
<16-8,ALEXIS>我们准备一起学习就好了
<16-8,ALEXIS>Uh, we're just going to study together.

519
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,450
<16-9,CASTLE>听起来和平时没什么两样
<16-9,CASTLE>Doesn't sound very special.

520
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,820
<16-10,ALEXIS>我想大多数时间会研究对方的眼睛
<16-10,ALEXIS>Well, I think we'll mostly just study each other's eyes.

521
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,440
<16-11,CASTLE>你呢  妈妈  有什么安排吗
<16-11,CASTLE>And you, mother, any special plans?

522
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
<16-12,MARTHA>我们准备在我工作室演读《情书》
<16-12,MARTHA>We're gonna do dramatic readings of "Love letters" at my studio.

523
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,350
<16-13,CASTLE>很好啊
<16-13,CASTLE>Oh, well, that's nice.

524
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,500
<16-13,CASTLE>说起戏剧  有人想和我一起看
<16-13,CASTLE>And speaking of drama, would anyone like to join me

525
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,300
<16-13,CASTLE>《华尔街之妻》吗
<16-13,CASTLE>for a screening of "Wives of Wall Street,"

526
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,900
<16-13,CASTLE>还有爆米花
<16-13,CASTLE>Popcorn included?

527
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,950
<17-1,MARGO>怎么能吃两个小时的午饭  汉娜
<17-1,MARGO>2-hour lunches are not acceptable, Hannah.

528
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,240
<17-1,MARGO>我们这可是做生意
<17-1,MARGO>We're running a business here.

529
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,540
<17-2,HANNAH>我没去吃饭  是去拿面料样品了
<17-2,HANNAH>I wasn't at lunch. I was getting fabric samples.

530
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,680
<17-3,MARGO>那也不是迟到的理由
<17-3,MARGO>That is no excuse for being late.

532
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,160
<17-3,MARGO>你可不是还在堪萨斯了  托托
<17-3,MARGO>You are not in Kansas anymore, Toto...

533
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,040
<17-4,CASTLE>给我一枪吧
<17-4,CASTLE>Shoot me now.

534
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,780
<17-5,MARTHA>天呐  真希望我那时有这种真人秀
<17-5,MARTHA>Boy, I wish I'd had these reality shows in my day.

535
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,530
<17-5,MARTHA>没剧本  表演夸张
<17-5,MARTHA>No script, overacting,

536
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,470
<17-5,MARTHA>可以对别人乱吼  多好的演出啊
<17-5,MARTHA>screaming at everybody-- what a gig.

537
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,760
<17-6,MARGO>我新写了一份广告
<17-6,MARGO>Now I have written new promo copy.

538
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,240
<17-6,MARGO>校对一遍
<17-6,MARGO>Proofread it.

539
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,190
<17-7,PENELOPE>你们两个怎么了
<17-7,PENELOPE>So what's going on between you two?

<17-9,PENELOPE>You're sleeping with her, aren't you, Bob?

<17-11,PENELOPE>Don't lie to me.

545
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,950
<17-11,PENELOPE>你在搞她  承认吧
<17-11,PENELOPE>You're screwing Hannah! Admit it.

546
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,770
<17-11,PENELOPE>承认啊
<17-11,PENELOPE>Admit it!

<21-1,BECKETT>I was doing rounds when I saw her go into 29-J.

654
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,100
<22-1,BECKETT>29J的户主是谁
<22-1,BECKETT>And who owns 29-J?

655
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,160
<22-1,BECKETT>海洋平台控股公司
<22-1,BECKETT>Ocean Terrace Holdings. It's a corporation.

656
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,570
<22-1,BECKETT>旗下有没有注册人名
<22-1,BECKETT>Is there a name listed on it?

657
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,990
<22-1,BECKETT>没有  现在有很多人都用
<22-1,BECKETT>Uh, no. A lot of people buy units

658
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,770
<22-1,BECKETT>公司的名字进行租赁  以保护隐私
<22-1,BECKETT>under corporate names for privacy, so...

659
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,990
<24-1,BECKETT>等等  你们听到了吗
<24-1,BECKETT>Wait. Wait. Wait. Do you hear that?

660
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,180
<24-2,CASTLE>好像有人在捶墙
<24-2,CASTLE>Sounds like someone pounding on a wall.

661
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,770
<24-3,BECKETT>佩内洛普
<24-3,BECKETT>Penelope?

662
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
<24-4,CASTLE>鲍勃
<24-4,CASTLE>And Bob?!

663
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,270
<24-4,CASTLE>你们俩又合
<24-4,CASTLE>You two are back toge--

664
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,090
<24-4,CASTLE>提示  有剧透
<24-4,CASTLE>Spoiler alert.

665
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,010
<25-1,GATES>鲍勃和佩内洛普在一起
<25-1,GATES>Bob and Penelope together?

666
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,330
<25-1,GATES>我简直不敢相信
<25-1,GATES>I can't believe it.

667
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,470
<25-2,CASTLE>就是说嘛
<25-2,CASTLE>I know, right?

668
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,040
<25-3,BECKETT>他俩对汉娜闭口不谈
<25-3,BECKETT>Neither of them is talking about Hannah.

669
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,930
<25-4,GATES>显然他俩除了滚床单之外
<25-4,GATES>Well, clearly they have a lot more to hide

670
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,650
<25-4,GATES>还有别的事情瞒着我们
<25-4,GATES>than the fact that they were sleeping together.

671
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,050
<25-5,CASTLE>这个故事转折点我可没猜到
<25-5,CASTLE>Well, this is a plot twist I didn't see coming.

672
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,090
<25-6,RYAN>我查了一下那栋公寓
<25-6,RYAN>Hey, so I did some digging on the apartment.

673
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,360
<25-6,RYAN>海洋平台控股  是鲍勃的一个
<25-6,RYAN>Ocean Terrance Holdings, it's a shell company

674
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,510
<25-6,RYAN>空壳公司
<25-6,RYAN>owned by Bob.

675
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,370
<25-6,RYAN>是在他跟汉娜有外遇之后租下的
<25-6,RYAN>The lease began just after he and Hannah started their affair.

676
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
<25-7,GATES>真奇怪
<25-7,GATES>That's odd.

677
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,650
<25-7,GATES>鲍勃离开佩内洛普之后
<25-7,GATES>When Bob left Penelope,

678
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:28,310
<25-7,GATES>他跟汉娜住进了汤姆森酒店
<25-7,GATES>he moved into the Thompson Hotel with Hannah.

679
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,830
<25-7,GATES>为什么还要租一个公寓
<25-7,GATES>So why would he lease another apartment?

680
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,910
<25-9,ESPOSITO>我查了佩内洛普的财产情况
<25-9,ESPOSITO>I looked into Penelope's financials.

681
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,930
<25-9,ESPOSITO>还记得汉娜每周五千块的收入吧
<25-9,ESPOSITO>Remember those $5,000 payments that Hannah got?

682
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,880
<25-9,ESPOSITO>这与佩内洛普从支票账户上
<25-9,ESPOSITO>They line up exactly with withdrawals that Penelope made

683
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,820
<25-9,ESPOSITO>支付的数额一样
<25-9,ESPOSITO>from her checking account.

684
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,160
<25-10,GATES>付钱给汉娜的人是佩内洛普
<25-10,GATES>Penelope was paying hannah?

685
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,960
<25-10,GATES>为什么
<25-10,GATES>Wh-why would she do that?

686
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,660
<25-11,BECKETT>除非她开口  否则我们没辙了
<25-11,BECKETT>There's no way to know unless we get her to talk.

687
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,590
<25-12,CASTLE>不好意思  你没看节目吗
<25-12,CASTLE>I'm s--I'm sorry. Have you seen the show?

688
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,540
<25-12,CASTLE>佩内洛普是强势的那一方
<25-12,CASTLE>Penelope is the strong one.

689
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,860
<25-12,CASTLE>想要知道实情
<25-12,CASTLE>If anyone's gonna talk...

690
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,010
<25-12,CASTLE>得问鲍勃
<25-12,CASTLE>it's Bob.

691
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,030
<25-13,BECKETT>可他也不说
<25-13,BECKETT>But he's not.

692
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,270
<25-13,BECKETT>我猜他定是害怕佩内洛普
<25-13,BECKETT>And my guess is, he's afraid of Penelope.

693
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,470
<25-14,CASTLE>看来是时候
<25-14,CASTLE>Well, then perhaps it's time

694
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,800
<25-14,CASTLE>按照佩内洛普的招数出手了
<25-14,CASTLE>to tear a page from Penelope's play book.

695
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,420
<25-15,BECKETT>拜托  你们不会是让我
<25-15,BECKETT>Oh, come on. You guys aren't actually--

696
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,250
<25-16,GATES>又不会少块肉
<25-16,GATES>Couldn't hurt.

697
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,320
<26-1,BOB>我都告诉你们  我没什么好
<26-1,BOB>I told you, I have nothing to--

698
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,430
<26-2,BECKETT>我说你可以讲话了吗
<26-2,BECKETT>Did I say you could talk?

699
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,970
<26-3,BECKETT>谁告诉你  你可以张开那张破嘴了
<26-3,BECKETT>Did someone give you permission to open your sorry little mouth?

700
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,730
<26-3,BECKETT>没人
<26-3,BECKETT>No!

701
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,380
<26-3,BECKETT>给我坐好  闭嘴  好好听着
<26-3,BECKETT>So sit down, shut up, and listen.

702
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,400
<26-3,BECKETT>我们知道公寓是你的  鲍勃
<26-3,BECKETT>We know that apartment's yours, Bob.

703
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,140
<26-3,BECKETT>我们知道汉娜曾经被困在那里
<26-3,BECKETT>We know that Hannah was held hostage there,

704
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,640
<26-3,BECKETT>也就是说
<26-3,BECKETT>which means...

705
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,550
<26-3,BECKETT>我可以用绑架罪名起诉你
<26-3,BECKETT>I can nail you for kidnapping.

706
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,340
<26-3,BECKETT>那足以让你蹲起码20年大牢
<26-3,BECKETT>That's 20 years, easy.

707
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,790
<26-5,BECKETT>-什么  不  我  -可我不会就此罢休
<26-5,BECKETT>- What? No. I-- - But you know what? I'm not gonna stop there.

708
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,780
<26-5,BECKETT>我要让你背上谋杀的罪名
<26-5,BECKETT>I am going to fry you for murder.

709
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,720
<26-6,BOB>等等  我  我没杀她
<26-6,BOB>Wait. Me? I-I didn't kill her.

710
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,070
<26-6,BOB>不许说谎
<26-6,BOB>Don't lie to me!

711
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,060
<26-7,BECKETT>你绑了她
<26-7,BECKETT>You locked her up.

712
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,910
<26-7,BECKETT>扣押她
<26-7,BECKETT>You held her hostage.

713
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,610
<26-7,BECKETT>有谁会对自己爱的人做这样的事
<26-7,BECKETT>Who does that to someone that they love,

714
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,290
<26-7,BECKETT>你这个满口谎言的...
<26-7,BECKETT>you lying sack of...

715
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,440
<26-8,BOB>我们没有相爱  好吧
<26-8,BOB>We weren't in love, okay?!

716
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,660
<26-8,BOB>这是个谎言  这件事都是
<26-8,BOB>It was a lie. The whole thing was a lie.

717
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,170
<26-8,BOB>我们没有交往过
<26-8,BOB>There was no relationship.

718
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,010
<26-8,BOB>汉娜跟我从来没有交往过
<26-8,BOB>Hannah and I were never even together.

719
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,100
<26-9,GATES>什么
<26-9,GATES>What?!

720
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,030
<26-11,BOB>我们为了收视率才那么说的
<26-11,BOB>We only did it for the ratings.

721
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,340
<26-12,BECKETT>收视率
<26-12,BECKETT>The ratings?

722
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,060
<26-13,BOB>阿什莉和斯通的订婚
<26-13,BOB>Ashley and Stone's engagement

723
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,190
<26-13,BOB>吸引了所有人的注意
<26-13,BOB>was sucking up all the attention on the show.

724
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
<26-13,BOB>佩内洛普的上镜时间在减少
<26-13,BOB>Penelope's screen time was dropping,

725
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,320
<26-13,BOB>这使她的服装销量锐减
<26-13,BOB>which was killing her clothing sales.

726
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,870
<26-13,BOB>她快疯了
<26-13,BOB>She was out of her mind.

727
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,670
<26-13,BOB>于是我们想出了一个计划
<26-13,BOB>So we came up with a plan.

728
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,620
<26-13,BOB>汉娜一开始不太情愿
<26-13,BOB>Hannah was reluctant at first,

729
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,270
<26-13,BOB>佩内洛普很有说服力
<26-13,BOB>but Penelope can be pretty persuasive.

730
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,660
<26-14,BECKETT>所以佩内洛普付给汉娜的五千美金
<26-14,BECKETT>So the $5,000 that Penelope was paying Hannah,

731
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,560
<26-14,BECKETT>是为了伪造你们的关系
<26-14,BECKETT>that was to fake a relationship?

732
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,890
<26-15,BOB>我们也没想到会这样
<26-15,BOB>We never intended for it to end like this.

733
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,070
<26-16,BECKETT>发生了什么  鲍勃
<26-16,BECKETT>What happened, Bob?

734
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,080
<26-16,BECKETT>那天晚上
<26-16,BECKETT>The other night,

735
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,060
<26-17,BOB>录完她的自白
<26-17,BOB>after taping her confessional,

736
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,490
<26-17,BOB>汉娜说她想谈谈
<26-17,BOB>Hannah said she needed to talk.

737
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,250
<26-17,BOB>但是不能让其他人看见我们三个在一起
<26-17,BOB>Well, the three of us couldn't be seen together,

738
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,740
<26-17,BOB>所以我们就约在了公寓
<26-17,BOB>so we met at the apartment.

739
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,090
<26-17,BOB>她告诉我们
<26-17,BOB>She told us she couldn't bear

740
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,860
<26-17,BOB>她不想再让别人认为她是第三者
<26-17,BOB>everyone thinking she was this home wrecker.

741
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,550
<26-17,BOB>她不能继续撒谎
<26-17,BOB>She couldn't go on living a lie.

742
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,620
<26-17,BOB>她说她要公开
<26-17,BOB>Yeah, she said she was gonna go public,

743
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,010
<26-17,BOB>揭露这段婚外情都是假的
<26-17,BOB>reveal the affair had been faked all along.

744
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,540
<26-18,BECKETT>这可是令人震惊的消息  你们做了什么
<26-18,BECKETT>That's a pretty big bombshell. How'd you guys take it?

745
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,910
<26-19,BOB>我们慌了神
<26-19,BOB>How'd we take it? We panicked.

746
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,570
<26-19,BOB>如果我们让她那么做
<26-19,BOB>If we let her go through with it,

747
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,420
<26-19,BOB>会毁了这部秀的
<26-19,BOB>it would blow up the show.

748
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,560
<26-19,BOB>没人会再相信我们
<26-19,BOB>We'd lose all creditability.

749
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,830
<26-19,BOB>也再没有人会买佩内洛普的衣服了
<26-19,BOB>No one would buy Penelope's clothes anymore.

750
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,370
<26-19,BOB>再说  我们违反了合同
<26-19,BOB>Plus, we'd be in breach of contract

751
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,430
<26-19,BOB>节目可以指控我们赔偿到倾家荡产
<26-19,BOB>and the show could sue us for every cent we had.

752
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,470
<26-19,BOB>我们的生活都会被毁了
<26-19,BOB>Our whole lives would be ruined.

753
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,920
<26-20,BECKETT>所以你们就把她绑了起来
<26-20,BECKETT>So then you guys tied her up.

754
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,050
<26-21,BOB>我们不知道该怎么做
<26-21,BOB>We didn't know what to do.

755
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,280
<26-21,BOB>就这么过了一天
<26-21,BOB>So a whole day went by.

756
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,320
<26-21,BOB>我们意识到不可能永远困着她
<26-21,BOB>We realized we couldn't hold her forever s--

757
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,180
<26-21,BOB>所以我们打了个电话
<26-21,BOB>So we made a call.

758
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,230
<26-22,BECKETT>打给谁了
<26-22,BECKETT>So who'd you call?

759
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,140
<26-22,BECKETT>鲍勃
<26-22,BECKETT>Bob!

760
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,740
<26-22,BECKETT>打给谁了
<26-22,BECKETT>Who'd you call?

761
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,630
<26-23,BOB>彼得·门罗
<26-23,BOB>Peter Monroe.

762
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,610
<26-24,BECKETT>《华尔街之妻》制作人
<26-24,BECKETT>The "Wives of Wall Street" producer?

763
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,780
<26-25,BOB>我们需要帮助
<26-25,BOB>Yeah, we needed help.

764
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,120
<26-25,BOB>这是他的节目  他和我们一样输不起
<26-25,BOB>It's his show. He had as much to lose as we did.

765
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,060
<26-26,BECKETT>你怎么跟他说的
<26-26,BECKETT>What did you tell him?

766
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,790
<26-26,BECKETT>一切
<26-26,BECKETT>Everything.

767
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,430
<26-27,BOB>然后他过来  让我和佩内洛普先走
<26-27,BOB>Then he came over and told Penelope and me to leave,

768
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,830
<26-27,BOB>他说他会处理汉娜的事
<26-27,BOB>that he would handle Hannah.

769
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,070
<26-27,BOB>我们以为他会晓之以情动之以理
<26-27,BOB>We thought he was just gonna talk some sense into her,

770
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,080
<26-27,BOB>也许给她涨工资啥的
<26-27,BOB>you know, maybe sweeten her deal.

771
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,800
<26-27,BOB>但是接下来我们听到的消息
<26-27,BOB>But the next thing we knew,

772
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,630
<26-27,BOB>是汉娜死了
<26-27,BOB>Hannah was dead.

773
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,880
<27-1,JEFF>抱歉  先生  我已经尽力阻止他们了
<27-1,JEFF>I'm so sorry, sir. I tried to stop them.

774
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,200
<27-2,PETER>-杰夫  出去  -好
<27-2,PETER>- Jeff, get outta here. - Right.

775
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,860
<27-3,JEFF>门罗先生  你是不是患有
<27-3,JEFF>Mr. Monroe, are you pathologically incapable

776
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,180
<27-4,BECKETT>病态说谎症
<27-4,BECKETT>of telling the truth?

777
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,670
<27-5,PETER>这个要看情况  什么事
<27-5,PETER>Well, that depends. What's this about?

778
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,730
<27-6,CASTLE>你在汉娜谋杀案中扮演的角色
<27-6,CASTLE>Your role in Hannah's murder.

779
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,240
<27-7,PETER>她的死跟我一点关系都没有
<27-7,PETER>Whoa. I had nothing to do with her murder.

780
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,070
<27-8,BECKETT>鲍勃认为是你做的
<27-8,BECKETT>Bob thinks you did.

781
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,160
<27-8,BECKETT>我们知道在汉娜死前  他在公寓
<27-8,BECKETT>We know about him calling you from the apartment

782
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,770
<27-8,BECKETT>给你打电话说明了她的情况
<27-8,BECKETT>about Hannah just before she died.

783
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,050
<27-9,PETER>好吧  佩内洛普和鲍勃打给我了
<27-9,PETER>Okay, Penelope and Bob called me.

784
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,400
<27-9,PETER>一对傻瓜
<27-9,PETER>Couple of moron idiots...

785
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,410
<27-9,PETER>那样挟持着她
<27-9,PETER>Taking her hostage like that.

786
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,500
<27-10,CASTLE>这么说你去了
<27-10,CASTLE>So you went over there?

787
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,850
<27-11,PETER>我当然去了
<27-11,PETER>Of course I went over there.

788
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,560
<27-11,PETER>我从那两个疯子手里救了她
<27-11,PETER>Hell, I saved her from those two lunatics.

789
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,370
<27-11,PETER>我可是好人
<27-11,PETER>I'm the good guy.

790
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,880
<27-11,PETER>你们知道我去做了什么吗
<27-11,PETER>You know what I did when I got there?

791
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,490
<27-11,PETER>我放她走了  要水吗
<27-11,PETER>I let her go. Water?

792
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,130
<27-11,PETER>要的
<27-11,PETER>Please.

793
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,740
<27-12,CASTLE>如果汉娜曝光婚外情是假的
<27-12,CASTLE>Look, if Hannah exposed that your main storyline was faked,

794
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,710
<27-12,CASTLE>你的节目就会一落千丈
<27-12,CASTLE>your show would go down in flames.

795
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,930
<27-13,CASTLE>粉丝们会大怒
<27-13,CASTLE>The fans would be outraged.

796
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,130
<27-13,CASTLE>我就很愤怒
<27-13,CASTLE>Hell, I'm outraged.

797
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,400
<27-14,PETER>我试着阻止她
<27-14,PETER>I was trying to stop her.

798
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,970
<27-14,PETER>我打算给她更多的钱  以她为主角开发新剧
<27-14,PETER>I offered Hannah more money, her own series,

799
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,110
<27-14,PETER>给她想要的一切
<27-14,PETER>anything she wanted

800
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,600
<27-14,PETER>只要她闭上嘴
<27-14,PETER>to not blow the lid off the show.

801
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,380
<27-14,PETER>我是说
<27-14,PETER>I mean...

802
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,910
<27-14,PETER>她会毁了一切
<27-14,PETER>She was gonna ruin everything.

803
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,480
<27-14,PETER>我求她留下
<27-14,PETER>I begged her to stay.

804
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,450
<27-14,PETER>我跟着她  提供给她我能给予的一切提议
<27-14,PETER>I followed her out and gave her every decent pitch I had.

805
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,430
<27-14,PETER>但是她不同意
<27-14,PETER>But she wouldn't deal.

806
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,690
<27-14,PETER>她坐进出租车  那之后我就没见过她
<27-14,PETER>She got into a taxi, and I never saw her again.

807
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,190
<27-15,BECKETT>有个更好的版本
<27-15,BECKETT>Here's a better story--

808
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,820
<27-15,BECKETT>你抓起一把刀  跟着她
<27-15,BECKETT>You grabbed a knife and you followed her.

809
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,880
<27-15,BECKETT>不  我没有  我发誓
<27-15,BECKETT>No, I didn't. I swear.

810
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,480
<27-16,PETER>我去了玩家俱乐部
<27-16,PETER>I went straight to the player's club,

811
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,830
<27-16,PETER>点了几杯鸡尾酒
<27-16,PETER>ordered a couple of cocktails,

812
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,810
<27-16,PETER>等着我的世界开始崩落
<27-16,PETER>and waited for my world to start to cave in.

813
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,470
<27-16,PETER>但是什么事也没发生
<27-16,PETER>But nothing happened.

814
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,930
<27-16,PETER>第二天早上  我得知她死了
<27-16,PETER>Next morning, I found out that she was dead.

815
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,700
<28-1,BECKETT>玩家俱乐部的经理证实
<28-1,BECKETT>So the manager at the player's club confirms

816
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,830
<28-1,BECKETT>门罗从晚上十点直到午夜后
<28-1,BECKETT>that Monroe was there from 10:00 p.m.

817
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,190
<28-1,BECKETT>都在那里
<28-1,BECKETT>till well after midnight.

818
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,180
<28-1,BECKETT>他不是凶手
<28-1,BECKETT>He's not our guy.

819
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,970
<28-2,CASTLE>那就只剩玛格了
<28-2,CASTLE>Which leaves Margo,

820
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,360
<28-2,CASTLE>因为汉娜后来去了那里  但是
<28-2,CASTLE>because that's where Hannah went next, but...

821
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,480
<15-1,BECKETT>在被挟持那么久之后
<15-1,BECKETT>after being held hostage

822
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,940
<28-1,BECKETT>还提出辞演
<28-1,BECKETT>and demanding to leave the show,

823
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,470
<28-2,CASTLE>我很怀疑她会重新回去工作
<28-2,CASTLE>I doubt she went there to recommit to the job.

824
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,930
<28-2,CASTLE>玛格之前一定骗了我们
<28-2,CASTLE>Margo had to have been lying to us.

825
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,370
<28-3,ESPOSITO>玛格的确说谎了
<28-3,ESPOSITO>Margo was lying, all right.

826
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,310
<28-3,ESPOSITO>她告诉你们那天晚上她放汉娜进了楼
<28-3,ESPOSITO>She told you she buzzed up Hannah that night, right?

827
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,610
<28-5,ESPOSITO>那不可能
<28-5,ESPOSITO>That's impossible.

828
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,580
<28-5,ESPOSITO>那楼里的安保系统连着她的手机
<28-5,ESPOSITO>The buzzer on the building connects through her phone.

829
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,700
<28-5,ESPOSITO>根据电话记录
<28-5,ESPOSITO>According to the phone records,

830
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,620
<28-5,ESPOSITO>汉娜是9:57进到楼里的
<28-5,ESPOSITO>Hannah was buzzed up at 9:57 p.m.

831
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,500
<28-5,ESPOSITO>根据玛格的财务记录
<28-5,ESPOSITO>Well, according to Margo's financials,

832
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,400
<28-5,ESPOSITO>几乎在同时  9:58
<28-5,ESPOSITO>at almost exactly the same time, 9:58 p.m.,

833
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,270
<28-5,ESPOSITO>她在几个街区外的
<28-5,ESPOSITO>she was using her credit card

834
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,910
<28-5,ESPOSITO>洛伦佐熟食店使用信用卡
<28-5,ESPOSITO>at Lorenzo's deli ten blocks away.

835
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,710
<28-6,BECKETT>谢谢  埃斯波
<28-6,BECKETT>Thanks, Espo.

836
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,090
<28-6,BECKETT>玛格要好好解释一番了
<28-6,BECKETT>Margo's got some explaining to do.

837
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,260
<28-6,BECKETT>如果她没让汉娜进门  那谁开门了
<28-6,BECKETT>If she didn't buzz Hannah in, then who did?

838
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,640
<28-7,CASTLE>她为什么要说谎呢
<28-7,CASTLE>And why would she lie about it?

839
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,370
<28-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你今天和盖茨怎么了
<28-8,BECKETT>Castle, what's going on with you and Gates today?

840
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,720
<28-9,CASTLE>什么意思
<28-9,CASTLE>What do you mean?

841
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,380
<29-1,BECKETT>说真的  卡塞尔
<29-1,BECKETT>Seriously, Castle,

842
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,400
<29-1,BECKETT>你在想什么呢
<29-1,BECKETT>what were you thinking?

843
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,740
<29-2,CASTLE>我想要给你个惊喜
<29-2,CASTLE>Well, I wanted to surprise you.

844
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,650
<29-3,BECKETT>把我的礼物放在盖茨的上衣里吗
<29-3,BECKETT>By putting my gift in Gates' blazer?

845
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,590
<29-3,BECKETT>好吧  我被惊到了
<29-3,BECKETT>Okay, I'm surprised.

846
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,960
<29-4,CASTLE>为什么你和盖茨要穿相似的上衣呢
<29-4,CASTLE>Well, why do you and Gates have to wear such similar blazers?

847
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,700
<29-5,BECKETT>你留条了吗
<29-5,BECKETT>Did you write a note?

848
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,730
<29-6,CASTLE>我当然留条了啊  我可是作家
<29-6,CASTLE>Of course I wrote a note. I'm a writer.

849
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,590
<29-7,BECKETT>情话吗
<29-7,BECKETT>Was it romantic?

850
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,730
<29-8,CASTLE>情人节礼物  所以  当然是情话
<29-8,CASTLE>It's Valentine's Day, so, yeah, it was romantic.

851
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,860
<29-9,BECKETT>你写我名字了吗
<29-9,BECKETT>Did you put my name on it?

852
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,870
<29-10,BECKETT>天呐  卡塞尔  拜托  写我名字了吗
<29-10,BECKETT>Oh, god, Castle, please. Did you put my name on it?

853
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,810
<29-10,BECKETT>我不记得了
<29-10,BECKETT>I can't remember.

854
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,250
<29-11,CASTLE>我写了自己名字  我只记得这么多
<29-11,CASTLE>I put my name on it. I know that much.

855
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,530
<29-12,BECKETT>要是盖茨发现我们在交往
<29-12,BECKETT>If Gates finds out that we're dating,

856
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,130
<29-12,BECKETT>那就完了
<29-12,BECKETT>then that's it.

857
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,850
<29-12,BECKETT>我们就不能一起工作了
<29-12,BECKETT>We're not gonna be working together anymore.

858
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,250
<29-13,CASTLE>所以说我再努力拿回来嘛
<29-13,CASTLE>Why do you think I've been trying so hard to get it back?

859
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,410
<29-14,BECKETT>我们会拿回来的
<29-14,BECKETT>Oh, we will get it back,

860
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,980
<29-14,BECKETT>一回到警局就去拿
<29-14,BECKETT>right when we get to the precinct.

861
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,970
<29-14,BECKETT>但现在我们有谋杀案要破
<29-14,BECKETT>But right now we got a murder to solve.

862
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,660
<29-14,BECKETT>也许是最后一案
<29-14,BECKETT>Maybe our last.

863
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,150
<30-1,MARGO>请进
<30-1,MARGO>Come in.

864
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,950
<30-2,BECKETT>谢谢你让我们进来
<30-2,BECKETT>Thanks for buzzing us in.

865
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,600
<30-3,MARGO>有什么我能做的吗
<30-3,MARGO>What can I do for you?

866
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,420
<30-4,BECKETT>你知道这栋楼有趣的一点就是
<30-4,BECKETT>You know, the interesting thing about this building

867
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,400
<30-4,BECKETT>与你手机相连接的大门保安系统
<30-4,BECKETT>is that the buzzer system runs through your telephone.

868
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,410
<30-5,MARGO>然后呢
<30-5,MARGO>So?

869
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,310
<30-6,BECKETT>每次有访客获准进入
<30-6,BECKETT>So anytime someone gets buzzed up,

870
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,310
<30-6,BECKETT>手机就会把时间记录下来
<30-6,BECKETT>it gets time stamped.

871
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,370
<30-6,BECKETT>既然我们知道你在洛伦佐熟食店购物
<30-6,BECKETT>And since we know you were at Lorenzo's deli buying onions,

872
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,750
<30-6,BECKETT>你不可能在凶案发生当晚
<30-6,BECKETT>you couldn't have buzzed Hannah up

873
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,820
<30-6,BECKETT>放汉娜进入大楼
<30-6,BECKETT>the night of the murder.

874
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,090
<30-7,CASTLE>这意味着放她进来的另有其人
<30-7,CASTLE>Which means somebody else did.

875
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,240
<30-7,CASTLE>你为什么要对我们撒谎
<30-7,CASTLE>Why did you lie to us?

876
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,520
<30-7,CASTLE>看了节目  我知道
<30-7,CASTLE>From watching the show, I know that

877
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,210
<30-7,CASTLE>你的丈夫在布鲁塞尔谈生意
<30-7,CASTLE>your husband is in Brussels working on a deal.

878
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,010
<30-7,CASTLE>不可能是他
<30-7,CASTLE>So it couldn't have been him,

879
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,530
<30-7,CASTLE>那就只剩下一个人
<30-7,CASTLE>which leaves only one other person living in this house.

880
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,490
<30-8,BECKETT>你的儿子斯通
<30-8,BECKETT>Your son Stone.

881
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,330
<30-8,BECKETT>他和汉娜一起工作  对吗
<30-8,BECKETT>He worked with Hannah, didn't he?

882
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,060
<30-9,MARGO>我不喜欢你的言外之意
<30-9,MARGO>I don't like what you're implying.

883
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,210
<30-10,CASTLE>他们之间有矛盾吗
<30-10,CASTLE>Were they having problems with each other?

884
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,480
<30-11,BECKETT>斯通在哪里  戈尔太太
<30-11,BECKETT>Where is Stone right now, Ms. Gower?

885
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,630
<30-12,MARGO>我又不知道  他都是成年人了
<30-12,MARGO>I don't know. He's an adult.

886
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,890
<30-13,CASTLE>是吗  因为在第三季第五集里
<30-13,CASTLE>Really? Because in Season Three, Episode Five,

887
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,780
<30-13,CASTLE>你说你是你儿子的看护人
<30-13,CASTLE>You said that you are your son's keeper,

888
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,420
<30-13,CASTLE>永远知道他在哪  在做什么
<30-13,CASTLE>always knowing where he is and what he's doing.

889
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,300
<30-13,CASTLE>看起来有人做好了功课
<30-13,CASTLE>Looks like one of us did their homework.

890
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,510
<30-13,CASTLE>戈尔太太  斯通在哪
<30-13,CASTLE>Now, Ms. Gower, where is Stone?

891
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,270
<30-14,MARGO>我想和我的律师谈谈
<30-14,MARGO>I would like to talk to my attorney.

892
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,450
<30-15,BECKETT>娱乐律师还是刑事律师
<30-15,BECKETT>Entertainment or criminal?

893
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,120
<31-1,RYAN>长官  我们找到他了
<31-1,RYAN>Yeah. Sir, we got him.

894
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,990
<31-2,GATES>他要去哪里
<31-2,GATES>Where's he headed?

895
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,800
<31-3,RYAN>斯通买了一张去布宜诺斯艾利斯的单程票
<31-3,RYAN>Stone bought a one-way ticket to Buenos Aires.

896
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,960
<31-3,RYAN>飞机一小时内起飞
<31-3,RYAN>Flight departs in an hour.

897
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,650
<31-4,GATES>鲍勃和佩内洛普假装分手
<31-4,GATES>Bob and Penelope fake their breakup,

898
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,940
<31-4,GATES>而现在无邪的斯通成了凶手
<31-4,GATES>and now poor sweet innocent Stone's a killer?

899
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,250
<31-4,GATES>真人秀上还有真的吗
<31-4,GATES>Is there anything real on that reality show?

900
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,200
<31-5,RYAN>看节目时我的头疼可是真的
<31-5,RYAN>Just the headache I get when I watch it.

901
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,780
<31-5,RYAN>通知运输安全局
<31-5,RYAN>Call T.S.A.

902
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
<31-6,GATES>别让他登机
<31-6,GATES>Do not let him get on that flight.

903
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,960
<31-6,GATES>老天
<31-6,GATES>Oh, my... god.

904
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,830
<32-1,BECKETT>为什么突然要去阿根廷  斯通
<32-1,BECKETT>Why the sudden trip to Argentina, Stone?

905
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,390
<32-2,STONE>我只是需要点儿时间静静
<32-2,STONE>I just needed a little time away.

906
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,650
<32-3,BECKETT>我们知道在被害的当晚
<32-3,BECKETT>We know that Hannah showed up at your apartment

907
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,520
<32-3,BECKETT>汉娜出现在你家
<32-3,BECKETT>the night that she was killed,

908
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,390
<32-3,BECKETT>我们也知道你让她进门了
<32-3,BECKETT>and we know that you let her in.

909
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,600
<32-4,CASTLE>但因为某些原因
<32-4,CASTLE>And then for some reason,

910
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,940
<32-4,CASTLE>你的妈妈却对此撒谎
<32-4,CASTLE>your mother lied about it.

911
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,700
<32-4,CASTLE>她为什么这么做
<32-4,CASTLE>Now why would she do that?

912
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,700
<32-5,BECKETT>是因为汉娜告诉你
<32-5,BECKETT>Was it because Hannah told you

913
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,380
<32-5,BECKETT>她要毁了节目
<32-5,BECKETT>that she was gonna blow up the show

914
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,560
<32-5,BECKETT>然后你突然看到自己梦想的
<32-5,BECKETT>and you suddenly saw your dreams

915
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,340
<32-5,BECKETT>阿什莉/斯通衍生剧就要灰飞烟灭
<32-5,BECKETT>of an Ashley/Stone spin-off going out the window?

916
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,720
<32-5,BECKETT>这是你妈妈撒谎的原因吗
<32-5,BECKETT>Is that why your mom lied?

917
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,840
<32-5,BECKETT>就因为你尾随汉娜出了门
<32-5,BECKETT>'cause you followed Hannah out of the apartment

918
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,700
<32-5,BECKETT>然后杀了她
<32-5,BECKETT>and you killed her?

919
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,790
<32-6,STONE>我没有杀她
<32-6,STONE>I didn't kill her.

920
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,960
<32-6,STONE>你们不明白吗
<32-6,STONE>Don't you guys get it?

921
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,510
<32-6,STONE>我爱上了她
<32-6,STONE>I was in love with her.

922
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,690
<32-7,CASTLE>哇  爱
<32-7,CASTLE>Whoa. Love?

923
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,670
<32-7,CASTLE>那阿什莉呢
<32-7,CASTLE>What about Ashley?

924
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,210
<32-8,STONE>那是我妈妈的主意
<32-8,STONE>That was my mom's idea.

925
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,300
<32-8,STONE>我喜欢阿什
<32-8,STONE>Look, I like Ash.

926
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,980
<32-8,STONE>我们从小就认识
<32-8,STONE>We've known each other since we were kids.

927
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,540
<32-8,STONE>但是
<32-8,STONE>But...

928
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,640
<32-8,STONE>之后我遇见了汉娜
<32-8,STONE>Then I met Hannah.

929
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,310
<32-8,STONE>我们被迫成戴上假面
<32-8,STONE>We bonded over being forced into things

930
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,240
<32-8,STONE>我们同病相怜
<32-8,STONE>that weren't really us.

931
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,400
<32-9,BECKETT>还有人知道你们之间的事吗
<32-9,BECKETT>Did anyone else know about the two of you?

932
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,570
<32-9,BECKETT>没有
<32-9,BECKETT>No.

933
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,010
<32-10,STONE>坦白我们的关系风险太大
<32-10,STONE>There's too much at stake.

934
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,130
<32-10,STONE>过去的几周
<32-10,STONE>For the past few weeks,

935
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,990
<32-10,STONE>汉娜忍无可忍
<32-10,STONE>Hannah just couldn't take it anymore,

936
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,100
<32-10,STONE>节目对她和家庭产生了致命的影响
<32-10,STONE>what the show was doing to her, her family.

937
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,060
<32-11,CASTLE>她在寻找一条出路
<32-11,CASTLE>She was looking for a way out.

938
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,050
<32-12,STONE>我们都是
<32-12,STONE>We both were.

939
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,040
<32-12,STONE>但是谎言
<32-12,STONE>But the lies had just...

940
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,960
<32-12,STONE>越说越大
<32-12,STONE>gotten so big--

941

<32-12,STONE>她的假婚外情  我的订婚
<32-12,STONE>Her fake affair, my engagement.

<32-12,STONE>Ash and my mom...

943
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,630
<32-12,STONE>她们一直惦记着衍生剧
<32-12,STONE>They were counting on that spin-off.

944
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,060
<32-13,BECKETT>汉娜去找你那晚究竟发生了什么
<32-13,BECKETT>What happened the night that Hannah showed up?

945
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,330
<32-14,STONE>她很激动
<32-14,STONE>She was hysterical.

946
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,100
<32-14,STONE>她说想现在就离开
<32-14,STONE>She said she wanted to leave town right away,

947
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,110
<32-14,STONE>机不可失  时不再来
<32-14,STONE>That it was now or never.

948
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,830
<32-14,STONE>我也打算走  但是
<32-14,STONE>And I was going to, but...

<32-15,BECKETT>但是怎么了
<32-15,BECKETT>But what?

950
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,450
<32-16,STONE>我妈妈回家了
<32-16,STONE>Then my mom came home.

951
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,930
<32-16,STONE>她发现了我们的关系
<32-16,STONE>When she found out about our relationship,

952
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,000
<32-16,STONE>她发疯了
<32-16,STONE>She went crazy.

953
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,210
<32-16,STONE>她把汉娜赶了出去
<32-16,STONE>She threw Hannah out.

954
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,380
<32-16,STONE>但是最糟的是
<32-16,STONE>But the worst part...

955
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,150
<32-16,STONE>汉娜求我
<32-16,STONE>was that Hannah begged me

956
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,640
<32-16,STONE>和她一起走
<32-16,STONE>to go with her.

957
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,720
<32-16,STONE>但是我没有
<32-16,STONE>But I couldn't.

958
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,180
<32-16,STONE>在她需要我
<32-16,STONE>In the moment when she needed me

959
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,900
<32-16,STONE>反抗我妈妈的时候
<32-16,STONE>to stand up to my mother...

960
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,150
<32-16,STONE>我没有
<32-16,STONE>I couldn't.

961
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,630
<32-17,CASTLE>斯通
<32-17,CASTLE>Stone...

962
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,070
<32-17,CASTLE>你妈妈去追她了吗
<32-17,CASTLE>Did your mother go after her?

963
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,010
<32-17,CASTLE>没有
<32-17,CASTLE>No.

964
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,880
<32-18,STONE>汉娜一走
<32-18,STONE>As soon as Hannah left,

965
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,260
<32-18,STONE>我就知道自己铸成了大错
<32-18,STONE>I knew I'd made a mistake.

966
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:26,020
<32-18,STONE>所以我就追她到了街上
<32-18,STONE>So I ran out to catch up with her in the street.

967
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,630
<32-18,STONE>然后吻了她
<32-18,STONE>And I kissed her.

968
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,270
<32-18,STONE>我告诉她我爱她
<32-18,STONE>And I told her I loved her.

969
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,970
<32-18,STONE>但是她说为时已晚
<32-18,STONE>But she said it was too late...

970
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,780
<32-18,STONE>她再也不想见到我和我妈妈
<32-18,STONE>that she never wanted to see any of us again.

971
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,070
<32-19,BECKETT>有人能证明你在哪吗
<32-19,BECKETT>Can anyone verify your whereabouts

972
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,370
<32-19,BECKETT>在你和汉娜分开之后
<32-19,BECKETT>after you and Hannah went your separate ways?

973
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,490
<32-20,STONE>我独自散步  所以  没人
<32-20,STONE>I took a long walk, so, no.

974
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,160
<33-1,GATES>你怎么看  你相信他吗
<33-1,GATES>So what do you think? You believe him?

975
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,490
<33-2,CASTLE>他有动机  她离开了他
<33-2,CASTLE>He had motive. She was leaving him.

976
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,080
<33-3,BECKETT>而且他也是最后一个见到她活着的人
<33-3,BECKETT>And he was the last one to see her alive

977
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,010
<33-3,BECKETT>离她被害的地方只有一街区之遥  所以
<33-3,BECKETT>A block away from where she was killed, so...

978
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,620
<33-4,GATES>唯一的问题就是
<33-4,GATES>only problem is,

979
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,800
<33-4,GATES>我们没有任何证据
<33-4,GATES>We don't have any proof.

980
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,040
<33-4,GATES>我们无法把斯通和犯罪现场联系起来
<33-4,GATES>We can't tie Stone to the crime scene.

981
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,180
<33-5,RYAN>其实  我们可以
<33-5,RYAN>Actually, we can.

982
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,210
<33-5,RYAN>我凭着直觉查了他的新婚礼物清单
<33-5,RYAN>On a hunch, I took a look at his wedding registry.

983
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,770
<33-5,RYAN>阿什莉和斯通收到
<33-5,RYAN>It turns out that Ashley and Stone are registered

984
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,330
<33-5,RYAN>一套高原刀具
<33-5,RYAN>for a set of Takahara V.G. Knives,

985
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,810
<33-5,RYAN>包括三周前运到的
<33-5,RYAN>Including the 240 millimeter,

986
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,250
<33-5,RYAN>24厘米的刀具
<33-5,RYAN>which shipped out three weeks ago.

987
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,560
<33-6,CASTLE>实验报告确实说那是一把新刀
<33-6,CASTLE>The lab report did say that it was a new knife.

988
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:20,790
<33-7,GATES>那就可以结案了
<33-7,GATES>Then that seals it.

989
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,690
<33-8,BECKETT>不  不一定
<33-8,BECKETT>No, not necessarily.

990
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,400
<33-8,BECKETT>我们忘了婚礼礼仪
<33-8,BECKETT>We're forgetting wedding etiquette.

991
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,400
<33-8,BECKETT>礼物不是送去给新郎的
<33-8,BECKETT>The gifts don't go to the groom.

992
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,230
<34-1,BECKETT>谢谢你来  阿什莉
<34-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming, Ashley.

993
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,970
<34-2,ASHLEY>能帮上忙就好
<34-2,ASHLEY>Oh, anything I can do to help.

994
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,140
<34-3,BECKETT>你现在一定正忙着策划婚礼
<34-3,BECKETT>You must be so busy planning for the wedding right now

995
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,040
<34-3,BECKETT>处理所有新婚礼物
<34-3,BECKETT>and dealing with all of the gifts.

996
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,800
<34-4,ASHLEY>对的
<34-4,ASHLEY>Oh, yeah.

997
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,700
<34-5,BECKETT>我们知道你的表妹
<34-5,BECKETT>Well, we know that your cousin

998
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,520
<34-5,BECKETT>送给了一套高原刀具
<34-5,BECKETT>bought you that set of Takahara V.G. Knives,

999
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,330
<34-5,BECKETT>就是礼品清单上那一套
<34-5,BECKETT>The ones that you have on your registry.

1000
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,040
<34-6,ASHLEY>好吧
<34-6,ASHLEY>Okay.

1001
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,560
<34-7,CASTLE>有意思的是
<34-7,CASTLE>The funny thing is,

1002
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,380
<34-7,CASTLE>当我们去你家时
<34-7,CASTLE>when we went to your apartment,

1003
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,130
<34-7,CASTLE>你偏偏少了那把24厘米的刀具
<34-7,CASTLE>you don't have the 240 millimeter.

1004
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,310
<34-7,CASTLE>她竟然没送你一整套
<34-7,CASTLE>And isn't just a little weird

1005
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,540
<34-7,CASTLE>是不是有点可疑
<34-7,CASTLE>that she wouldn't get you the whole set?

1006
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,830
<34-8,ASHLEY>你们去了我家
<34-8,ASHLEY>You were in my apartment?

1007
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,720
<34-9,BECKETT>对  我们也去了你的陶瓷工作室
<34-9,BECKETT>Yeah, we also went to your ceramic studio as well.

1008
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,170
<34-10,CASTLE>顺便说一句  你的作品很出色
<34-10,CASTLE>Ah, your work is lovely, by the way.

1009
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,930
<34-10,CASTLE>釉彩的颜色光辉夺目
<34-10,CASTLE>The colors of your glazes are stunning.

1010
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,740
<34-10,CASTLE>我是说要很费力才能
<34-10,CASTLE>I mean, it must take a lot of work to get--

1011
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,370
<34-10,CASTLE>让成品完美无缺  要用化学品什么的
<34-10,CASTLE>to get them just right, like chemicals.

1012
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,600
<34-10,CASTLE>比如说
<34-10,CASTLE>Like the, um,

1013
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,300
<34-10,CASTLE>我们找到的氧化锑
<34-10,CASTLE>antimony oxide we found, for example.

1014
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,280
<34-10,CASTLE>那是干什么用的
<34-10,CASTLE>What is that for?

1015
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,960
<34-11,ASHLEY>是遮光剂  能够是物件不透明
<34-11,ASHLEY>It's an opacifier. It makes things opaque.

1016
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,820
<34-12,BECKETT>不过这反倒是让我们的案子明净起来
<34-12,BECKETT>Only in this case, it seems to make things clear.

1017
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,650
<34-12,BECKETT>我们在汉娜谋杀案中的凶器上
<34-12,BECKETT>The knife that was used in Hannah's murder,

1018
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,270
<34-12,BECKETT>发现了氧化锑残留
<34-12,BECKETT>we found traces of antimony oxide on it

1019
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,020
<34-12,BECKETT>你是留下的
<34-12,BECKETT>from you.

1020
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,420
<34-13,ASHLEY>不
<34-13,ASHLEY>No.

1021
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,300
<34-14,CASTLE>你在手机上收到了粉丝站的提示  对吧
<34-14,CASTLE>You got an alert on your phone from the fan site, didn't you?

1022
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,800
<34-14,CASTLE>汉娜在斯通公寓的那张照片
<34-14,CASTLE>That photo of Hannah at Stone's apartment--

1023
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,380
<34-14,CASTLE>你已经有所怀疑
<34-14,CASTLE>I mean, you already had your suspicions.

1024
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,580
<34-14,CASTLE>如今噩梦成真了
<34-14,CASTLE>You just confirmed your worst fears.

1025
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,880
<34-14,CASTLE>不不
<34-14,CASTLE>No. No.

1026
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,610
<34-15,ASHLEY>我不想谈了  我要走了
<34-15,ASHLEY>I think we're done here. I'm gonna go.

1027
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,250
<34-15,ASHLEY>借过
<34-15,ASHLEY>Excuse me.

1028
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,970
<34-16,ASHLEY>借过  我...得找到我的钥匙
<34-16,ASHLEY>Excuse me. I've just-- let me find my keys

1029
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,140
<34-16,ASHLEY>然后我就走
<34-16,ASHLEY>And I will go.

1030
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,470
<34-16,ASHLEY>好吧
<34-16,ASHLEY>Fine!

1031
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,410
<34-17,ASHLEY>我有所怀疑
<34-17,ASHLEY>I had my suspicions.

1032
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,390
<34-17,ASHLEY>看到照片后  我抓起刀
<34-17,ASHLEY>And when I saw that picture, I grabbed the knife,

1033
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,050
<34-17,ASHLEY>想吓吓她
<34-17,ASHLEY>just to scare her.

1034
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,020
<34-17,ASHLEY>我到了那之后  斯通在亲吻她
<34-17,ASHLEY>But when I got there, Stone was kissing her

1035
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,810
<34-17,ASHLEY>对她说他爱她
<34-17,ASHLEY>and saying he loved her.

1036
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,250
<34-17,ASHLEY>我不能让她夺走我的未婚夫
<34-17,ASHLEY>I couldn't just let her steal my fiance.

1037
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,860
<34-17,ASHLEY>我们的衍生剧正在进行最后的商议
<34-17,ASHLEY>Our spin-off was in final negotiations,  for god sakes.

1038
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,900
<34-17,ASHLEY>于是
<34-17,ASHLEY>So...

1039
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
<34-18,ASHLEY>在斯通走后
<34-18,ASHLEY>when Stone left,

1040
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,950
<34-18,ASHLEY>我跟踪了汉娜
<34-18,ASHLEY>I followed Hannah.

1041
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,520
<34-18,ASHLEY>消灭了威胁
<34-18,ASHLEY>I put an end to the threat.

1042
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,600
<35-1,BECKETT>下一代《华尔街之妻》
<35-1,BECKETT>The next generation of "The Wives of Wall Street,"

1043
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,430
<35-1,BECKETT>和阿什莉真是把抓马升级了啊
<35-1,BECKETT>and Ashley takes it to a whole new level.

1044
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,160
<35-2,CASTLE>或许她只是在循序自己的座右铭吧
<35-2,CASTLE>Well, maybe she was just following their motto--

1045
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,260
<35-2,CASTLE>"不要让任何人阻止你得到想要的东西"
<35-2,CASTLE>"Don't let anyone stop you from getting what you want."

1046
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,620
<35-3,BECKETT>弄得好像
<35-3,BECKETT>As if being on TV

1047
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,330
<35-3,BECKETT>上了电视她就不会自食其果了
<35-3,BECKETT>somehow made her immune to the consequences.

1048
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,260
<35-3,BECKETT>至少我们可以告诉汉娜的家人
<35-3,BECKETT>You know, at least we can tell Hannah's family

1049
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,150
<35-3,BECKETT>婚外情是假的
<35-3,BECKETT>that the affair wasn't real,

1050
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,550
<35-3,BECKETT>她打算回家
<35-3,BECKETT>that she was actually planning on going home.

1051
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,220
<35-3,BECKETT>说到后果
<35-3,BECKETT>Speaking of consequences...

1052
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,490
<35-3,BECKETT>为什么盖茨一声不吭
<35-3,BECKETT>why hasn't Gates said anything yet?

1053
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,620
<35-4,CASTLE>不知道
<35-4,CASTLE>Yeah, I don't know.

1054
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,040
<35-4,CASTLE>她要么是打算置之不理
<35-4,CASTLE>Maybe she's choosing to ignore it

1055
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,570
<35-4,CASTLE>要么是像鲨鱼一样等待时机
<35-4,CASTLE>or just biding her time like a shark.

1056
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,860
<35-5,RYAN>晚安  伙计们
<35-5,RYAN>Night, guys.

1057
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,190
<35-5,RYAN>情人节快乐
<35-5,RYAN>Happy Valentine's Day.

1058
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,070
<35-6,CASTLE>继续大战五十回合吗
<35-6,CASTLE>Ah, once more onto the breach?

1059
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,930
<35-7,RYAN>事实上  珍妮给我发短信了
<35-7,RYAN>Uh, actually, Jenny just texted me,

1060
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,080
<35-7,RYAN>今晚我可以养精蓄锐了
<35-7,RYAN>and I have the night off.

1061
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,350
<35-7,RYAN>不过我们还是会...
<35-7,RYAN>I mean, we'll probably still,

1062
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,200
<35-7,RYAN>你们懂的
<35-7,RYAN>uh, you know,

1063
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,440
<35-7,RYAN>不过今晚是为了浪漫
<35-7,RYAN>but tonight it will be for romantic reasons.

1064
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,640
<35-8,BECKETT>是啊
<35-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

1065
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,360
<35-9,BECKETT>埃斯波
<35-9,BECKETT>Hey, Espo.

1066
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,980
<35-9,BECKETT>你的女伴来了
<35-9,BECKETT>Your date's here.

1067
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,600
<35-10,CASTLE>我就知道他们有约
<35-10,CASTLE>I knew they had plans.

1068
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,340
<35-10,CASTLE>你知道却不告诉我
<35-10,CASTLE>You knew they had plans and you didn't tell me?

1069
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,500
<35-11,BECKETT>因为她要我保密
<35-11,BECKETT>Yeah, because she asked me to keep it a secret.

1070
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,030
<35-11,BECKETT>这对他们来说很重要
<35-11,BECKETT>This is a really big deal for them.

1071
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,280
<35-11,BECKETT>她不想让你吐槽他们
<35-11,BECKETT>She doesn't want you making fun of 'em.

1072
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,010
<35-12,CASTLE>我才不...是啊
<35-12,CASTLE>I wouldn't make fun-- no, that's...

1073
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,100
<35-12,CASTLE>铁定的
<35-12,CASTLE>that's not true. That'd be fish in a barrel.

1074
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,030
<35-13,CASTLE>蕾妮
<35-13,CASTLE>Lanie...

1075
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,010
<35-14,BECKETT>你美呆了
<35-14,BECKETT>You look great.

1076
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,230
<35-15,LANIE>不会太过火吗
