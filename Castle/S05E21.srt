<9-13,MAHONEY>我在安排让飞机接他们回来
<9-13,MAHONEY>I was arranging for my plane to bring them home.

114
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,140
<9-12,BECKETT>你非常慷慨  沃恩先生
<9-12,BECKETT>Well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Vaughn.

115
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,070
<9-12,BECKETT>请叫我埃里克  请问你是哪位
<9-12,BECKETT>No, please, call me Eric. And you are?

116
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,620
<9-12,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<9-12,BECKETT>Uh, I'm detective Kate Beckett.

117
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,410
<9-11,CASTLE>我是理查德·卡塞尔
<9-11,CASTLE>And I am Richard Castle.

118
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,990
<15-2,BECKETT>-是那位作家  -是的
<15-2,BECKETT>- Oh, the writer? - Yeah.

119
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,290
<15-2,BECKETT>我母亲很喜欢你的小说
<15-2,BECKETT>My mother loves your novels.

120
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,800
<15-2,BECKETT>我会送她签名版
<15-2,BECKETT>Oh, I'll get her an autographed copy.

121
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,740
<15-2,BECKETT>你跟被害人熟悉吗
<15-2,BECKETT>So how well did you know our victim?

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,940
<23-1,BECKETT>我们在生意上合作几年了
<23-1,BECKETT>We'd been doing business for many years.

123
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,640
<23-2,CASTLE>但恐怕不算熟悉
<23-2,CASTLE>But, uh, we weren't close, I'm afraid.

124
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,050
<8-4,RYAN>知道谁想要他死吗
<8-4,RYAN>Any idea who would want him dead?

125
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,300
<8-5,FOSSE>不知道  这件事太可怕了
<8-5,FOSSE>None. Uh, this-- this whole thing is terrible.

126
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,540
<24-14,CASTLE>贝克特
<24-14,CASTLE>Hey, Beckett.

127
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,880
<24-15,CASTLE>-抱歉  -没事
<24-15,CASTLE>- Excuse me. - Of course.

128
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,510
<24-16,CASTLE>通常情况下  只有少数服务员
<24-16,CASTLE>So normally only a handful of waitstaff

129
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,360
<24-17,CASTLE>可能接触到菜  但这次
<24-17,CASTLE>handle each entree, but in this case,

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,010
<24-17,CASTLE>有可能是外面的人做的
<24-17,CASTLE>it could've been somebody from the outside.

131
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,550
<19-1,BOYER>有一道厨房门强制打开了
<19-1,BOYER>There was a kitchen door propped open,

132
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,420
<24-6,CASTLE>鉴证组发现这件服务员的背心
<24-6,CASTLE>and C.S.U. found this waiter's vest

133
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,660
<24-6,CASTLE>藏在垃圾桶里
<24-6,CASTLE>stashed in a dumpster.

134
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,530
<23-1,BECKETT>好的  让警员排查这片区域
<23-1,BECKETT>Okay, have unis canvass the area,

135
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,910
<23-1,BECKETT>我要盘问所有的厨房人员
<23-1,BECKETT>And I'm gonna want to interview all of the kitchen staff as well.

136
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,810
<23-1,BECKETT>好的
<23-1,BECKETT>Right.

137
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,670
<23-1,BECKETT>是的
<23-1,BECKETT>Yes.

138
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,760
<23-1,BECKETT>怎么
<23-1,BECKETT>What?

139
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,500
<23-1,BECKETT>看来沃恩也在你的晚餐名单上
<23-1,BECKETT>Looks as though Vaughn is on your list as well.

140
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,250
<23-1,BECKETT>你注意力集中的时候
<23-1,BECKETT>Oh. The things you notice

141
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,130
<23-1,BECKETT>很有洞察力呢  卡塞尔
<23-1,BECKETT>when you're paying attention, Castle.

142
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,450
<28-1,MAHONEY>是的  我在餐馆做了两年
<28-1,MAHONEY>Yeah, I've been a busboy there for two years.

143
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,850
<28-2,CASTLE>那你8点20的时候在哪
<28-2,CASTLE>So where were you at 8:20?

144
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,810
<28-3,MAHONEY>8点20  我在后面的洗碗池那边刷碗
<28-3,MAHONEY>8:20? Um, I was at a back sink scraping dishes.

145
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,030
<28-4,CASTLE>好吧  那你有没有刚好看到
<28-4,CASTLE>All right. Um, did you happen to see

146
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,760
<24-31,CASTLE>不认识的人出现在厨房里
<24-31,CASTLE>anyone in the kitchen that you didn't recognize?

147
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,830
<24-32,CASTLE>有的  有个人跟我擦身而过
<24-32,CASTLE>Yeah, you know, someone brushed past me.

148
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,900
<24-33,CASTLE>我没有看清楚
<24-33,CASTLE>Uh, I didn't get a good look,

149
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,870
<28-10,MAHONEY>但是我记得他面生
<28-10,MAHONEY>but I remember thinking that he wasn't familiar.

150
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,840
<30-9,CASTLE>你能描述他的样子吗
<30-9,CASTLE>Can you describe him?

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,400
<30-10,BECKETT>不确定  他可能是矮个子  深色头发
<30-10,BECKETT>Not really. He was short, dark hair, maybe.

152
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,600
<30-11,CASTLE>厨房如战场
<30-11,CASTLE>Uh, things move fast in the kitchen,

153
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,950
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>所以我只是眼角瞥到他
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>so I only caught him out of the corner of my eye.

154
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,910
<24-26,CASTLE>讲讲后门的情况  一直是开着的吗
<24-26,CASTLE>Tell me about that back door. Is it always open?

155
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,480
<24-26,CASTLE>应该是关着的
<24-26,CASTLE>I-it shouldn't be.

156
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,610
<24-26,CASTLE>看来受害者  亚瑟·菲尔德
<24-26,CASTLE>So it looks like our victim -- Arthur Felder--

157
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,590
<24-26,CASTLE>不是个很和气的人
<24-26,CASTLE>wasn't the most fuzziest of guys.

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,620
<24-26,CASTLE>他凭恶意收购发了财
<24-26,CASTLE>He made his fortune in hostile takeovers.

159
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,490
<24-26,CASTLE>几周前
<24-26,CASTLE>A couple of weeks ago,

160
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,020
<24-26,CASTLE>他关闭了一家在纽瓦克的化工厂
<24-26,CASTLE>he shut down a chemical plant in Newark

161
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,260
<24-26,CASTLE>分开廉价抛售
<24-26,CASTLE>and sold it off for parts.

162
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,520
<24-26,CASTLE>据说两百人因此丢了工作
<24-26,CASTLE>It says here that 200 people lost their jobs.

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,150
<34-1,ESPOSITO>据他的助手所说
<34-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and according to his assistant,

164
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,710
<34-2,DIEGO>他们宣布倒闭后
<34-2,DIEGO>they got quite a few death threats

165
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,970
<24-14,CASTLE>收到了不少恐吓信
<24-14,CASTLE>after they announced the closing.

166
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,490
<24-15,CASTLE>恶意收购者关闭化工厂
<24-15,CASTLE>Corporate raider shutters a chemical plant

167
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,000
<24-16,CASTLE>最终自食其果  这个案子里  命丧毒鸽
<24-16,CASTLE>and ends up eating crow, or in this case, poisoned squab.

168
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,820
<24-17,CASTLE>挺诗意的  虽然很残忍
<24-17,CASTLE>It's poetic, diabolically speaking.

169
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,790
<24-17,CASTLE>好的  我和卡塞尔会去找蕾妮
<24-17,CASTLE>Okay, Castle and I will talk to Lanie

170
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,810
<24-17,CASTLE>看看毒药和化工厂之间
<24-17,CASTLE>to see if there's any connection

171
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,470
<24-17,CASTLE>有什么联系
<24-17,CASTLE>between the poison and the plant.

172
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,450
<24-17,CASTLE>同时  你们两个
<24-17,CASTLE>In the meantime, why don't you guys

173
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,420
<24-17,CASTLE>去排查一下寄恐吓信的人
<24-17,CASTLE>go through the list of people that made threats

174
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,200
<24-17,CASTLE>看看有没有人当时
<24-17,CASTLE>and see if anyone was in the vicinity

175
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,170
<28-1,MAHONEY>在餐厅附近
<28-1,MAHONEY>of the restaurant?

176
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,030
<28-2,CASTLE>这就去
<28-2,CASTLE>Right on.

177
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,460
<28-3,MAHONEY>抱歉  这跟化工厂制造的任何化工产品
<28-3,MAHONEY>Sorry. It's not a match for any of the chemicals

178
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,060
<28-4,CASTLE>都不匹配
<28-4,CASTLE>manufactured by that plant.

179
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,290
<26-6,BECKETT>那他是被什么毒死的
<26-6,BECKETT>So what was he poisoned with?

180
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,860
<26-7,CASTLE>某种外来药品  以至于普通和
<26-7,CASTLE>Something exotic enough not to show up on a chem

181
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,980
<26-8,RYAN>罕有毒捡都没查出来
<26-8,RYAN>and unknown toxin evaluation.

182
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,130
<26-9,BECKETT>我在做进一步检测  但我只能肯定
<26-9,BECKETT>I'm running further tests, but all I can say for sure

183
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,550
<26-10,ESPOSITO>这是一种麻痹剂
<26-10,ESPOSITO>is that it was some sort of paralyzing agent.

184
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,500
<26-11,CASTLE>说到麻痹剂
<26-11,CASTLE>Speaking of paralyzing agent...

185
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,420
<34-6,RYAN>我能不能说  埃里克·沃恩啊
<34-6,RYAN>Can I just say, Eric Vaughn?!

186
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,360
<34-7,DIEGO>看到没  卡塞尔
<34-7,DIEGO>See, Castle?

187
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,970
<34-8,ESPOSITO>每个人都想跟他吃饭
<34-8,ESPOSITO>Look, he's on everybody's list.

188
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,880
<39-11,BECKETT>好吧  他的确很出色
<39-11,BECKETT>Yes, yes, he's quite impressive.

189
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,610
<26-4,BECKETT>还很帅
<26-4,BECKETT>And handsome.

190
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,760
<26-5,CASTLE>别忘了还多金  那个口音
<26-5,CASTLE>And don't forget rich. And that accent?

191
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,550
<28-3,MAHONEY>-真销魂啊  -我知道
<28-3,MAHONEY>- Ooh, honey. - Oh, I know.

192
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,700
<28-4,CASTLE>行了  行了
<28-4,CASTLE>All right! okay.

193
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,920
<28-4,CASTLE>好吧  我承认
<28-4,CASTLE>I admit, all right,

194
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,190
<28-4,CASTLE>正如那些资质一般的人希望成为我
<28-4,CASTLE>just as lesser men aspire to be me,

195
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,500
<28-4,CASTLE>他就是那些我这种成功人士也向往的人
<28-4,CASTLE>he's who the mes of the world aspire to be, okay?

196
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,400
<28-4,CASTLE>这无法帮我们解决亚瑟·菲尔德的凶案
<28-4,CASTLE>But that is not gonna help us solve Arthur Felder's murder.

197
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,160
<28-4,CASTLE>查出他是被什么毒死的才有用
<28-4,CASTLE>Finding out what he was poisoned with will.

198
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,050
<28-4,CASTLE>我可以告诉你
<28-4,CASTLE>Well, I can tell you this,

199
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,000
<24-1,BECKETT>不管毒剂是什么  都是化学合成的
<24-1,BECKETT>whatever the poison was, was chemically synthesized

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,720
<28-8,BECKETT>起效非常快
<28-8,BECKETT>and incredibly fast-acting.

201
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,210
<28-9,CASTLE>他当时在吃的蘑菇
<28-9,CASTLE>The mushrooms he was eating

202
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,830
<28-10,MAHONEY>甚至还没进入胃部
<28-10,MAHONEY>never even made it to his stomach.

203
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,060
<28-11,CASTLE>谢谢  等等  蘑菇
<28-11,CASTLE>Thank you. Wait. Mushrooms?

204
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,220
<36-1,JIM BECKETT>我看过菜单
<36-1,JIM BECKETT>I saw the menu.

205
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,910
<36-2,BECKETT>蘑菇是跟鹌鹑一起上的  不是乳鸽
<36-2,BECKETT>The mushrooms were served with the quail, not the squab.

206
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:31,950
<36-3,MONTGOMERY>对啊
<36-3,MONTGOMERY>You're right.

207
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,980
<36-4,JIM BECKETT>但莱恩说菲尔德吃了乳鸽
<36-4,JIM BECKETT>But Ryan said that Felder had the squab.

208
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
<31-1,CASTLE>对  这是我的笔迹
<31-1,CASTLE>Yeah, it's my handwriting.

209
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,830
<31-2,BECKETT>就在这张小票上
<31-2,BECKETT>And it's right here on the ticket.

210
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,230
<31-3,CASTLE>菲尔德点的乳鸽
<31-3,CASTLE>Mr. Felder ordered the squab.

211
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,280
<31-4,BECKETT>我们有理由认为
<31-4,BECKETT>Well, we have reason to believe

212
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,960
<31-5,CASTLE>他实际上吃了鹌鹑
<31-5,CASTLE>that he actually ate the quail.

213
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,140
<31-6,BECKETT>下过毒的鹌鹑  卢卡斯
<31-6,BECKETT>The poisoned quail, Lucas.

214
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,560
<31-11,BECKETT>他怎么会吃到的
<31-11,BECKETT>How did he end up with it?

215
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,460
<31-15,CASTLE>天呐  肯定是我弄错了
<31-15,CASTLE>Oh, no. I-I must have made a mistake.

216
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,840
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>我刚开始学记春季菜单
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>I'm still learning the spring menu,

217
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,400
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>鹌鹑炒蘑菇
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>and the quail with the mushrooms

218
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,580
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>看上去很像乳鸽炒洋蓟心
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>looks a lot like the squab with the artichoke hearts.

219
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,870
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>主厨在大叫
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>And chef was screaming.

220
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,390
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>所以你上错了菜
<31-20,CASTLE_BECKETT>So you mixed up the orders.

221
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,110
<27-1,MAHONEY>天呐
<27-1,MAHONEY>Oh, god.

222
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,610
<27-1,MAHONEY>如果菲尔德点了乳鸽
<27-1,MAHONEY>Okay, if Felder ordered the squab,

223
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,020
<25-1,BECKETT>那谁点了鹌鹑
<25-1,BECKETT>then who ordered the quail?

224
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,140
<25-2,CASTLE>这里写着
<25-2,CASTLE>Yeah, here it is.

225
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,660
<23-1,BECKETT>鹌鹑应该是埃里克·沃恩点的
<23-1,BECKETT>The quail was supposed to go to Eric Vaughn.

226
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,110
<23-2,CASTLE>菲尔德并不是预计目标
<23-2,CASTLE>Felder wasn't the intended target.

227
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,830
<23-3,BECKETT>他们想杀的是沃恩
<23-3,BECKETT>They were trying to kill Vaughn.

237
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,880
<24-7,BECKETT>你的意思是  毒是下给我的
<24-7,BECKETT>You mean to say, that poison was meant for me?

238
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,280
<30-4,MARTHA>看来是这样
<30-4,MARTHA>It seems that way.

239
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,760
<30-5,CASTLE>天呐
<30-5,CASTLE>Oh, good god.

240
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,890
<30-5,CASTLE>我该怎么跟亚瑟的妻子交代
<30-5,CASTLE>What am I gonna tell Arthur's wife?

241
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,930
<30-5,CASTLE>沃恩先生
<30-5,CASTLE>Mr. Vaughn--

242
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,500
<30-6,MARTHA>请叫我埃里克
<30-6,MARTHA>Eric, please.

243
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,200
<30-6,MARTHA>埃里克  我理解你的担忧
<30-6,MARTHA>Eric. Um, look, I understand your concern,

244
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,350
<30-6,MARTHA>但现在我们要专注于你了
<30-6,MARTHA>but right now, I think we need to focus on you.

245
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,400
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>你知不知道有谁希望你死
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>Now do you know of anyone that would want you dead?

246
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,370
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>不  但我做到今天的地步必然会树敌
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>No, but you don't get to where I am without making enemies,

247
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,290
<29-15,CASTLE>当我的一项发明成功时
<29-15,CASTLE>when one of my innovations succeeds,

248
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,080
<29-16,BECKETT>往往表示别人失败了
<29-16,BECKETT>it often means that someone else's fails.

249
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,410
<29-17,BECKETT>由于我受人瞩目
<29-17,BECKETT>And being high profile,

250
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,990
<24-23,CASTLE>人们往往想从我身上得到点什么
<24-23,CASTLE>people tend to want things from me

251
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,010
<24-23,CASTLE>或迁怒于我所不能控制的事情
<24-23,CASTLE>or get angry for things that I can't control.

252
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,240
<34-1,ESPOSITO>看来成为埃里克·沃恩代价不小
<34-1,ESPOSITO>Well, it sounds like being Eric Vaughn has its price.

253
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,960
<34-2,DIEGO>别误会  我不是在抱怨
<34-2,DIEGO>Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining.

254
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,640
<34-3,RYAN>我敢肯定你每天面对的事情更棘手
<34-3,RYAN>I'm sure you face much tougher situations every day.

255
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,050
<34-4,ESPOSITO>当有人想杀你的时候
<34-4,ESPOSITO>Well, you know, when someone is trying to kill you,

256
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,960
<34-5,DIEGO>我觉得你完全有权抱怨一下
<34-5,DIEGO>I think that you have every right to complain.

257
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,340
<34-6,RYAN>那最近呢
<34-6,RYAN>So what about recently?

258
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,570
<34-6,RYAN>有没有收到恐吓
<34-6,RYAN>Have you received any threats?

259
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,100
<34-6,RYAN>据我所知没有
<34-6,RYAN>Not that I'm aware of.

260
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,970
<34-6,RYAN>如果我的人觉得事情不严重
<34-6,RYAN>But if my people don't think it's serious,

261
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,830
<34-6,RYAN>他们可能不会来麻烦我
<34-6,RYAN>they often don't bother to tell me.

262
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,850
<34-6,RYAN>我助手佩特拉可以提供文件
<34-6,RYAN>My assistant Petra can get you the file.

263
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,790
<34-6,RYAN>我们需要尽可能多的背景材料
<34-6,RYAN>We'll need as much background as she can give us--

264
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,050
<34-6,RYAN>心怀不满的雇员  愤怒的竞争对手
<34-6,RYAN>disgruntled employees, angry competitors,

265
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,480
<34-6,RYAN>诉讼  之类的材料
<34-6,RYAN>lawsuits, things like that.

266
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,120
<34-6,RYAN>有什么要求尽管提
<34-6,RYAN>Uh, whatever you need.

267
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,210
<34-6,RYAN>探长
<34-6,RYAN>Detective,

268
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,920
<34-6,RYAN>凶手仍然逍遥法外
<34-6,RYAN>whoever did this is still out there.

269
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,970
<23-1,BECKETT>认为他们会再次作案并不夸张
<23-1,BECKETT>It wouldn't be crazy to assume they might try again.

270
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,810
<24-3,BECKETT>是的
<24-3,BECKETT>No. Uh, no, it wouldn't.

271
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,430
<23-4,CASTLE>我可以派些警官来保护你
<23-4,CASTLE>Um, look, I can assign some uniformed officers to you,

272
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,860
<23-5,CASTLE>但我想  直到我们找出凶手
<23-5,CASTLE>but I think, until we figure out who's behind this,

273
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,230
<23-6,CASTLE>你得考虑雇私人保镖
<23-6,CASTLE>you might consider hiring private security.

274
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,680
<23-6,CASTLE>请用
<23-6,CASTLE>And there you go.

275
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,150
<23-6,CASTLE>这是什么
<23-6,CASTLE>What is this?

276
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,300
<23-6,CASTLE>是我不视你为理所当然的表现
<23-6,CASTLE>It's just me not taking you for granted.

277
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,410
<23-6,CASTLE>你和沃恩到底在里面说了什么
<23-6,CASTLE>So what did you talk about there, you and Vaughn?

278
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,130
<26-1,ESPOSITO>我们只是在聊调查的事
<26-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, we were just going over the investigation,

279
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,350
<26-2,BECKETT>讨论接下来的
<26-2,BECKETT>talking out the next few s--

280
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
<26-3,ESPOSITO>等一下
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. Is this--

281
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,010
<26-4,BECKETT>你是不是
<26-4,BECKETT>Are you...

282
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,270
<26-5,CASTLE>你是在嫉妒吗
<26-5,CASTLE>Is this you being jealous?

283
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,630
<26-6,BECKETT>嫉妒
<26-6,BECKETT>Jealous?

284
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,160
<24-21,BECKETT>对
<24-21,BECKETT>Yes.

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,710
<24-22,CASTLE>那家伙赢得了麦克阿瑟天才奖
<24-22,CASTLE>The guy won a Macarthur Genius Award.

286
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,280
<24-23,CASTLE>你知道他们把奖颁给什么人吗
<24-23,CASTLE>Do you know who they give those awards to?

287
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,860
<24-24,CASTLE>天才们
<24-24,CASTLE>Geniuses. Okay?

288
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,830
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>他有一家向非洲运送纯净水的公司
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>He's got one company bringing clean water to Africa

289
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,460
<24-26,CASTLE>还有一家或许能治愈癌症的公司
<24-26,CASTLE>and another one that might actually cure cancer.

290
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,880
<24-27,CASTLE>所以是的  当你单独和他在房间里时
<24-27,CASTLE>So, yes, when you're in a room with him alone,

291
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,350
<24-28,CASTLE>我是有点嫉妒
<24-28,CASTLE>I'm a little jealous.

292
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,080
<30-1,BECKETT>我看到你看他的眼神
<30-1,BECKETT>I saw--I saw how you looked at him.

293
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,550
<30-2,CASTLE>天呐  卡塞尔  那可是埃里克·沃恩
<30-2,CASTLE>Oh, my gosh. Castle. It's Eric Vaughn.

294
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,460
<30-3,BECKETT>他被选为地球上最有趣的
<30-3,BECKETT>He was voted one of the hundred

295
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,300
<29-5,CASTLE>一百个人之一
<29-5,CASTLE>most interesting people on the planet.

296
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,220
<29-6,BECKETT>我当然会有点激动
<29-6,BECKETT>Of course I'm gonna swoon a little,

297
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,200
<29-6,BECKETT>就好像你看到
<29-6,BECKETT>just like you would

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,730
<29-7,CASTLE>芭儿·拉法莉进屋时一样
<29-7,CASTLE>if Bar Refaeli walked through the door.

300
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,010
<29-7,CASTLE>但那毫无意义
<29-7,CASTLE>But it's meaningless.

301
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,050
<29-8,BECKETT>你说得对  只是
<29-8,BECKETT>Yeah, you're right. It's just...

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,040
<30-9,CASTLE>那家伙太吸引人了
<30-9,CASTLE>The guy's so impressive.

303
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,170
<30-10,BECKETT>但他不是你
<30-10,BECKETT>But he's not you.

304
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,060
<30-11,CASTLE>而且  那家伙能得到他想要的任何女人
<30-11,CASTLE>Besides, the guy could get any woman he wants.

305
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,530
<30-12,BECKETT>他对我没兴趣
<30-12,BECKETT>He's not interested in me.

306
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,280
<35-1,CASTLE>可不是嘛
<35-1,CASTLE>Right? I know.

307
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,240
<35-2,MAHONEY>好了
<35-2,MAHONEY>Okay.

308
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,570
<35-3,BECKETT>我和委员谈过
<35-3,BECKETT>I spoke with the commissioner,

309
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,370
<35-4,MAHONEY>他同意为沃恩提供保护
<35-4,MAHONEY>And he's agreed to provide Vaughn with a protective detail.

310
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,910
<35-5,BECKETT>很好  我可以为他推荐
<35-5,BECKETT>Uh, great. I actually have a few uniforms

311
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,080
<35-5,BECKETT>几个警员
<35-5,BECKETT>that I'd like to recommend for duty.

312
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,600
<35-5,BECKETT>不  沃恩先生指定要你
<35-5,BECKETT>No. Mr. Vaughn has requested you.

313
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,150
<29-1,BECKETT>他要干嘛
<29-1,BECKETT>He what now?

314
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,110
<26-9,BECKETT>长官  我是凶杀案探长  不是保镖
<26-9,BECKETT>Sir, I'm a homicide detective, not some bodyguard.

315
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,470
<26-10,ESPOSITO>相信我  我知道
<26-10,ESPOSITO>Trust me, I know.

316
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,930
<26-11,CASTLE>但这是委员直接任命的
<26-11,CASTLE>But this comes directly from the commissioner.

317
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,400
<39-22,CASTLE>为什么沃恩不直接雇一支私人军队呢
<39-22,CASTLE>Why doesn't Vaughn just hire a private army?

318
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,170
<39-22,CASTLE>他承担得起
<39-22,CASTLE>He can afford that.

319
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,960
<39-22,CASTLE>我不知道为什么  卡塞尔先生
<39-22,CASTLE>I don't know why, Mr. Castle.

320
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,650
<35-1,CASTLE>我只知道我的任务是什么
<35-1,CASTLE>I just know what my orders are.

321
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,310
<35-2,MAHONEY>他要贝克特探长  而且只要贝克特
<35-2,MAHONEY>He wants detective Beckett and only Beckett.

322
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,990
<35-5,BECKETT>他能那么干吗
<35-5,BECKETT>Can he even do that?

323
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,700
<35-8,CASTLE>我想他已经那么干了
<35-8,CASTLE>I think he just did.

324
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,280
<35-11,BECKETT>贝克特和沃恩在一起
<35-11,BECKETT>Beckett's hanging with Vaughn?

325
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,440
<35-14,BECKETT>那你当然得担心了
<35-14,BECKETT>Oh, hell, yeah, you should be worried.

326
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,030
<32-14,CASTLE>他在"最性感一百人"榜上有名
<32-14,CASTLE>His hit list includes half of "Maxim's" Hot 100.

327
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,070
<21-2,ESPOSITO>而且跟你不同的是
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Oh, and unlike you,

328
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,760
<21-3,GATES>他的直升机可不用遥控
<21-3,GATES>His helicopter doesn't need a remote control.

329
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,310
<21-4,ESPOSITO>别听他的  卡塞尔  贝克特对你忠贞不二
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Don't listen to him, Castle. Beckett's loyal to you.

330
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,160
<21-5,RYAN>她不会被他的魅力所勾引
<21-5,RYAN>She's not gonna be seduced by his charms.

331
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,180
<21-6,GATES>真的吗  你会让珍妮跟他出门吗
<21-6,GATES>Really? So you'd let Jenny hang with him then?

332
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,130
<21-6,GATES>不可能  我不会让珍妮靠近那家伙
<21-6,GATES>Hell, no. I wouldn't let Jenny near that guy.

333
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,940
<21-6,GATES>多谢
<21-6,GATES>Thanks.

334
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,300
<21-6,GATES>好吧  但是我不担心
<21-6,GATES>Okay, but... I'm not worried.

335
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,790
<21-6,GATES>我不担心好吗  我只是
<21-6,GATES>I'm not. Okay? I just--

336
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,250
<30-1,BECKETT>我不相信局里会违背她的意愿
<30-1,BECKETT>I can't believe that the department

337
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,420
<30-2,CASTLE>让她和一个风流倜傥的有钱人
<30-2,CASTLE>is forcing her to hang out with some womanizing rich guy

338
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,550
<30-3,BECKETT>一起出去
<30-3,BECKETT>against her will.

339
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,660
<30-4,MARTHA>是的  不可思议
<30-4,MARTHA>Yeah. Unbelievable.

340
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,890
<30-5,CASTLE>是啊  这可前所未有
<30-5,CASTLE>Yeah, she's never done that.

341
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,070
<30-6,MARTHA>你们知道我们该怎么办吗
<30-6,MARTHA>You know what we need to do?

342
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,150
<30-6,MARTHA>我们必须尽快解决这个案子
<30-6,MARTHA>We need to solve this case, and fast.

343
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,860
<30-6,MARTHA>好吗  我们越早抓到凶手
<30-6,MARTHA>Okay? The sooner we catch this killer,

344
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,480
<22-1,MAHONEY>就越早让她远离沃恩
<22-1,MAHONEY>The sooner we get her away from Vaughn.

345
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,390
<22-2,CASTLE>在巷子里找到的服务员背心进展如何
<22-2,CASTLE>Where are we on that waiter vest we found in the alley?

346
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,530
<22-2,CASTLE>鉴证组检查了痕迹证据  没有纤维
<22-2,CASTLE>C.S.U. was checking for trace evidence. No fibers.

347
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,050
<22-3,MAHONEY>而且也没能从扣子上提取指纹
<22-3,MAHONEY>And they couldn't pull any prints off the buttons.

348
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,580
<22-4,BECKETT>不行  让他们再做一次
<22-4,BECKETT>No. Have 'em do it again.

349
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,390
<22-8,CASTLE>穿着那件背心的就是凶手
<22-8,CASTLE>Whoever wore that vest is our killer.

350
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,900
<22-12,CASTLE>-我知道  我们以前干过  -是吗
<22-12,CASTLE>- I know. We have done this before. - Have you?

351
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,390
<22-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  淡定
<22-15,BECKETT>Castle! Chill.

352
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,930
<22-19,CASTLE>我们有其他线索
<22-19,CASTLE>We may have another lead.

353
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,350
<31-11,BECKETT>警员在发现那件背心的
<31-11,BECKETT>Uniforms picked up a homeless guy

354
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,370
<31-12,CASTLE>巷子里抓到一个流浪汉
<31-12,CASTLE>in the same alley right where that vest was found.

355
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,250
<22-19,CASTLE>他可能看到了一些东西
<22-19,CASTLE>He may have seen something.

356
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,880
<26-8,RYAN>好吧  那怎么不去审问他
<26-8,RYAN>Well, then why aren't we talking to him?

357
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,540
<26-8,RYAN>因为现在他正醉着呢  看东西都重影
<26-8,RYAN>Because at the moment, he is stupid drunk. Seeing double.

358
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,980
<26-8,RYAN>等他醒了也许能更好地描述事实
<26-8,RYAN>We'll have a better chance of a description once he sobers up.

359
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,270
<26-8,RYAN>-交给我了  -什么叫交给你了
<26-8,RYAN>- I'm on it. - What do you mean, you're on it?

360
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:40,950
<26-8,RYAN>-你去哪  -去给他
<26-8,RYAN>- Where are you going? - To make

<26-8,RYAN>弄一杯他喝过的最提神的咖啡
<26-8,RYAN>him the best damn cup of coffee he's ever had.

362
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,590
<26-8,RYAN>这是个大错误
<26-8,RYAN>This is a big mistake.

363
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,620
<26-8,RYAN>让我保住你性命最好的方式
<26-8,RYAN>The best way for me to keep you alive

364
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,790
<26-8,RYAN>就是出去破案然后抓住那个幕后黑手
<26-8,RYAN>is to get out there and catch the guy that's behind this.

365
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,370
<26-8,RYAN>你低估自己了  探长
<26-8,RYAN>You underestimate yourself, detective.

366

<34-1,ESPOSITO>我确定你能两者兼顾
<34-1,ESPOSITO>I'm quite sure you can do both.

367

<26-3,ESPOSITO>你愿意拿自己的命来赌吗
<26-3,ESPOSITO>And are you willing to bet your life on that?

368
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,020
<30-5,CASTLE>你根本不认识我
<30-5,CASTLE>You don't even know me.

369
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,100
<30-6,MARTHA>我了解得够多
<30-6,MARTHA>I know enough.

374
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,210
<30-11,CASTLE>结案率都要高
<30-11,CASTLE>of anyone in the department.

<30-1,BECKETT>Do you have any idea how remarkable you are?

378
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,070
<30-2,CASTLE>你不知道  对吧
<30-2,CASTLE>You don't, do you?

379
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,500
<30-3,BECKETT>如果有谁能保护我  那就是你
<30-3,BECKETT>If anyone can keep me safe, it's you.

00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,170
<26-1,ESPOSITO>我们喝了几杯  然后...
<26-1,ESPOSITO>We had a few drinks, and--

427
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,400
<26-2,BECKETT>结果弄得很难堪  我懂
<26-2,BECKETT>And it ended badly. I get it.

428
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,290
<26-3,ESPOSITO>事实上  开头就不妙

431
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,690
<26-6,BECKETT>所以我拒绝了她  她很难接受
<26-6,BECKETT>so when I declined, she took it hard.

432
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,830
<32-5,CASTLE>他一直有礼有节
<32-5,CASTLE>He is being polite.

<32-7,BECKETT>And you still work with her?

436
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,260
<32-8,CASTLE>她是个很有才能的研究员
<32-8,CASTLE>She's a very talented researcher.

437
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,130
<32-9,CASTLE>警探  我们都有被内心误导的时候
<32-9,CASTLE>Detective, we're all misled by our hearts sometimes.

438
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,260
<32-10,BECKETT>这不该断送职业生涯
<32-10,BECKETT>It shouldn't end a career.

439
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,110
<32-11,CASTLE>也不该葬送生命
<32-11,CASTLE>It shouldn't end a life, either.

440
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,110
<35-1,CASTLE>辛迪住在哪里
<35-1,CASTLE>So where does Cindy live?

441
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,440
<35-2,MAHONEY>在曼哈顿下城区的高校实验室附近
<35-2,MAHONEY>By the university labs in lower Manhattan.

442
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,870
<35-3,BECKETT>住在市里  餐馆附近
<35-3,BECKETT>So in the city... near the restaurant.

443
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,940
<35-4,MAHONEY>还能拿到蛤蚌毒素
<35-4,MAHONEY>And with access to saxitoxin.

444
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,720
<35-5,BECKETT>我有麻省理工的化学博士学位
<35-5,BECKETT>I have a PhD in chemistry from M.I.T.

445
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,760
<35-6,MAHONEY>当然听说过蛤蚌毒素
<35-6,MAHONEY>Of course I've heard of saxitoxin.

446
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,790
<31-3,CASTLE>相当危险的东西  辛迪
<31-3,CASTLE>Pretty dangerous stuff, Cindy.

447
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,160
<31-4,BECKETT>你工作中用到过吗
<31-4,BECKETT>You ever work with any of it?

448
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,130
<31-5,CASTLE>用到过  很多其它实验室也用过
<31-5,CASTLE>We do, as do a lot of other labs.

449
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,100
<31-6,BECKETT>帕拉蒂女士  我们知道你和埃里克·沃恩
<31-6,BECKETT>Ms. Paralti, we understand that you and Eric Vaughn

450
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,250
<31-7,CASTLE>私下翻脸了
<31-7,CASTLE>had a personal falling out.

451
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,190
<31-8,BECKETT>是啊  怎么了
<31-8,BECKETT>Yeah. So?

452
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,710
<31-9,CASTLE>有不开心吗
<31-9,CASTLE>So any hard feelings?

453
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,270
<31-10,CASTLE>很痛苦  不过我想开了
<31-10,CASTLE>It was painful, but I got over it.

454
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,820
<31-11,BECKETT>是吗  那可不是你的作风
<31-11,BECKETT>Did you? Because that hasn't been your pattern.

455
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,840
<31-11,BECKETT>你的三位前男友都对你申请了限制令
<31-11,BECKETT>You've had restraining orders filed against you by three ex-boyfriends.

456
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,030
<31-11,BECKETT>你刮花了他们的车  划破了轮胎
<31-11,BECKETT>You've keyed cars, slashed tires.

457
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,880
<31-11,BECKETT>活脱脱演绎了凯莉·安德伍德的歌
<31-11,BECKETT>Straight out of a Carrie Underwood song.

459
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,950
<31-11,BECKETT>对  可你知道吗
<31-11,BECKETT>Yeah, but you know what

460
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,690
<31-11,BECKETT>-凯莉·安德伍德没唱过什么吗  -什么
<31-11,BECKETT>- Carrie Underwood never sang about? - What's that?

461
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,890
<33-1,CASTLE>用强效神经毒素
<33-1,CASTLE>Using a chemically enhanced neurotoxin

462
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,370
<33-2,CASTLE>在餐馆毒死人
<33-2,CASTLE>to poison a guy in a restaurant.

463
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,120
<30-2,CASTLE>你看  埃里克·沃恩逃过一劫
<30-2,CASTLE>See, Eric Vaughn, he survived.

464
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,360
<30-3,BECKETT>可有个人却没那么幸运
<30-3,BECKETT>But one of the other people he was with wasn't so lucky.

465
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,700
<41-12,BECKETT>有人想杀埃里克
<41-12,BECKETT>Someone tried to kill Eric?

466
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,500
<41-13,GATES>不  我绝不会杀他
<41-13,GATES>No. I would never.

467
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,440
<41-14,BECKETT>帕拉蒂女士
<41-14,BECKETT>Ms. Paralti,

468
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,140
<31-3,CASTLE>你能接触到毒素
<31-3,CASTLE>you had access to the toxin.

469
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,580
<31-4,BECKETT>你昨晚在哪里  辛迪
<31-4,BECKETT>Where were you last night, Cindy?

470
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,980
<31-5,CASTLE>在歌剧院  看《蝴蝶夫人》
<31-5,CASTLE>At the opera. "Madame butterfly."

471
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,570
<31-6,BECKETT>你们可以去查
<31-6,BECKETT>You can check.

472
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,570
<31-7,CASTLE>我有发现
<31-7,CASTLE>I got something.

473
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,370
<31-8,BECKETT>好了  喝了两杯咖啡  一杯拿铁
<31-8,BECKETT>Okay, so after two cups of coffee, a latte,

474
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,650
<31-8,BECKETT>三杯浓缩咖啡后  我们这位流浪汉朋友
<31-8,BECKETT>and three espressos, our homeless friend--

475
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,540
<40-1,RYAN>坐在那边的黑泽顿先生  终于清醒了
<40-1,RYAN>Mr. Hazelton over there-- finally sobered up.

476
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,740
<40-2,CASTLE>他说看到是谁往垃圾桶里扔的背心了
<40-2,CASTLE>He said he saw who stashed the vest in the dumpster.

477
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,580
<40-3,RYAN>他说那家伙穿着餐馆工作服
<40-3,RYAN>He said the fellow was dressed in a busboy uniform.

478
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,530
<40-4,ESPOSITO>等等
<40-4,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute.

479
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,000
<40-5,CASTLE>你说说不是外人干的
<40-5,CASTLE>Are you saying it wasn't someone from the outside?

480
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
<40-6,ESPOSITO>是伊爱阁的工作人员干的
<40-6,ESPOSITO>It was someone who worked at Iago?

481
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,790
<33-2,CASTLE>对  于是我给他看了几张伊爱阁雇员的照片
<33-2,CASTLE>Right. So I showed him photos of all the Iago employees,

482
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,040
<33-3,BECKETT>他指认出这个人
<33-3,BECKETT>And he fingered this guy.

483
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,150
<33-4,CASTLE>科瑞·哈里森
<33-4,CASTLE>Cory Harrison.

484
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,610
<33-5,BECKETT>等等  我和这人说过话
<33-5,BECKETT>Wait a second. I spoke with this guy.

485
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,850
<33-6,CASTLE>他试图归咎于另一个人
<33-6,CASTLE>He tried to pin it on somebody else.

486
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,290
<35-12,CASTLE>那他就是在撒谎  试图制造出
<35-12,CASTLE>Well, then he's lying, trying to make it look like

487
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,760
<35-13,BECKETT>是外人干的假象  贼喊捉贼
<35-13,BECKETT>it was someone from the outside when it was him all along.

488
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,060
<35-14,BECKETT>-他为什么要毒害沃恩  -一问便知
<35-14,BECKETT>- Why would he want to poison Vaughn? - Let's ask him.

489
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,330
<35-15,BECKETT>-要咖啡吗  -不要
<35-15,BECKETT>- Coffee? - No.

490
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,870
<35-16,CASTLE>我或许也该停了
<35-16,CASTLE>I should probably stop, too.

491
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,950
<39-3,BECKETT>再来一杯
<39-3,BECKETT>One more.

494
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,260
<39-4,CASTLE>纽约警察
<39-4,CASTLE>NYPD!

495
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,690
<39-5,BECKETT>警察
<39-5,BECKETT>Police!

496
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,140
<39-6,CASTLE>来这边
<39-6,CASTLE>Over here.

497
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,370
<39-6,CASTLE>看来有人先到了一步
<39-6,CASTLE>Looks like someone got here first.

498
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,070
<39-6,CASTLE>鹅绒过敏吗
<39-6,CASTLE>Ooh. Goose down allergy?

499
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,450
<39-5,BECKETT>我没事的  科瑞·哈里森就不行了
<39-5,BECKETT>I'll live, unlike Cory Harrison.

500
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,750
<39-5,BECKETT>凶手显然用枕头充当了静音器
<39-5,BECKETT>Killer clearly used a pillow as a poor-man's silencer.

501
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,630
<39-5,BECKETT>也没有强行入室的迹象
<39-5,BECKETT>No sign of forced entry, either.

502
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,200
<32-17,CASTLE>或许他认识凶手
<32-17,CASTLE>Maybe he knew his killer.

503
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,030
<24-5,BECKETT>而且他有心理准备了
<24-5,BECKETT>He also knew what was coming.

504
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,260
<24-6,CASTLE>哈里森先生的手腕上有防卫伤
<24-6,CASTLE>I found defensive wounds on Mr. Harrison's wrists.

505
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,910
<31-12,CASTLE>不过我找不到别的了
<31-12,CASTLE>But that's all I'm gonna find.

506
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,130
<31-13,CASTLE>有人用漂白剂清洗了他的双手
<31-13,CASTLE>Someone washed his hands with bleach.

507
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,250
<31-14,BECKETT>处理掉DNA和痕量证据
<31-14,BECKETT>Disposing of D.N.A. and trace evidence?

508
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,810
<31-15,CASTLE>看来凶手是个职业杀手
<31-15,CASTLE>Shooter sounds like a pro.

509
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,120
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>对  我想我知道他来这里的原因
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>Yep, and I think I know why he was here.

510
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,720
<24-15,CASTLE>实验室证实了
<24-15,CASTLE>The lab confirms it.

511
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,840
<24-16,CASTLE>科瑞·哈里森公寓里的瓶子
<24-16,CASTLE>The bottle in Cory Harrison's apartment

512
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,930
<24-17,CASTLE>含有杀死菲尔德的毒素
<24-17,CASTLE>contains the toxin that killed Felder.

513
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,420
<24-18,CASTLE>所以是有人借刀杀人
<24-18,CASTLE>So someone was using him to spike Vaughn's food,

514
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,160
<24-19,CASTLE>然后过河拆桥
<24-19,CASTLE>and then got rid of him.

515
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,610
<24-19,CASTLE>所以哈里森的生活中
<24-19,CASTLE>Which means somewhere in Harrison's life--

516
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,180
<24-19,CASTLE>家庭  财务  或工作中
<24-19,CASTLE>His family, financials, or work--

517
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,950
<24-19,CASTLE>有找到幕后主使的关键
<24-19,CASTLE>There's the key to whoever's behind all of this.

518
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,030
<24-19,CASTLE>或许餐馆有人知道他的事
<24-19,CASTLE>Maybe someone at the restaurant knew what he was up to.

519
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:44,940
<18-1,GATES>我们该回去问问
<18-1,GATES>We should go back there. Mm-hmm.

520
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,410
<18-2,RYAN>不  你和其他警探可以回去调查  卡塞尔先生
<18-2,RYAN>No, you and the boys can go back there, Mr. Castle.

521
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,220
<29-12,DICK COONAN>贝克特得去法维克酒店
<29-12,DICK COONAN>Beckett's going to the Fairwyck Hotel.

522
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,220
<40-5,CASTLE>法维克里有什么
<40-5,CASTLE>What's at the Fairwyck?

523
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,630
<40-6,ESPOSITO>埃里克·沃恩
<40-6,ESPOSITO>Eric Vaughn.

524
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,730
<35-1,CASTLE>只要凶手还没落网
<35-1,CASTLE>As long as we have a killer running around,

525
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,010
<35-2,MAHONEY>就得保证他待在安全的地方
<35-2,MAHONEY>I need him somewhere safe.

526
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,040
<35-3,BECKETT>他定了总统套房
<35-3,BECKETT>So, he booked the presidential suite,

527
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,360
<35-4,MAHONEY>从现在起  直到我们找到幕后真凶
<35-4,MAHONEY>and from now until the time we catch whoever's behind all this,

528
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,530
<30-8,BECKETT>你都得和他待在一起
<30-8,BECKETT>you're staying there with him.

529
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,930
<30-9,CASTLE>在总统套房
<30-9,CASTLE>In the presidential suite?

530
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,740
<30-10,BECKETT>长官  你没开玩笑吧
<30-10,BECKETT>Uh, sir, are you s-serious?

531
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,210
<30-10,BECKETT>你想让我照看他
<30-10,BECKETT>You want me to babysit this guy?

532
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,250
<30-10,BECKETT>他坚持这样
<30-10,BECKETT>He's insisting.

533
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,580
<30-10,BECKETT>显然  你让他赞不绝口
<30-10,BECKETT>Apparently, you made quite an impression.

534
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,190
<30-10,BECKETT>长官  我...
<30-10,BECKETT>Uh, sir, I--

535
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,200
<30-10,BECKETT>警探  我知道你有所顾虑
<30-10,BECKETT>Detective, I know how you feel,

536
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,170
<19-1,BOYER>可杀了那个餐馆工的人是个职业杀手
<19-1,BOYER>but whoever killed that busboy was a pro,

537
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,710
<25-2,CASTLE>所以他可能卷土重来
<25-2,CASTLE>which means he may strike again,

538
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,910
<25-3,BECKETT>我不能让世上最有影响力的人之一
<25-3,BECKETT>and I am not going to lose one of the world's most influential men

539
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,290
<25-3,BECKETT>在我眼皮底下遇害
<25-3,BECKETT>on my watch.

540
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,870
<25-3,BECKETT>保驾护航是一回事
<25-3,BECKETT>You know, it's one thing to follow him around,

541
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,910
<25-3,BECKETT>和他同居又是一回事
<25-3,BECKETT>but quite another to be shacking up with him.

542
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,300
<24-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不是要和他同居
<24-1,BECKETT>Castle, I am not shacking up with him.

543
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
<24-2,CASTLE>我只是在尽我的职责
<24-2,CASTLE>I'm just doing my job.

544
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,340
<24-3,BECKETT>是啊
<24-3,BECKETT>Right.

545
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,130
<24-4,CASTLE>你不相信我
<24-4,CASTLE>You don't trust me.

546
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,300
<29-10,BECKETT>我当然相信你
<29-10,BECKETT>Oh, no. Of course I trust you.

547
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,950
<29-11,CASTLE>你才不信  所以你才这个样子
<29-11,CASTLE>No, you don't. That's what this is all about.

548
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,390
<29-12,DICK COONAN>不然的话  我们根本不用讨论这件事
<29-12,DICK COONAN>Otherwise, this wouldn't be an issue.

549
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,290
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>可以走了吗
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>Shall we?

550
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,930
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>当然
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>Yes.

551
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,340
<29-15,CASTLE>这种时候还有心情喝咖啡
<29-15,CASTLE>A coffee break at a time like this?

552
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,150
<30-4,MARTHA>没搞错吧
<30-4,MARTHA>Really, guys?

553
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,480
<30-5,CASTLE>你怎么了  兄弟
<30-5,CASTLE>What's your problem, bro?

554
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,530
<30-6,MARTHA>你快给珍妮打电话
<30-6,MARTHA>Look, you need to call Jenny,

555
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,910
<25-2,CASTLE>你该打给谁就打给谁
<25-2,CASTLE>and you need to call whoever it is you call,

556
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,220
<25-3,BECKETT>因为只要案子没破  我们就都不会回家
<25-3,BECKETT>because we are not going home until we solve this murder.

557
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:17,950
<28-4,CASTLE>听到了吗
<28-4,CASTLE>All right?

558
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,060
<34-3,RYAN>现在咱们去餐厅找找答案
<34-3,RYAN>Let's get to that restaurant and get some answers.

559
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,140
<34-4,ESPOSITO>我没有开玩笑
<34-4,ESPOSITO>Seriously, guys. I mean it.

560
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,300
<34-5,DIEGO>这是我见过最棒的安全屋了
<34-5,DIEGO>This is the nicest safe house I've ever seen.

561
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,990
<29-7,CASTLE>既然有人想要你的命
<29-7,CASTLE>Well, if someone's trying to kill you,

562
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,520
<29-8,BECKETT>不如把担惊受怕的生活过得舒坦点
<29-8,BECKETT>you might as well make the most of it, eh?

563
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,050
<29-8,BECKETT>我该开始工作了
<29-8,BECKETT>I should get to work.

564
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,520
<29-8,BECKETT>帮我给诺瓦公司道歉
<29-8,BECKETT>Apologies to Novatech,

565
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,290
<29-8,BECKETT>去墨日能源的行程也推到夏天吧
<29-8,BECKETT>and let's cancel the Mexisolar trip until summer.

566
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,320
<29-8,BECKETT>谢了  佩特拉
<29-8,BECKETT>Thanks, Petra.

567
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,430
<29-8,BECKETT>你最后一次联络杰夫·萨斯曼是什么时候
<29-8,BECKETT>When were you last in contact with Jeff Sussman?

568
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,720
<29-8,BECKETT>不是萨斯曼干的
<29-8,BECKETT>It's not Sussman.

569
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,560
<29-8,BECKETT>但是你开除了他
<29-8,BECKETT>But you fired him,

570
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,460
<21-1,GATES>他还挪用公款
<21-1,GATES>and he was convicted of embezzling.

571
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,140
<21-2,ESPOSITO>对我来说这就是犯罪动机
<21-2,ESPOSITO>That sounds like a suspect to me.

572
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,200
<21-3,GATES>他办砸了事  不过也付出了代价
<21-3,GATES>Look, the guy screwed up and paid for it.

573
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
<21-4,ESPOSITO>但我把他妈妈安排进养老院
<21-4,ESPOSITO>But I set his mother up in an assisted-living facility.

574
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,910
<21-5,RYAN>杰夫很感激
<21-5,RYAN>Jeff was very grateful.

575
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:22,940
<21-6,GATES>不是他
<21-6,GATES>It's not him.

576
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,150
<30-10,BECKETT>你约了人吗
<30-10,BECKETT>Are you expecting anyone?

577
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,220
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>我冒昧地叫了客房服务
<24-25,JONATHAN TISDALE>I took the liberty of ordering some room service.

578
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,940
<24-26,CASTLE>晚上好  女士  我可以进去吗
<24-26,CASTLE>Good evening, ma'am. May I come in?

579
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,800
<24-27,CASTLE>抱歉  不行
<24-27,CASTLE>Uh, actually, no. Sorry.

580
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
<24-27,CASTLE>考虑到菲尔德被杀害的方式
<24-27,CASTLE>Listen, given the way that Felder was killed,

581
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,180
<24-27,CASTLE>我想让我们的人监督食物的准备过程
<24-27,CASTLE>I would prefer if my people oversaw the food preparation.

582
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,000
<25-1,BECKETT>我可不可以拿香槟进来
<25-1,BECKETT>May I at least grab the champagne?

583
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,360
<25-2,CASTLE>它是密封的
<25-2,CASTLE>It is sealed.

584
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,230
<39-4,CASTLE>好  你拿吧
<39-4,CASTLE>Yeah. Okay, fine.

585
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,660
<39-5,BECKETT>不好意思
<39-5,BECKETT>Excuse me.

586
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,420
<39-6,CASTLE>给
<39-6,CASTLE>Here.

587
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,930
<28-11,CASTLE>谢谢  先生
<28-11,CASTLE>Thank you, sir.

588
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,660
<28-11,CASTLE>我会安排人送吃的
<28-11,CASTLE>I'll make sure that we get you some food up here.

589
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,920
<28-11,CASTLE>没关系  最重要的我们已经有了
<28-11,CASTLE>That's okay. We have the essentials.

590
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,020
<28-11,CASTLE>帮你倒一杯
<28-11,CASTLE>Pour you a glass?

591
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,040
<28-11,CASTLE>不  谢了  我在执勤
<28-11,CASTLE>Oh, no, thank you. I'm on duty.

592
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,310
<22-15,BECKETT>你对工作很认真
<22-15,BECKETT>You take your work seriously.

593
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,220
<22-16,CASTLE>我喜欢你这一点
<22-16,CASTLE>I like that about you.

594
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,550
<22-17,CASTLE>让我觉得很安全
<22-17,CASTLE>It makes me feel safe.

595
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,440
<22-18,BECKETT>我的天啊
<22-18,BECKETT>oh, my God!

596
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,970
<22-19,CASTLE>你还好吗
<22-19,CASTLE>Are you okay?

597
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,410
<22-20,BECKETT>没事  我觉得你得防着我害死自己了
<22-20,BECKETT>Yes. I think you're gonna have to protect me from myself.

598
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,710
<22-21,LANIE>我去帮你拿点冰块
<22-21,LANIE>Okay. Um, I'm gonna go and get you some ice, okay?

599
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,930
<22-22,BECKETT>你知道吗  我很高兴科瑞死了
<22-22,BECKETT>You know what? I'm glad Cory's dead.

600
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,520
<22-23,LANIE>那件事之后
<22-23,LANIE>After what happened,

601
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,420
<22-24,BECKETT>该死的卫生部就不让我们营业了
<22-24,BECKETT>the bloody health department shut me down.

602
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,650
<31-3,CASTLE>如果我知道他干了什么  我也会亲手杀了他
<31-3,CASTLE>I mean, if I'd known what he did, I'd have killed him myself.

603
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,560
<40-7,CASTLE>不过我们认为
<40-7,CASTLE>Yeah, except we think

604
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,320
<40-8,ESPOSITO>让他在你餐厅里投毒的人
<40-8,ESPOSITO>whoever put him up to poisoning your food

605
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,490
<40-9,CASTLE>就是杀了他的那个人
<40-9,CASTLE>was the one who killed him.

606
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,590
<40-10,BECKETT>你想报仇吗  帮我们找到凶手
<40-10,BECKETT>You want revenge? Help us find his killer.

607
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,100
<31-10,CASTLE>你想知道什么
<31-10,CASTLE>What do you want to know?

608
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,900
<31-11,BECKETT>投毒那天你有没有发现科瑞
<31-11,BECKETT>Did you notice anything unusual about Cory

609
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,780
<40-7,CASTLE>有反常的举动
<40-7,CASTLE>the day of the poisoning?

610
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,640
<40-8,ESPOSITO>那个混蛋迟到了
<40-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah. The son of a bitch was late.

611
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,700
<24-27,CASTLE>抱歉  这就算反常了
<24-27,CASTLE>I'm sorry. That's it?

612
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,160
<35-1,CASTLE>你不明白  从来没人迟到
<35-1,CASTLE>You don't understand. No one's late, ever.

613
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,690
<24-18,CASTLE>这是我的规矩
<24-18,CASTLE>It's one of my rules.

614
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,280
<21-3,GATES>我就应该当场开除他
<21-3,GATES>I mean, I should've fired him on the spot.

615
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,290
<21-4,ESPOSITO>为什么没有呢
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Why didn't you?

616
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,250
<21-5,RYAN>因为他的眼神
<21-5,RYAN>The look in his eyes.

617
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,520
<21-6,GATES>就像见了鬼一样
<21-6,GATES>It was like he'd seen a ghost.

618
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,850
<21-7,RYAN>那天他绝对出了什么事
<21-7,RYAN>Something happened to him that day.

619
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,540
<21-8,ESPOSITO>坏事
<21-8,ESPOSITO>Something bad.

620
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:17,060
<21-9,GATES>来
<21-9,GATES>Here.

621
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,630
<21-10,RYAN>可以消肿
<21-10,RYAN>That should help with the swelling.

622
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,560
<22-23,LANIE>是啊  但伤了的自尊是回不来了
<22-23,LANIE>Yes, but, uh, not my pride.

623
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,110
<22-24,BECKETT>你有这样的"手法"
<22-24,BECKETT>You know, with your bedside manner,

624
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,310
<22-25,NATALIE RHODES>你真该去当医生
<22-25,NATALIE RHODES>you could've been a doctor.

625
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,770
<22-26,MADISON>我吗  不行
<22-26,MADISON>Me? No, no.

626
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,620
<24-19,CASTLE>律师有可能  我读过法学预科
<24-19,CASTLE>A lawyer, maybe. I was, uh, in pre-law.

627
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
<24-20,CASTLE>在你状告酒塞的案子上
<24-20,CASTLE>I could've represented you

628
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,320
<24-21,BECKETT>我本可以当你的辩护律师
<24-21,BECKETT>in your case against the cork.

629
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,880
<24-22,CASTLE>但是你却当了警察
<24-22,CASTLE>But instead, you became a cop.

630
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,380
<24-22,CASTLE>为什么
<24-22,CASTLE>Why?

631
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,440
<24-22,CASTLE>一个跟我很亲近的人被杀害了
<24-22,CASTLE>Uh, someone close to me was killed,

632
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,780
<24-22,CASTLE>这...
<24-22,CASTLE>and that just...

633
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,380
<24-22,CASTLE>改变了一些事  也改变了我
<24-22,CASTLE>changed things and changed me.

634
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,040
<24-22,CASTLE>我本来想当个建筑师的
<24-22,CASTLE>You know, I was supposed to be an architect.

635
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,710
<26-1,ESPOSITO>没开玩笑
<26-1,ESPOSITO>No, seriously.

636
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,870
<26-5,CASTLE>但在我上大学的时候我姐姐去世了
<26-5,CASTLE>But my sister died when I was in college--

637
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,460
<26-6,BECKETT>先天性心脏病
<26-6,BECKETT>heart defect.

638
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,390
<13-25,CASTLE>所以我辍学
<13-25,CASTLE>So I dropped out

639
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,770
<13-25,CASTLE>发明了一种新的人工心瓣
<13-25,CASTLE>and invented a new heart valve.

640
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,010
<13-25,CASTLE>那是我第一项专利
<13-25,CASTLE>That was my first patent.

641
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,620
<18-1,GATES>这样被命运改变了生活可真神奇  对吗
<18-1,GATES>It's amazing how fate changes lives, isn't it?

642
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,440
<18-2,RYAN>我要回去工作了
<18-2,RYAN>I should get back to work.

643
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,600
<18-2,RYAN>至少喝一杯吧
<18-2,RYAN>At least have a glass of champagne.

644
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,990
<18-2,RYAN>毕竟我可为它受了苦头
<18-2,RYAN>I mean, I have suffered for it, after all.

645
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,010
<18-2,RYAN>好吧
<18-2,RYAN>Okay, fine.

646
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,790
<18-2,RYAN>既然你这么说了
<18-2,RYAN>You know what? You put it that way...

647
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,280
<18-2,RYAN>就半杯吧  行吗
<18-2,RYAN>but just half a glass, okay?

648
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,070
<18-2,RYAN>再多一点  大半杯
<18-2,RYAN>Go on. Three-quarters.

649
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,650
<18-2,RYAN>好吧
<18-2,RYAN>Yeah.

650
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,270
<26-1,ESPOSITO>我们找过科瑞·哈里森的女朋友
<26-1,ESPOSITO>We talked to Cory Harrison's girlfriend.

651
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,700
<26-2,BECKETT>据她说  昨天早上他离开她家时
<26-2,BECKETT>According to her, he was in a good mood

652
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,300
<26-2,BECKETT>心情很不错
<26-2,BECKETT>when he left her apartment yesterday morning.

653
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,510
<26-2,BECKETT>那肯定是在去餐厅的路上
<26-2,BECKETT>Then something must have happened

654
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,120
<26-2,BECKETT>发生了一些事
<26-2,BECKETT>between home and the restaurant.

655
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,530
<26-2,BECKETT>事实上  的确是这样
<26-2,BECKETT>In fact, something did.

656
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,850
<28-1,MAHONEY>我们查了科瑞的行程
<28-1,MAHONEY>We took a look at Cory's routine.

657
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,550
<28-2,CASTLE>基本每天早上他离开家之后
<28-2,CASTLE>Pretty much every morning, he left his apartment,

658
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,150
<28-2,CASTLE>送他女儿去幼儿园
<28-2,CASTLE>picked up his daughter, took her to preschool.

659
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,870
<28-2,CASTLE>步行去公交车站
<28-2,CASTLE>Then he'd walk to the bus stop,

660
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,150
<34-1,ESPOSITO>坐10-x公交车
<34-1,ESPOSITO>where he'd catch the 10-x

661
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,020
<34-2,DIEGO>从斯塔顿岛去市里
<34-2,DIEGO>from Staten Island into the city.

662
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,480
<34-3,RYAN>太好了  警监  你来了  告诉她了吗
<34-3,RYAN>Ah. Great, captain, you're here. Did you tell her?

663
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,350
<34-4,ESPOSITO>告诉了
<34-4,ESPOSITO>I did tell her.

664
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,550
<34-5,DIEGO>这是昨天公交车站的
<34-5,DIEGO>Okay, this is the security video footage

665
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,290
<26-11,CASTLE>安保监控录像
<26-11,CASTLE>from the bus shelter yesterday.

666
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,420
<28-9,CASTLE>给她看看
<28-9,CASTLE>Show her the...

667
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,630
<28-10,MAHONEY>给她看看
<28-10,MAHONEY>Show her the...

668
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,830
<28-11,CASTLE>谢谢
<28-11,CASTLE>Thank you.

669
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,200
<30-2,CASTLE>科瑞  就是那个服务员在和别人说话
<30-2,CASTLE>There's our busboy Cory talking to some guy.

670
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
<30-3,BECKETT>这辆车是10-x公交车
<30-3,BECKETT>And that is the 10-x bus,

671
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,560
<30-4,MARTHA>但是科瑞却没上去
<30-4,MARTHA>but Cory does not get on.

672
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,270
<30-5,CASTLE>他都要迟到了
<30-5,CASTLE>He is late for work.

673
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,350
<30-6,MARTHA>却顶着被开除的风险继续和那个男的说话
<30-6,MARTHA>He risks getting fired just to talk to this guy.

674
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,520
<30-6,MARTHA>对这个人  我们有什么了解
<30-6,MARTHA>Well, what do we know about him?

675
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,270
<30-6,MARTHA>一无所知  看不清他的脸
<30-6,MARTHA>Nothing. We can't get a good look at him.

676
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,600
<30-6,MARTHA>他好像知道摄像头在哪里
<30-6,MARTHA>It's like he knows where the camera is.

677
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,470
<30-6,MARTHA>对  不过从这里就开始有趣了
<30-6,MARTHA>Right, but this is where it gets interesting.

678
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,850
<30-6,MARTHA>-我该怎么  -那个键
<30-6,MARTHA>- How do I... - That one.

679
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,520
<30-6,MARTHA>按这个吗
<30-6,MARTHA>That one?

680
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,380
<30-6,MARTHA>慢着  那就是毒药
<30-6,MARTHA>Wait. That's the bottle of poison.

681
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,960
<30-6,MARTHA>没错  而且在他下毒之后
<30-6,MARTHA>Right, and after he used it to poison the food,

682
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,100
<30-6,MARTHA>我认为是这家伙开枪打死了他
<30-6,MARTHA>I'm betting this guy came back and shot him

683
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,350
<28-1,MAHONEY>以绝后患
<28-1,MAHONEY>to tie up loose ends.

684
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,900
<28-2,CASTLE>这人就是凶手
<28-2,CASTLE>He's your killer.

685
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,070
<28-3,MAHONEY>我也希望能帮上忙
<28-3,MAHONEY>Look, I wish I could help you,

686
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,840
<28-4,CASTLE>可是我真不认得这人
<28-4,CASTLE>but, uh, I simply just don't know him.

687
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,670
<28-5,MAHONEY>莱恩  我们得把录像再研究一遍
<28-5,MAHONEY>Ryan, we gotta go over that video again.

688
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,680
<28-6,CASTLE>肯定会有线索能让我们查出
<28-6,CASTLE>There's gotta be something in it that'll help us figure out

689
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,570
<31-22,CASTLE_BECKETT>这人是谁
<31-22,CASTLE_BECKETT>who he is.

690
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,530
<31-22,CASTLE_BECKETT>失陪一下
<31-22,CASTLE_BECKETT>Uh, excuse me.

691
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,720
<31-23,RYAN>看来你俩挺享受啊
<31-23,RYAN>Looks as though you two were enjoying yourselves.

692
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,380
<40-25,RYAN>卡塞尔
<40-25,RYAN>Castle--

693
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,150
<40-26,CASTLE>穿什么睡衣呢
<40-26,CASTLE>What about pajamas--

694
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,270
<40-27,RYAN>家居服还是性感睡衣
<40-27,RYAN>Homely flannel or skimpy sleep shorts?

695
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,670
<30-5,CASTLE>天呐  你说话跟我爸送我去夏令营时
<30-5,CASTLE>Oh, my gosh. You're sounding like my dad

696
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,510
<40-32,CASTLE>一模一样
<40-32,CASTLE>dropping me off at summer camp.

697
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,390
<30-11,CASTLE>夏令营有香槟喝吗
<30-11,CASTLE>Did they serve champagne at your summer camp?

698
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,000
<30-12,BECKETT>人家盛情难却
<30-12,BECKETT>I was being polite.

699
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,440
<30-13,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你以为我喜欢这样吗
<30-13,CASTLE>Castle, do you think I want this?

700
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,150
<30-14,MARTHA>你以为是我要求来这来的吗
<30-14,MARTHA>Do you think I asked to be here?

701
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,380
<30-15,CASTLE>我觉得你挺享受的
<30-15,CASTLE>I think you're making the best of it.

702
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,110
<30-15,CASTLE>你知道我情愿和你一起
<30-15,CASTLE>You know I would rather be with you.

703
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,950
<30-15,CASTLE>那要不我留下吧
<30-15,CASTLE>Well, then maybe I should stay

704
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,920
<30-15,CASTLE>咱俩一起保护他
<30-15,CASTLE>and we can protect him together.

705
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,290
<30-15,CASTLE>不行  我不准
<30-15,CASTLE>No, I am not letting you do this.

706
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,880
<30-15,CASTLE>我不会让你把调查案子
<30-15,CASTLE>I'm not letting you turn this investigation

707
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,700
<30-15,CASTLE>变成一场扭曲的爷们比拼
<30-15,CASTLE>into some kind of a twisted competition.

708
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,950
<30-15,CASTLE>听话
<30-15,CASTLE>Look...

709
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,540
<30-15,CASTLE>别添乱子了
<30-15,CASTLE>Don't make this harder than it needs to be.

710
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,010
<30-15,CASTLE>-求你了  -好吧
<30-15,CASTLE>- Please. - Okay.

711
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,690
<30-15,CASTLE>既然你都求我了
<30-15,CASTLE>But only because you said please.

712
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,040
<30-15,CASTLE>既然我们没法看清他的脸
<30-15,CASTLE>Since we can't get a clean look at this guy's face,

713
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,960
<30-15,CASTLE>我希望有别的办法
<30-15,CASTLE>I'm hoping there's some other way

714
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,060
<28-1,MAHONEY>能查明他的身份
<28-1,MAHONEY>we might be able to I.D. Him.

715
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,540
<28-2,CASTLE>幸运的是  除了脸
<28-2,CASTLE>Fortunately, we're all much more

716
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,280
<10-3,CASTLE>我们还有很多特征
<10-3,CASTLE>than our faces, detective.

717
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,970
<10-4,BECKETT>哈里森的驾照上说他身高1米76
<10-4,BECKETT>Harrison's driver's license lists him at 5'10".

718
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,410
<10-5,CASTLE>另一人看起来身高1米85
<10-5,CASTLE>That other guy looks like he's 6'2".

719
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,570
<10-6,CASTLE>从站立姿势能看出他的脊椎弯曲度
<10-6,CASTLE>Posture is an indication of spine curvature.

720
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,780
<10-7,CASTLE>依此看  我估计他40岁出头
<10-7,CASTLE>I'd say it puts him in his early 40s.

721
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,650
<10-8,BECKETT>注意他的手
<10-8,BECKETT>Watch his hand.

722
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,330
<9-9,CASTLE>他做了两个特别的动作
<9-9,CASTLE>He makes two distinct movements.

723
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,220
<9-10,MAHONEY>他先是抓住哈里森先生的手臂
<9-10,MAHONEY>First he grabs Mr. Harrison's arm,

724
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,420
<7-5,RYAN>然后他把毒药交给了他
<7-5,RYAN>then he passes him the poison spray.

725
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,980
<7-6,GATES>他是个左撇子
<7-6,GATES>He's left-handed.

726
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,860
<7-7,ESPOSITO>再留意他的脖子
<7-7,ESPOSITO>And look at his neck.

727
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,930
<7-7,ESPOSITO>是块创可贴
<7-7,ESPOSITO>That's a bandage.

728
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,600
<4-1,RYAN>也许是最近弄伤了
<4-1,RYAN>Maybe covering up a recent injury

729
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,780
<4-2,ESPOSITO>或是掩盖纹身
<4-2,ESPOSITO>or a tattoo.

730
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,760
<4-3,RYAN>-对  -嘿
<4-3,RYAN>- Yeah. - Hey.

731
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,830
<17-3,BOYER>我知道这家伙是怎么
<17-3,BOYER>So I think I know how this guy

732
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,150
<17-4,RYAN>让科瑞帮他下毒的了
<17-4,RYAN>got Cory to poison the food.

733
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,750
<9-14,CASTLE>别告诉我是因为钱  我看过他的财务状况
<9-14,CASTLE>Don't say money. I've been through his financials.

734
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,680
<9-15,BECKETT>他不缺钱
<9-15,BECKETT>There's nothing there.

735
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,420
<23-1,BECKETT>可能是让他更难以拒绝的方式
<23-1,BECKETT>Might be something a lot more personal.

736
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,880
<24-1,BECKETT>我去调查了科瑞女儿上学的幼儿园
<24-1,BECKETT>I canvassed the preschool that Cory's daughter attends.

737
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,400
<22-24,BECKETT>我展示了录像截图
<22-24,BECKETT>A teacher recognized him

738
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,930
<22-25,NATALIE RHODES>一个老师认出了他
<22-25,NATALIE RHODES>when I showed her the screengrab.

739
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,810
<22-26,MADISON>在凶案前一天
<22-26,MADISON>Remembers seeing him

740
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,060
<22-27,LANIE>她发现他在学校附近出现
<22-27,LANIE>hanging around the school the day before.

741
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,770
<22-28,BECKETT>所以你觉得他拿科瑞的女儿来威胁他
<22-28,BECKETT>So you think he threatened to hurt the daughter

742
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,140
<17-4,RYAN>逼他去下毒
<17-4,RYAN>if Cory didn't poison the food?

743
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,720
<21-6,GATES>这也许解释了  他去上班时
<21-6,GATES>It might explain why he was so upset

744
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,990
<26-6,BECKETT>为何忧心忡忡的
<26-6,BECKETT>when he got to the restaurant.

745
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,150
<26-6,BECKETT>弹道检测得怎样了
<26-6,BECKETT>Where are we on ballistics?

746
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,760
<26-6,BECKETT>现场发现的弹头严重损毁了
<26-6,BECKETT>Slug from the crime scene is pretty mangled,

747
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,720
<26-6,BECKETT>但在数据库里有可能找得到匹配纪录
<26-6,BECKETT>but it's a possible match to another one in the system.

748
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,230
<26-6,BECKETT>过几个小时应该就有结果了
<26-6,BECKETT>We should know more in a few hours.

749
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,720
<26-6,BECKETT>好啦  爸
<26-6,BECKETT>Okay, dad.

750
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,960
<23-1,BECKETT>包装盒上说
<23-1,BECKETT>The box said something about

751
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,850
<29-1,BECKETT>本饮品含安神压惊的草药成分
<29-1,BECKETT>a soothing infusion of calming herbs.

752
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,600
<29-2,CASTLE>反正  这是安神茶  你得安安神
<29-2,CASTLE>Anyway, it's a calm tea, and you need to calm down.

753
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,330
<29-3,CASTLE>我怎么安得下来啊
<29-3,CASTLE>How am I supposed to calm down?

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,950
<29-4,BECKETT>他可是埃里克·沃恩
<29-4,BECKETT>It's Eric Vaughn.

755
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,810
<29-5,CASTLE>爸  贝克特那么喜欢你
<29-5,CASTLE>Dad, Beckett is over the moon for you.

756
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,730
<29-6,BECKETT>你就信任她一下嘛
<29-6,BECKETT>So give her a little credit, huh?

757
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,630
<29-7,CASTLE>这就跟她当年保护参议员布莱肯一样
<29-7,CASTLE>It's no different than when she was protecting Senator Bracken.

758
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,880
<29-8,BECKETT>是啊  你说得对
<29-8,BECKETT>Yeah, you're right.

759
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,390
<29-9,CASTLE>不过她保护布莱肯时
<29-9,CASTLE>Oh! Except for the fact that when it was Bracken,

760
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,150
<29-10,BECKETT>他们可没搞睡衣派对
<29-10,BECKETT>they weren't having a slumber party

761
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,970
<29-11,CASTLE>也没住豪华酒店
<29-11,CASTLE>at a fancy hotel.

762
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,050
<29-12,DICK COONAN>接受现实吧
<29-12,DICK COONAN>And let's face it.

763
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,300
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>跟布莱肯一比
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>Compared to Bracken,

764
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,070
<29-10,BECKETT>埃里克·沃恩帅得像乔治·克鲁尼一样
<29-10,BECKETT>Eric Vaughn is like George Clooney.

765
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,960
<29-7,CASTLE>才怪
<29-7,CASTLE>Oh, no.

766
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,040
<29-4,BECKETT>埃里克·沃恩比克鲁尼帅多了
<29-4,BECKETT>Eric Vaughn's way sexier than Clooney.

767
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,620
<29-1,BECKETT>本来就是嘛
<29-1,BECKETT>What? He is.

768
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,120
<26-8,RYAN>没错  而贝克特正在高级套房保护他呢
<26-8,RYAN>Yes, and Beckett is protecting him at the Fairwyck as we speak.

769
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,920
<26-9,BECKETT>哎妈呀
<26-9,BECKETT>Oops.

770
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,870
<26-10,ESPOSITO>我正在劝老爸  贝克特是个职业化的警察
<26-10,ESPOSITO>I was just reminding dad that Beckett is a professional

771
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,430
<26-11,CASTLE>而且对他一心一意
<26-11,CASTLE>and totally committed to their relationship.

772
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,370
<26-12,BECKETT>这个嘛
<26-12,BECKETT>Eh, well...

773
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,450
<26-13,RYAN>说不上一心一意
<26-13,RYAN>Not totally committed.

774
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,490
<26-13,RYAN>什么意思
<26-13,RYAN>What do you mean?

775
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,030
<26-13,RYAN>她手指上没戴戒指  对吧
<26-13,RYAN>Well, there isn't a ring on her finger, is there?

776
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,850
<31-1,CASTLE>-我  -按理说  她不完全一心一意
<31-1,CASTLE>- I... - Technically, she's not really committed at all.

777
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,190
<31-2,BECKETT>拜
<31-2,BECKETT>Ta.

841
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,200

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
<29-10,BECKETT>直接穿过他的头
<29-10,BECKETT>right through his head.

858
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,680
<29-11,CASTLE>巴伯怎么会射偏呢
<29-11,CASTLE>How did Barber miss?

859
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,730
<29-12,DICK COONAN>在第一枪前  沃恩绊了一跤
<29-12,DICK COONAN>Well, before the first shot, Vaughn stumbled.

860
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,320
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>绊了一跤
<29-13,JERRY TYSON>Stumbled?

861
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,500
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>他既不是小孩又不是老人怎么会站不稳呢
<29-14,JERRY TYSON>Kids and old people stumble. How did he stumble?

862
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,810
<29-15,CASTLE>我也不知道  他就是绊了一跤
<29-15,CASTLE>I don't know. He just did.

863
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,310
<29-16,BECKETT>所以说他先是吃错了菜
<29-16,BECKETT>So he ate the wrong entree

864
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,960
<29-17,BECKETT>没被毒死
<29-17,BECKETT>and avoided being poisoned,

865
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,730
<32-14,CASTLE>然后又时机刚好的绊了一跤
<32-14,CASTLE>And then he stumbled at just the right moment

866
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,890
<32-15,CASTLE>躲过了刺客穿过玻璃的子弹
<32-15,CASTLE>to avoid being shot by an assassin through a window.

867
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,630
<30-13,CASTLE>没人能这么幸运
<30-13,CASTLE>Nobody's that lucky.

868
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,640
<30-14,MARTHA>到底怎么回事  凯特
<30-14,MARTHA>What's going on here, kate?

869
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,660
<30-14,MARTHA>他吻了我  好了吧  卡塞尔
<30-14,MARTHA>He kissed me. Okay, Castle?

870
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,480
<30-14,MARTHA>他干什么了
<30-14,MARTHA>He what?

871
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,250
<22-1,MAHONEY>我觉得我该消失了
<22-1,MAHONEY>I think I have all I need here.

872
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,080
<22-2,CASTLE>听着  我没打算对你撒谎
<22-2,CASTLE>Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

873
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,000
<22-3,MAHONEY>我们正在谈论你
<22-3,MAHONEY>We were talking about you,

874
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,200
<22-4,BECKETT>正在谈论感情
<22-4,BECKETT>we were talking about relationships,

875
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,850
<22-5,MAHONEY>然后他就吻了我
<22-5,MAHONEY>and then he kissed me.

876
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,890
<22-6,CASTLE>但这并不代表什么
<22-6,CASTLE>But it didn't mean anything,

877
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,310
<22-7,BECKETT>起码对我来说不代表什么
<22-7,BECKETT>at least not to me.

878
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,810
<24-8,CASTLE>好吧  他亲了你
<24-8,CASTLE>Well, if he kissed you,

879
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,480
<24-9,BECKETT>你为什么就不把他推开呢
<24-9,BECKETT>why wouldn't you just push him away?

880
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,930
<24-10,CASTLE>这刚好
<24-10,CASTLE>Which is...

881
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,430
<24-11,CASTLE>是他还活着的原因
<24-11,CASTLE>why he's not dead.

882
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,420
<26-11,CASTLE>街对面酒店的前台
<26-11,CASTLE>The front desk clerk from the hotel across the street

883
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,290
<26-11,CASTLE>认出了托马斯·巴伯
<26-11,CASTLE>positively identified Thomas Barber.

884
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,090
<26-11,CASTLE>说他用假名入住了那里
<26-11,CASTLE>Said he was staying under an assumed name.

885
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,080
<26-11,CASTLE>找到他了吗
<26-11,CASTLE>Any sign of him?

886
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,730
<26-11,CASTLE>没有  但是他房间的电话记录
<26-11,CASTLE>No, but the phone records from his room

887
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,430
<26-11,CASTLE>显示他给一个号码打了好几次电话
<26-11,CASTLE>show that he made several calls to a single number.

888
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,700
<40-1,RYAN>你绝对猜不到他打给谁了
<40-1,RYAN>You'll never guess who Barber was calling.

889
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,470
<40-2,CASTLE>帕拉蒂小姐
<40-2,CASTLE>Ms. Paralti,

890
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,610
<24-2,CASTLE>从你上次来这里之后
<24-2,CASTLE>Some additional information has come to light

891
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,350
<24-3,BECKETT>我们又有了新的信息
<24-3,BECKETT>since you were last here.

892
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,680
<28-1,MAHONEY>比如说你爸爸
<28-1,MAHONEY>Like the fact that your father

893
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,490
<26-8,RYAN>曾经财政紧张
<26-8,RYAN>was in financial dire straights

894
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,810
<26-9,BECKETT>欠了七万五千美元
<26-9,BECKETT>to the tune of $75,000.

895
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,580
<26-10,ESPOSITO>他差点丢了家族农场  但是突然之间
<26-10,ESPOSITO>He nearly lost the family farm, and then suddenly...

896
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,770
<26-11,CASTLE>他保住了
<26-11,CASTLE>He didn't.

897
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,720
<26-12,BECKETT>这件事又有什么关系
<26-12,BECKETT>What does that have to do with anything?

898
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,570
<26-13,RYAN>这或许能解释
<26-13,RYAN>Well, it may explain

899
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,730
<24-13,BRIAN>你为什么做了平时不会做的事情
<24-13,BRIAN>why you did something you otherwise wouldn't.

900
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,480
<24-14,CASTLE>比如说用致命剂量的神经毒素
<24-14,CASTLE>Like turn over a lethal dose of neurotoxin

901
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,640
<24-15,CASTLE>来换钱偿还欠款
<24-15,CASTLE>in exchange for the money to pay off that debt.

902
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,260
<24-16,CASTLE>我不懂你在说什么
<24-16,CASTLE>I don't know what you're talking about.

903
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,920
<24-17,CASTLE>这是什么
<24-17,CASTLE>What's this?

904
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,760
<32-6,CASTLE>托马斯·巴伯的电话记录
<32-6,CASTLE>The records of phone calls made by Thomas Barber,

905
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,360
<31-3,CASTLE>他是名职业杀手
<31-3,CASTLE>a contract killer.

906
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,950
<31-4,BECKETT>这是他给你打的电话
<31-4,BECKETT>Phone calls that he made to you.

907
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,860
<31-5,CASTLE>听着  求你们了
<31-5,CASTLE>Look, please, I...

908
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,250
<31-6,BECKETT>我不知道他打算害人的
<31-6,BECKETT>I didn't know he was gonna hurt anyone.

909
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,900
<31-7,CASTLE>他说自己是竞争对手的人
<31-7,CASTLE>He told me he was from a rival lab,

910
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,230
<31-8,BECKETT>他们想先获得专利
<31-8,BECKETT>that they wanted the patent first.

911
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,500
<31-9,CASTLE>我很生埃里克的气
<31-9,CASTLE>I was mad at Eric, a--

912
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,270
<31-10,CASTLE>我也需要钱
<31-10,CASTLE>and I needed the money.

913
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,540
<31-11,BECKETT>-你们在哪里见面  -我们没见过
<31-11,BECKETT>- Where did you meet? - We didn't.

914
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,340
<31-11,BECKETT>我们打电话
<31-11,BECKETT>We talked on the phone,

915
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,480
<31-11,BECKETT>然后我把药放在事先约好的地方
<31-11,BECKETT>and I dropped the vial at a prearranged place.

916
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,090
<31-11,BECKETT>你是怎么拿钱的
<31-11,BECKETT>How did you get paid?

917
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,080
<6-2,BECKETT>他告诉我去开一个离岸账户
<6-2,BECKETT>He told me to set up an offshore account.

918
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,130
<6-3,CASTLE>在我送完药后  钱就汇来了
<6-3,CASTLE>The day after the drop, the money just appeared.

919
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,910
<6-4,BECKETT>伙计们  看看
<6-4,BECKETT>Hey, guys, check it out.

920
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,910
<6-5,CASTLE>钱是通过银行汇款到户的
<6-5,CASTLE>The money arrived via a wire transfer.

921
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,460
<6-6,BECKETT>有了辛迪的配合
<6-6,BECKETT>With Cindy's cooperation,

922
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,600
<11-1,BECKETT>我们追踪到了一个墨西哥能源公司
<11-1,BECKETT>we were able to track it to a Mexican energy company

923
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,280
<11-1,BECKETT>名叫墨日能源
<11-1,BECKETT>called Mexisolar.

924
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,090
<30-8,BECKETT>我听埃里克谈起过这个公司
<30-8,BECKETT>I heard Eric talk about this.

925
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,420
<30-9,CASTLE>这个墨西哥太阳能公司和埃里克·沃恩有何关系
<30-9,CASTLE>What does a Mexican solar company have to do with Eric Vaughn?

926
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,370
<30-10,BECKETT>公司是他的
<30-10,BECKETT>He owns it.

927
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,320
<30-11,CASTLE>事实上  亚瑟·菲尔德被毒害的当晚
<30-11,CASTLE>In fact, the night that Arthur Felder was poisoned,

928
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,470
<30-12,BECKETT>他和埃里克·沃恩安排去参观公司
<30-12,BECKETT>He and Eric Vaughn were arranging a site visit to the company

929
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,320
<30-13,CASTLE>因为菲尔德想要翻倍他的投资
<30-13,CASTLE>because Felder wanted to double-up his investment.

930
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,370
<30-14,MARTHA>所以无论发生什么事
<30-14,MARTHA>So whatever's going on,

931
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,960
<22-13,BECKETT>都是和公司有关的
<22-13,BECKETT>it has to involve this company.

932
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,180
<22-14,CASTLE>是  但是贝克特  还有呢
<22-14,CASTLE>Yeah, but, Beckett, there's more.

933
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,750
<28-6,CASTLE>授权汇款到辛迪账户的人
<28-6,CASTLE>The person who authorized the wire transfer

934
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,980
<28-7,MAHONEY>就是埃里克·沃恩
<28-7,MAHONEY>into Cindy's account was Eric vaughn.

935
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,320
<28-8,BECKETT>似乎他就是幕后指使
<28-8,BECKETT>It looks like he's behind this whole thing.

936
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,730
<28-9,CASTLE>这不可能
<28-9,CASTLE>That can't be right.

937
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,210
<28-9,CASTLE>我刚刚和提华纳的顾问通过电话
<28-9,CASTLE>Yo. I just got off the phone with the consulate in Tijuana.

938
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,810
<28-9,CASTLE>这个公司 墨日能源
<28-9,CASTLE>This company--Mexisolar--

939
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,090
<28-9,CASTLE>根本就不存在
<28-9,CASTLE>It doesn't exist.

940
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,620
<34-1,ESPOSITO>他们几个月前就关闭了墨西卡利的工厂
<34-1,ESPOSITO>They shut down the factory in Mexicali months ago.

941
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,970
<34-2,DIEGO>什么  这说不通
<34-2,DIEGO>What? This is making no sense.

942
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,280
<34-3,RYAN>正相反  我的朋友们
<34-3,RYAN>Au contraire, my friends.

943
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,370
<34-4,ESPOSITO>这案子头一回合情合理了
<34-4,ESPOSITO>For the first time, this is making perfect sense.

944
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,030
<34-5,DIEGO>墨日能源
<34-5,DIEGO>Mexisolar...

945
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,570
<34-5,DIEGO>是个骗局
<34-5,DIEGO>is a scam.

946
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,730
<34-5,DIEGO>埃里克·沃恩在利用它欺诈投资者
<34-5,DIEGO>Eric Vaughn's been using it to fleece his investors.

947
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,110
<34-5,DIEGO>卡塞尔  沃恩身价十亿美元
<34-5,DIEGO>Castle, Vaughn is worth a billion dollars.

948
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,710
<34-5,DIEGO>他不会诈骗的
<34-5,DIEGO>He's not gonna be running scams.

949
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,450
<34-5,DIEGO>贝克特
<34-5,DIEGO>Oh, Beckett.

950
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,460
<23-1,BECKETT>当年他们也是这么说伯尼·麦道夫的
<23-1,BECKETT>That's what they said about Bernie Madoff.

952
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,180
<21-3,GATES>跟麦道夫一样  很可能
<21-3,GATES>And like madoff, it's quite possible

953
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,170
<21-4,ESPOSITO>沃恩的整个帝国都是空中阁楼
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Vaughn's entire empire is a house of cards.

954
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,360
<21-5,RYAN>如果菲尔德要去墨日能源工厂参观
<21-5,RYAN>If Felder was going to visit the Mexisolar factory,

955
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,950
<21-5,RYAN>他就会发现这个骗局
<21-5,RYAN>he'd have found out about the scam.

956
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,340
<21-5,RYAN>空中阁楼就会土崩瓦解
<21-5,RYAN>The house of cards would collapse.

957
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,360
<21-5,RYAN>这埃里克·沃恩不能接受
<21-5,RYAN>Eric Vaughn couldn't have that.

958
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,370
<21-5,RYAN>而要逍遥法外  有什么法子会比
<21-5,RYAN>And what better way to get away with murder

959
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,400
<21-5,RYAN>让自己看来就是袭击目标更好的呢
<21-5,RYAN>Than by making yourself look to be the intended target?

960
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,420
<32-1,CASTLE>你们难道不明白吗
<32-1,CASTLE>Don't you see?

961
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,700
<32-2,BECKETT>这整件事就是个谜中谜
<32-2,BECKETT>This entire thing is a charade.

962
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,020
<32-3,CASTLE>他就是我们的凶手
<32-3,CASTLE>He's our killer.

963
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,130
<30-7,CASTLE>他耍了我们
<30-7,CASTLE>He played us.

964
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,270
<30-8,BECKETT>主要是你
<30-8,BECKETT>Well, mostly you.

965
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,730
<30-9,CASTLE>听了这么多年招供
<30-9,CASTLE>Of all the confessions over all the years,

966
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,950
<30-10,BECKETT>这一次的
<30-10,BECKETT>this one...

967
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,950
<30-11,CASTLE>会在我心里留下特殊的位置
<30-11,CASTLE>is going to hold a special place in my heart.

968
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,450
<30-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我打算自己
<30-12,BECKETT>Castle, I'm going in there...

969
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,800
<35-5,BECKETT>进去
<35-5,BECKETT>Alone.

970
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,590
<29-8,BECKETT>但我们是个团队
<29-8,BECKETT>But we're a team,

971
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,340
<29-9,CASTLE>而且我迫切地需要看着他崩溃
<29-9,CASTLE>and the universe demands that I see him crumble.

972
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,170
<29-10,BECKETT>不  招供是要把沃恩绳之以法
<29-10,BECKETT>No, this one has to be about putting Vaughn away

973
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,530
<29-11,CASTLE>其他无关紧要
<29-11,CASTLE>and nothing else.

974
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,950
<29-12,DICK COONAN>别担心  他会崩溃的
<29-12,DICK COONAN>And don't worry. He will crumble.

975
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,100
<36-1,JIM BECKETT>把百叶窗开着
<36-1,JIM BECKETT>Leave the blinds open.

976
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,960
<26-4,BECKETT>我不知道我该对哪件事更不安
<26-4,BECKETT>I'm not sure which I should be more disturbed about,

977
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,610
<26-5,CASTLE>是有人想要对我一枪爆头
<26-5,CASTLE>that someone tried to shoot my head off

978
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,830
<26-6,BECKETT>还是我试图亲你的时候  你推开了我
<26-6,BECKETT>or that you pushed me away when I kissed you.

979
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,500
<26-2,BECKETT>我们谈谈吧
<26-2,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, let's-- let's talk about that,

980
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,130
<26-3,ESPOSITO>谈谈你生命中的那些企图
<26-3,ESPOSITO>about these attempts on your life,

981
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,110
<29-7,CASTLE>谈谈墨日能源
<29-7,CASTLE>about Mexisolar.

982
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,150
<30-2,CASTLE>-墨日能源  -你的公司
<30-2,CASTLE>- Mexisolar? - Your company.

983
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,620
<30-3,BECKETT>那家并不存在的公司
<30-3,BECKETT>The one that doesn't exist.

984
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,800
<30-3,BECKETT>它当然存在
<30-3,BECKETT>Of course it exists.

985
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,440
<30-3,BECKETT>否则我会知道的  我创办了它
<30-3,BECKETT>I should know, I founded it

986
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,060
<30-3,BECKETT>投资了数百万
<30-3,BECKETT>and invested millions.

987
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,490
<30-3,BECKETT>对  亚瑟·菲尔德也是
<30-3,BECKETT>Right, so did Arthur Felder.

988
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:32,680
<30-3,BECKETT>准确地说是三千万美元
<30-3,BECKETT>$30 million, to be exact.

989
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,860
<30-3,BECKETT>现在都一去不返了
<30-3,BECKETT>And now it's all gone.

990
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,970
<30-3,BECKETT>这是什么  玩笑吗
<30-3,BECKETT>What is this, a joke?

991
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,010
<23-1,BECKETT>这不是玩笑  这就是墨日能源
<23-1,BECKETT>It's not a joke. That's Mexisolar.

992
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,320
<23-2,CASTLE>不不  这太疯狂了
<23-2,CASTLE>No, no, this is crazy.

993
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,740
<23-3,BECKETT>这家公司没有赤字
<23-3,BECKETT>The company's completely solvent.

994
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,010
<23-4,CASTLE>我们的工厂是最先进的
<23-4,CASTLE>Our factory is state-of-the-art.

995
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,690
<23-4,CASTLE>我看过现金流报告  签订的合同
<23-4,CASTLE>I've seen cash flow reports, signed contracts.

996
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,840
<23-5,CASTLE>你是说这些吗
<23-5,CASTLE>You mean like these?

997
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,390
<23-6,CASTLE>它们是伪造的
<23-6,CASTLE>They're fraudulent.

998
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,540
<23-6,CASTLE>这不可能
<23-6,CASTLE>That's not possible.

999
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,030
<23-7,CASTLE>这怎么不可能  都是你签了字的
<23-7,CASTLE>How is it not possible? You signed them.

1000
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,090
<31-1,CASTLE>我的员工每天要让我签几十份文件
<31-1,CASTLE>Look, my staff give me dozens of documents to sign every day.

1001
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,540
<31-2,BECKETT>-可这是你的公司  -对
<31-2,BECKETT>- It's your company. - Yes.

1002
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,140
<31-3,CASTLE>但我不会每天核查
<31-3,CASTLE>But I don't oversee the day to day.

1003
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,700
<31-4,BECKETT>那谁会
<31-4,BECKETT>Then who does?

1004
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,220
<31-5,CASTLE>故事很精彩  警探
<31-5,CASTLE>That is quite a story, detective.

1005
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,280
<25-2,CASTLE>确实  具备一切精彩的元素
<25-2,CASTLE>Oh, it is. It's got everything--

1006
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,590
<32-27,CASTLE>盗窃  背叛  谋杀
<32-27,CASTLE>Larceny, betrayal, murder,

1007
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,560
<23-3,BECKETT>还有你  通过墨日能源劫走数百万
<23-3,BECKETT>And you looting millions from mexisolar.

1008
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,490
<23-4,CASTLE>而你都让埃里克·沃恩签署所有的报告
<23-4,CASTLE>But since you had Eric Vaughn signing off on all of the reports,

1009
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,420
<23-5,CASTLE>所以没有人会严格审查这家公司
<23-5,CASTLE>no one took a hard look at the company.

1010
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,770
<23-7,CASTLE>直到亚瑟·菲尔德想知道他的钱都用在哪了
<23-7,CASTLE>Until Arthur Felder wanted to see where his money was going.

1011
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,210
<23-8,BECKETT>而你不能让这种事发生  对吗
<23-8,BECKETT>And you couldn't have that, could you?

1012
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,920
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>你们认为我杀了亚瑟·菲尔德
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>Uh, you think I killed Arthur Felder?

1013
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,430
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>是的  但你想杀死的人是沃恩
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>Yes, but it was Vaughn that you wanted dead.

1014
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,100
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>你知道那些文件记录会让这看上去像是
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>You knew that the paper trail would make it look like

1015
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,710
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>他从公司贪污了钱
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>he had embezzled money from the company.

1016
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,160
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>所以你雇了杀手
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>So you hired a hit man,

1017
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,410
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>只不过他杀错了人
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>except he killed the wrong guy. Oops.

1018
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,110
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>你们口说无凭
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>You have no proof of any of this.

1019
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,520
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>别这么肯定
<31-16,CASTLE_BECKETT>Don't be so sure.

1020
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,530
<24-1,BECKETT>给辛迪·帕拉蒂转钱的那家银行
<24-1,BECKETT>The bank that transferred the money to Cindy Paralti

1021
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,390
<24-1,BECKETT>截获了IP地址
<24-1,BECKETT>captured an I.P. Address,

1022
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,330
<32-1,CASTLE>他们追踪到了你的电脑
<32-1,CASTLE>and they traced it back to your computer.

1023
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,690
<32-2,BECKETT>结束了  大卫
<32-2,BECKETT>It's over, David.

1024
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,500
<32-3,CASTLE>我没有偷那笔钱
<32-3,CASTLE>Look, I didn't steal that money.

1025
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:03,420
<32-4,ESPOSITO>我只是拿它下了注  可运气不佳
<32-4,ESPOSITO>I just made some bets with it that underperformed.

1026
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,550
<32-5,CASTLE>我拿了新墨日能源的资金  增加了一倍投入
<32-5,CASTLE>I-I-I took the new Mexisolar funding, and I doubled down.

1027
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,960
<32-6,CASTLE>要是埃里克  也会这么做的
<32-6,CASTLE>I mean, that's what Eric would have done.

1028
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,920
<32-7,BECKETT>该死
<32-7,BECKETT>Damn it.

1029
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,120
<32-8,CASTLE>这个娄子越捅越大
<32-8,CASTLE>The hole just getting deeper and deeper.

1030
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,640
<32-9,CASTLE>事情一经败露  就意味着坐牢
<32-9,CASTLE>It all would've come out, and it would've meant prison.

1031
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,380
<32-10,BECKETT>我别无选择
<32-10,BECKETT>I had no choice.

1032
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,960
<34-6,RYAN>真是奇妙啊  你可以认识一个人十年
<34-6,RYAN>It's amazing how you can know someone for ten years

1033
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,820
<34-7,DIEGO>却对他们一无所知
<34-7,DIEGO>and never really know them at all...

1034
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
<34-7,DIEGO>而有的人认识才几天
<34-7,DIEGO>And know someone for a few days, and...

1035
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,210
<34-7,DIEGO>就好像已经十分熟悉
<34-7,DIEGO>feel like you know them so well.

1036
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,080
<34-7,DIEGO>有件事告诉你  你会很高兴
<34-7,DIEGO>Well, you will be happy to know
