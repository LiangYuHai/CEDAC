00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,970
<16-15,RYAN>你昨晚很晚才回来  有案子吗
<16-15,RYAN>You got in late last night. Catch a case?

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,240
<26-10,CASTLE>是的
<26-10,CASTLE>Yeah.

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,890
<26-11,BECKETT>就是报上的这桩案子
<26-11,BECKETT>Actually, it was this one.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,640
<26-12,CASTLE>有人炸了市中心一间公寓
<26-12,CASTLE>Someone blew up an apartment downtown.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,600
<26-13,BECKETT>不是吧  你居然没打电话给我
<26-13,BECKETT>Seriously? And you didn't call me?

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,920
<26-14,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你说你有一章必须要写完
<26-14,CASTLE>Castle, you said you had a chapter due.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,960
<26-14,CASTLE>对于作家来说  潜台词就是"尽请耽误我吧"
<26-14,CASTLE>Yes, which is writer speak for "All procrastination's welcome".

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,870
<26-14,CASTLE>是什么情况  恐怖分子阴谋  毒品工厂
<26-14,CASTLE>So what was it, a terrorist plot, a meth lab?

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,540
<26-14,CASTLE>排查到有一名男子
<26-14,CASTLE>The canvass turned up a description of a guy

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,050
<26-14,CASTLE>驾驶银色掀背式汽车逃离现场
<26-14,CASTLE>fleeing the scene in a silver hatchback.

19
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,530
<26-14,CASTLE>我们申请了交通监控录像
<26-14,CASTLE>And we called in for traffic cam footage...

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,820
<24-1,BECKETT>有可能有结果了  我得走了
<24-1,BECKETT>Which is probably already in, so I gotta get going.

21
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,280
<24-2,ERIC>或者  你可以叫埃斯波西托查看录像
<24-2,ERIC>Or... You could have Esposito check that out.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,360
<24-2,ERIC>他很擅长这个  我感觉好久没看到你了
<24-2,ERIC>He's very good at it. I feel like I haven't seen you in days.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,370
<24-2,ERIC>我真的得走了  但是
<24-2,ERIC>You know, I really do have to get going,but--

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,820
<24-2,ERIC>但是你无力拒绝我  你一直是这样
<24-2,ERIC>But you're powerless to resist me. You always have been.

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,050
<24-2,ERIC>真的吗
<24-2,ERIC>Really?

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,040
<24-2,ERIC>还记得我们初次见面吗  我觉得你是个混蛋
<24-2,ERIC>Do you remember when we first met? I kinda thought you were an ass.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,350
<24-2,ERIC>我知道你假装成那样  但是别装了
<24-2,ERIC>Oh, I know you pretended you thought that. But come on.

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,860
<24-2,ERIC>我们现在在一起了  你可以承认了
<24-2,ERIC>We're together now. You can admit it.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,210
<24-2,ERIC>你对我  是一见钟情
<24-2,ERIC>You fell for me the first moment you saw me.

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,690
<24-2,ERIC>-我没有  -拜托  你就是
<24-2,ERIC>- No, I didn't. - Please. You did.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,090
<24-2,ERIC>-你真这样想  对吗  -这是事实
<24-2,ERIC>- You believe that, don't you? - It's true.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,320
<24-2,ERIC>等等
<24-2,ERIC>Oh, hold on.

34
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,650
<24-2,ERIC>好  我马上来
<24-2,ERIC>Okay. I'll be right there.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,040
<24-2,ERIC>交通监控录像中已经找到了匹配车牌
<24-2,ERIC>Traffic cam footage turned up a match to the plates.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,380
<30-1,BECKETT>-找到人了  -非常好
<30-1,BECKETT>- We got him. - Nice.

37
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,050
<30-2,ERIC>等等  等等
<30-2,ERIC>Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,570
<30-3,BECKETT>-看到杯里的心了吗  -我们走  卡塞尔
<30-3,BECKETT>- Did you see the hearts? - Let's go, Castle.

39
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,400
<30-4,ERIC>花了我  大约六分钟时间
<30-4,ERIC>Took me, like... six minutes.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,720
<30-4,ERIC>车牌登记在阿奇博尔德·弗希名下
<30-4,ERIC>The car's license plate was registered to Archibald Fosse.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,680
<25-1,ESPOSITO>他独自一人住在一栋四层的公寓
<25-1,ESPOSITO>He lives alone in a fourth-floor apartment.

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,590
<27-13,ESPOSITO>这也不是他第一次犯案
<27-13,ESPOSITO>This isn't his first rodeo, either.

43
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,950
<27-14,RYAN>他六年前赌马失败
<27-14,RYAN>He got in trouble playing the ponies

44
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,150
<33-5,BECKETT>用汽车炸弹解决掉了他的投注人
<33-5,BECKETT>so he took out his bookie with a car bomb six years ago.

45
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,530
<33-6,RYAN>才六年他就被放出来了吗
<33-6,RYAN>Six years and he's already out?

46
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,530
<33-7,BECKETT>他本来是应该被判20年到无期的
<33-7,BECKETT>Well, he was supposed to do 20 years to life.

47
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,880
<33-8,ESPOSITO>但他的案子三个月前上诉成功
<33-8,ESPOSITO>But his case got overturned on appeal three months ago.

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,830
<32-4,BECKETT>知道昨晚爆炸的动机吗
<32-4,BECKETT>Any idea about the motivation for last night's bombing?

49
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,910
<32-5,CASTLE>不知道  20分钟前刚确定他的身份
<32-5,CASTLE>No, we just ID'ed him 20 minutes ago.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,450
<32-6,CINDY>还有许多情况我们不知道
<32-6,CINDY>There's a lot we have to learn about him yet.

51
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,810
<32-7,CINDY>贝克特  这位是迪亚哥·胡梅纳兹
<32-7,CINDY>Yo, Beckett. This is Diego Jiminez.

52
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,790
<32-8,BECKETT>他去见弗希先生  被警员拦了下来
<32-8,BECKETT>Uniforms intercepted him on his way up to pay Mr. Fosse a visit.

53
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,600
<32-9,CINDY>你怎么认识他的
<32-9,CINDY>How do you know him?

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,890
<32-10,CASTLE>我不认识  真的  我根本没见过他
<32-10,CASTLE>I don't, really. I've never even met him.

55
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,000
<32-11,CINDY>我们是网上联系的  我是个收藏家
<32-11,CINDY>We connected on-line. I'm a collector.

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,150
<25-9,RYAN>他说他有些三十年代的棒球卡想卖
<25-9,RYAN>He said he had some baseball cards from the '30s he wanted to sell.

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,790
<25-10,CASTLE>就是这样
<25-10,CASTLE>That's all.

58
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,620
<25-11,GATES>至少我们知道
<25-11,GATES>Well, we know this much.

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,680
<26-2,BECKETT>如果迪亚哥约好和他见面  弗希可能在家
<26-2,BECKETT>If Diego had an appointment, Fosse's probably in there.

60
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,830
<26-3,BECKETT>警察  快快  上上上
<26-3,BECKETT>Police! Move! Move! Go! Go! Go!

61
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,290
<26-4,CASTLE>纽约警察
<26-4,CASTLE>NYPD!

62
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,830
<26-5,BECKETT>莱恩  埃斯波  他朝你们过去了
<26-5,BECKETT>Ryan, Espo, he's coming your way.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,000
<26-6,CASTLE>不许动  纽约警察
<26-6,CASTLE>Freeze! NYPD!

<26-7,BECKETT>Let me see your hands.

<26-8,CASTLE>扔下  马上扔下
<26-8,CASTLE>Drop it! Drop it now!

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,680
<26-9,BECKETT>这是什么  为什么在闪光
<26-9,BECKETT>What is that? Why is it flashing?

67
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,840
<26-10,CASTLE>回答我  回答我
<26-10,CASTLE>Answer me! Answer me!

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,100
<26-11,BECKETT>棒球卡  和他说的一样
<26-11,BECKETT>Baseball cards, just like he said.

69
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,770
<26-12,CASTLE>贝克特  卡塞尔  马上离开
<26-12,CASTLE>Beckett, Castle, get outta there now.

70
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,420
<26-13,BECKETT>嫌疑人的口袋里有一种什么装置
<26-13,BECKETT>The suspect had some kind of device in his pocket.

71
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,630
<26-1,ERIC>我想他装了炸弹
<26-1,ERIC>I think he armed something.

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,370
<26-2,BECKETT>收到  所有人出去  快走  大家快走
<26-2,BECKETT>Copy that. Everyone out now. Let's go. You guys, out.

73
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,820
<26-4,CASTLE>怎么回事
<26-4,CASTLE>What was that?

74
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,130
<26-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<26-5,BECKETT>Castle...

75
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,800
<26-8,CASTLE>我想我站在炸弹上
<26-8,CASTLE>I think I'm standing on a bomb.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,390
<26-9,BECKETT>你觉得我们要在这里站多久
<26-9,BECKETT>How long do you think we'll have to stand here?

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,260
<23-5,BRUNO>一旦拆弹小组结束检查
<23-5,BRUNO>Once bomb disposal finishes their sweep,

87
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,120
<23-6,CASTLE>就会知道是否有其它炸弹
<23-6,CASTLE>we'll know if there are any other bombs you could step on,

88
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
<23-7,BRUNO>还是说我站在唯一的炸弹上
<23-7,BRUNO>or if I'm standing on the only one.

89
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,330
<27-8,TORY>还不知道那是不是炸弹呢  也许没什么
<27-8,TORY>We don't know that you're standing on a bomb. It could be nothing.

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,320
<27-8,TORY>感觉不像没什么  我脚下有东西陷下去了
<27-8,TORY>It didn't feel like nothing. Something gave way under my feet.

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,880
<27-8,TORY>感觉像是触发器
<27-8,TORY>It felt like a trigger plate.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,870
<27-8,TORY>有可能是松动的地板
<27-8,TORY>Could be a wonky floorboard.

93
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,980
<33-4,RYAN>会有金属的滴答声吗
<33-4,RYAN>With a metallic click?

94
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,740
<33-5,BECKETT>钉子松了  所以木地板才会松动
<33-5,BECKETT>Loose nail. That's how floorboards get wonky.

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,690
<33-6,RYAN>希望你是对的
<33-6,RYAN>Well, I hope you're right.

96
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,450
<33-7,BECKETT>我是对的  想想吧
<33-7,BECKETT>I'm right. I mean, think about it.

97
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,380
<33-8,ESPOSITO>谁会把炸弹放在自己的家里
<33-8,ESPOSITO>Who puts a live bomb in their own apartment?

98
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,000
<33-9,BECKETT>没有道理
<33-9,BECKETT>It makes no sense.

99
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,330
<33-9,BECKETT>你饿了吗
<33-9,BECKETT>You hungry?

100
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,930
<25-1,ESPOSITO>为什么问
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Why?

101
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,290
<25-2,GATES>因为随时会有人从那道门进来
<25-2,GATES>Because any minute, someone's gonna come through that door

102
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,240
<25-3,ESPOSITO>告诉我们安全了
<25-3,ESPOSITO>and give us the all clear.

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,330
<25-4,CASTLE>离这里不到三条街  有家非常棒的小吃店
<25-4,CASTLE>And there is an amazing diner not three blocks from here.

104
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,950
<25-5,ESPOSITO>我今早的确没吃早餐
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah? Well,I did miss my breakfast this morning.

105
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,920
<29-5,BECKETT>是的
<29-5,BECKETT>Yeah.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,690
<29-6,RYAN>他们家的拿铁泡沫丰富  可好喝了
<29-6,RYAN>They make these incredible, foamy lattes--

107
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,520
<29-7,BECKETT>杯子有你脑袋那么大
<29-7,BECKETT>Cups as big as your head--

108
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,640
<29-8,ESPOSITO>山羊奶酪煎蛋卷真是好吃到死
<29-8,ESPOSITO>And a goat cheese omelet to die for.

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,110
<30-10,ERIC>我可能用词不当
<30-10,ERIC>Which would be a poor choice of words

110
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,250
<30-11,BECKETT>如果你真的站在炸弹上的话  不过你猜怎样
<30-11,BECKETT>if you were standing on a bomb, but guess what.

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,150
<30-12,ERIC>你没有站在炸弹上
<30-12,ERIC>You're not.

112
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,040
<26-11,BECKETT>如果我非得被困住
<26-11,BECKETT>You know, if I have to be, uh, stuck...

113
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,850
<26-11,BECKETT>不是站在炸弹上  我很高兴是和你困在一起
<26-11,BECKETT>Not standing on a bomb, then I'm glad I'm stuck with you.

114
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,700
<12-13,VICTORIA GATES>我知道
<12-13,VICTORIA GATES>I know.

115
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,450
<12-14,BECKETT>我是拆弹小组的马霍尼警监
<12-14,BECKETT>Captain Mahoney, bomb disposal unit.

116
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,910
<12-15,GATES>你们谁是贝克特探长
<12-15,GATES>Which one of you is detective Beckett?

117
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,750
<12-16,CASTLE>我是贝克特探长  这位是卡塞尔
<12-16,CASTLE>I'm detective Beckett. This is Castle.

118
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,130
<12-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你可以放轻松
<12-17,BECKETT>Castle, you can relax.

119
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,220
<12-18,GATES>我们在楼下用X光检查了整间公寓
<12-18,GATES>We've x-rayed the entire apartment from the floor below.

120
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,870
<29-1,RYAN>没有其它爆炸物
<29-1,RYAN>There are no other explosives.

121
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,720
<29-2,BECKETT>没有其它爆炸物  那么
<29-2,BECKETT>No other explosives? So...

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,940
<29-2,BECKETT>探长  恐怕你站在
<29-2,BECKETT>Detective, I'm afraid you've stepped on

123
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,240
<29-2,BECKETT>连接炸药的传感器上
<29-2,BECKETT>a sensor plate wired to a detonator.

124
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,980
<29-2,BECKETT>传感器上负重  就像是扣上了枪的扳机
<29-2,BECKETT>Depressing that plate was sort of like cocking the hammer of a gun.

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,460
<29-2,BECKETT>你离开  重量消失  就等同开枪
<29-2,BECKETT>You take your weight off there, it's like pulling the trigger.

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,980
<26-1,ERIC>所以最重要的就是你不能动
<26-1,ERIC>So it's very important that you don't move

127
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,920
<26-2,BECKETT>直到我们想到办法拆弹为止
<26-2,BECKETT>until we figure out how to disarm it.

128
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,790
<26-2,BECKETT>拆弹小组刚刚确认了
<26-2,BECKETT>B.D.U. just confirmed it.

129
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,460
<26-2,BECKETT>贝克特站在炸弹上
<26-2,BECKETT>Beckett's standing on a bomb.

130
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,240
<26-2,BECKETT>痕量探测估算有十公斤炸药
<26-2,BECKETT>Trace detection estimates 10 kilograms of R.D.X.

131
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,950
<26-2,BECKETT>足以炸毁整栋公寓
<26-2,BECKETT>Enough to take out the whole building.

132
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,390
<27-1,ESPOSITO>有什么打算
<27-1,ESPOSITO>So what's the plan?

133
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,280
<27-2,TECH AGENT TORY ELLIS>长官  他们有所打算的吧
<27-2,TECH AGENT TORY ELLIS>Sir, tell me there's a plan.

134
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,340
<27-3,ESPOSITO>他们在处理  那个炸弹狂查得怎么样
<27-3,ESPOSITO>They're working on it. What do we have on that bomber?

135
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,780
<27-4,TORY>看样子作案动机是为了报仇
<27-4,TORY>Looks like his motive was revenge.

136
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,670
<27-5,ESPOSITO>凯利·兰瑟  那个昨晚被他炸死的女人
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Kelly Runther, the woman he blew up last night,

137
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,980
<27-6,TORY>六年前曾指证他纵火
<27-6,TORY>testified against him at his arson trial six years ago.

138
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,010
<16-24,ESPOSITO>那为什么要在自家公寓放炸弹
<16-24,ESPOSITO>Then why would he booby-trap his own apartment?

139
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,070
<27-6,TORY>审讯时辩方声称
<27-6,TORY>The defense at his trial centered on allegations

140
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,700
<17-2,RYAN>警方篡改了证物
<17-2,RYAN>of evidence tampering by police, so...

141
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,300
<17-2,RYAN>所以他憎恨警察
<17-2,RYAN>He's got a vendetta against cops.

142
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,040
<17-2,RYAN>是的  长官  他一手策划了此事
<17-2,RYAN>Yes, sir. He wanted this to happen.

143
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,930
<17-2,RYAN>别让他得逞
<17-2,RYAN>Well, we're not gonna let it.

144
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,210
<17-2,RYAN>问出点东西来
<17-2,RYAN>You get him in the box.

145
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,610
<17-2,RYAN>我要知道怎么拆除那个炸弹
<17-2,RYAN>I want to know how to deactivate that bomb.

146
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
<17-2,RYAN>你们凭什么觉得那炸弹可以拆除
<17-2,RYAN>What makes you think it can be deactivated?

147
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,250
<17-2,RYAN>你最好祈祷可以  因为站在那炸弹上的人
<17-2,RYAN>You better pray that it can, because the person standing on it,

148
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,750
<17-2,RYAN>是我的朋友
<17-2,RYAN>she's a friend of mine.

149
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,520
<17-2,RYAN>那她命不久矣了
<17-2,RYAN>Not for long.

150
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,750
<17-2,RYAN>你错了
<17-2,RYAN>That's where you're wrong.

151
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,230
<17-2,RYAN>你会帮我们  你知道那炸弹是怎么制造的
<17-2,RYAN>See, you're gonna help us. You know how the bomb is made.

152
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,860
<17-2,RYAN>雷管  起爆装置  还有其它小部件
<17-2,RYAN>The detonator, the fuse, all the other little parts--

153
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,530
<24-1,BECKETT>要是他们能让任何一部分失灵  炸弹就不会爆
<24-1,BECKETT>If they can stop any one of those parts from working, the bomb fails.

154
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,000
<24-2,ERIC>炸弹一定会爆炸  这还没完呢
<24-2,ERIC>It's not gonna fail. I'm not done yet.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,220
<24-3,BECKETT>这事还远远没完
<24-3,BECKETT>None of this is over.

156
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,190
<24-4,ERIC>那你就会以警察杀手的身份重回监狱
<24-4,ERIC>Well, then you're going back to jail a cop killer,

157
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,180
<23-2,CASTLE>还没有哪座监狱...
<23-2,CASTLE>and there's not a prison around that's gonna--

158
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,140
<23-3,BRUNO>你们想救朋友吗  给我找个律师
<23-3,BRUNO>You want to save your friend? I want a lawyer.

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,730
<28-5,MARTHA RODGERS>马上去
<28-5,MARTHA RODGERS>Now.

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,750
<28-6,MARTHA>我们估计触发板大约在三乘三英尺范围内
<28-6,MARTHA>We're estimating the trigger plate is about 3 feet by 3 feet.

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,790
<28-7,CASTLE>别跨过这条线
<28-7,CASTLE>So no one crosses this line.

162
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,050
<28-8,MARTHA>拆除过程一般要多久
<28-8,MARTHA>And the disarming process, how long does that usually take?

163
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,690
<28-9,ALEXIS>要看炸弹了
<28-9,ALEXIS>Well, that depends on the bomb.

164
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,420
<28-10,MARTHA>我们还不清楚这是个怎样的炸弹
<28-10,MARTHA>We still don't know what kind of device we're dealing with.

165
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,240
<28-11,CASTLE>那我们现在要干什么
<28-11,CASTLE>So what are we supposed to do in the meantime,

166
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,710
<28-12,MARTHA>你不能让她就这么站着
<28-12,MARTHA>just--you can't have her just stand there.

167
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,930
<14-7,DAVID ANDERSON>我没事的  卡塞尔
<14-7,DAVID ANDERSON>I'm okay, Castle.

168
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,930
<14-8,ERIC>不  你有事  你正站在...
<14-8,ERIC>No, you're not okay. You're standing...

169
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,570
<14-9,DAVID>你说过  站在触发板上就相当于拉起枪栓
<14-9,DAVID>Look, you said, uh, stepping on the plate was like cocking the hammer.

170
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,870
<14-10,BECKETT>从触发板上下来相当于扣下扳机
<14-10,BECKETT>stepping off the plate was pulling the trigger.

171
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,510
<14-11,DAVID>要是用和贝克特相同重量的东西换下她呢
<14-11,DAVID>What if we replaced Beckett with something of equal weight?

172
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,870
<14-11,DAVID>就好像《夺宝奇兵》里一袋沙换一袋金的把戏
<14-11,DAVID>You know, just the old Indiana Jones bag of sand/golden idol trick.

173
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,600
<14-11,DAVID>记得结局怎样吗
<14-11,DAVID>Remember how that turned out?

174
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,690
<14-11,DAVID>她所站的触发板
<14-11,DAVID>Look, the plate she's standing on can sense

175
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,050
<14-11,DAVID>能探测到轻微的压力波动
<14-11,DAVID>even minor fluctuations in pressure.

176
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,720
<14-11,DAVID>要想偷梁换柱  就会引爆炸弹
<14-11,DAVID>You try to transfer the weight, you'll set off the bomb.

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
<14-11,DAVID>在她身上加任何防护装备  也会引爆炸弹
<14-11,DAVID>Put any kind of protective gear on her, you'll set off the bomb.

178
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,580
<14-11,DAVID>她快速换一条腿...
<14-11,DAVID>She shifts too quickly from one foot to the other--

179
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,470
<14-11,DAVID>还会引爆炸弹  我明白了
<14-11,DAVID>Set off the bomb. I-I get it.

180
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,820
<20-1,CASTLE>谢谢  很抱歉我这么问你
<20-1,CASTLE>Thank you. I'm sorry I asked.

181
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,280
<20-2,BECKETT>那我们该做什么  傻站着吗
<20-2,BECKETT>So what are we supposed to do, just stand here?

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,660
<20-3,CASTLE>你不必站在这里  卡塞尔先生
<20-3,CASTLE>Not you, Mr. Castle.

183
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,010
<20-4,BECKETT>无关人士必须撤离
<20-4,BECKETT>All nonessential personnel must evacuate.

184
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,240
<20-5,CASTLE>不  我关系可大了
<20-5,CASTLE>Oh, no. I am essential personnel.

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,690
<26-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没事的
<26-7,BECKETT>Castle, it's okay.

186
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,800
<26-8,CASTLE>我们会好好照顾她的
<26-8,CASTLE>We'll take good care of her.

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,690
<26-9,BECKETT>我的人就在楼下想对策
<26-9,BECKETT>I got guys downstairs right now figuring this out.

188
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,320
<26-10,CASTLE>与此同时  探长  不要轻举妄动
<26-10,CASTLE>Meantime, detective, sit tight.

189
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,780
<26-11,BECKETT>我很快就回来看你
<26-11,BECKETT>I'll check back with you soon.

190
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,950
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>谢了  我要待在这里
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>I appreciate it. I'm staying.

191
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,770
<28-2,CASTLE>卡塞尔  拜托  没道理让你犯险
<28-2,CASTLE>Castle, please. There is no reason to put yourself in danger.

192
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,590
<28-3,ALEXIS>你也束手无策
<28-3,ALEXIS>There's nothing that you can do here.

193
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,470
<28-4,CASTLE>束手无策  请问谁来做你的炸友
<28-4,CASTLE>Nothing? Excuse me. Who's gonna be your bomb buddy?

194
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,730
<28-5,MARTHA RODGERS>炸友
<28-5,MARTHA RODGERS>My bomb buddy?

195
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,800
<28-6,MARTHA>你也听到他说的话了
<28-6,MARTHA>You heard what he said.

196
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,420
<22-18,ERIC>你可能要在这儿站上好几个小时
<22-18,ERIC>You're gonna be standing here, maybe for hours.

197
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,690
<22-19,BECKETT>我不在的话  谁来鼓励你
<22-19,BECKETT>If I don't stay, who's gonna keep your spirits up?

198
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,120
<22-20,ERIC>谁来给你加油打气
<22-20,ERIC>Who's gonna take your mind off of getting tired?

199
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,380
<22-20,ERIC>卡塞尔  我没事的  我现在很好
<22-20,ERIC>Castle, I'm gonna be fine. I feel fine.

200
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,990
<22-20,ERIC>如果你清楚自己的感受  那听你这么说真是好事
<22-20,ERIC>That would be great if you were a reliable judge of your own feelings,

201
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,730
<22-20,ERIC>但显然  你不清楚
<22-20,ERIC>which clearly, you're not.

202
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,700
<22-20,ERIC>什么意思
<22-20,ERIC>What does that mean?

203
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,960
<22-20,ERIC>不好意思  首先  据你自己所说
<22-20,ERIC>I'm sorry. Exhibit "A"-- according to you,

204
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,040
<22-20,ERIC>我们初遇时你对我毫无感觉
<22-20,ERIC>you felt nothing for me when we first met,

205
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,560
<24-1,BECKETT>-而我们都知道...  -你这是...我明白了
<24-1,BECKETT>- which we both know... - Are you act--oh,I get it.

206
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,400
<24-2,ERIC>-我明白你这是干什么了  -干什么
<24-2,ERIC>- I know what you're doing. - What?

207
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,450
<24-3,BECKETT>你知道吗  卡塞尔  算了吧
<24-3,BECKETT>You know what, Castle? Forget it.

208
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,910
<24-4,ERIC>我不会上套的  你快走吧
<24-4,ERIC>I'm not going down that path. You can just go now.

209
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,500
<24-5,BECKETT>好吧  你承认我们初遇时
<24-5,BECKETT>Fine, I'll leave if you admit to me

210
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,250
<25-4,CASTLE>你就对我有感觉  那我就走
<25-4,CASTLE>you had feelings for me when we first met.

211
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,990
<25-5,ESPOSITO>好吧  我们初遇时我就对你有感觉
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Fine. I did have feelings for you when we first met.

212
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,500
<26-11,BECKETT>特受不了你的感觉
<26-11,BECKETT>I couldn't stand you.

213
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,210
<28-11,CASTLE>你还记得一开始你什么样吗
<28-11,CASTLE>Do you even remember what you were like in the beginning?

214
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,780
<23-6,CASTLE>很明显  我魅力无边
<23-6,CASTLE>Well, apparently, I was irresistible.

215
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,520
<23-7,BRUNO>魅力无边  开什么玩笑
<23-7,BRUNO>Irresistible? Are you joking?

216
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,160
<23-8,ESPOSITO>理查德·卡塞尔  我们以妨碍司法公正将你逮捕
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Richard Castle, you are under arrest for obstruction of justice.

217
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,570
<23-9,BRUNO>你忘记加上让你丢脸这条了
<23-9,BRUNO>You forgot making you look bad.

218
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,290
<23-9,BRUNO>铐上他
<23-9,BRUNO>Cuff him.

219
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,790
<21-1,BECKETT>捆绑啊  我的安全词是"苹果"
<21-1,BECKETT>Bondage. My safe word is "apples".

222
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,260
<7-6,ERIC>猜猜谁刚约了妓女
<7-6,ERIC>Guess who's got a date with a prostitute?

223
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,430
<7-7,BECKETT>好多寂寞的女人靠近我
<7-7,BECKETT>So many lonely women approached me

224

<35-7,ERIC>那得有十万种可能性吗
<35-7,ERIC>That's, what, a hundred thousand combinations?

329
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,680
<31-22,BECKETT>而且它是防干扰的
<31-22,BECKETT>Yeah, and it's tamper proof.

330
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,690
<31-23,CASTLE>如果输错密码
<31-23,CASTLE>Enter the wrong code, and...

331
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,590
<14-3,BECKETT>我的客户说他愿意交出拆除密码  但是
<14-3,BECKETT>My client says that he's willing to give you the disarm code, but...

332
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,910
<32-1,BECKETT>他有些要求
<32-1,BECKETT>He has some demands.

333
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,180
<32-1,BECKETT>完全豁免  开玩笑呢
<32-1,BECKETT>Full amnesty? You gotta be kidding me, right?

334
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,610
<32-1,BECKETT>他昨晚就杀了一个人
<32-1,BECKETT>This guy killed someone last night.

335
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,330
<32-1,BECKETT>无法证实
<32-1,BECKETT>Uh, allegedly killed.

336
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,800
<26-1,ERIC>听我说  我跟他说你们不会同意的
<26-1,ERIC>Look, I know. I-I told him that you wouldn't go for it,

337
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,350
<26-1,ERIC>但如果你还没发现  他精神不太正常
<26-1,ERIC>but if you haven't noticed, he's got a screw loose.

338
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,380
<26-1,ERIC>其他这些我都能满足
<26-1,ERIC>I can work on these other things--

339
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
<26-1,ERIC>食物  衣物  甚至电话也有可能
<26-1,ERIC>Food, clothes, even the phone isn't impossible, but--

340
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,990
<26-1,ERIC>他说他不愿回监狱
<26-1,ERIC>He said he won't go back to prison. Okay?

341
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,350
<25-1,ESPOSITO>让他走  否则他就不帮她
<25-1,ESPOSITO>He walks or he won't help her.

342
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,940
<22-10,ERIC>-你叫博耶  是吗  -对
<22-10,ERIC>- Boyer, right? - Yeah.

343
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,880
<22-11,BECKETT>你法学院毕业多久了  两三年吗
<22-11,BECKETT>You been out of law school, what, two, three years?

344
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,790
<22-12,ERIC>-十个月  -十个月
<22-12,ERIC>- Ten months. - Ten months?

345
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,380
<22-13,BECKETT>-对  -好  听我说
<22-13,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Okay, listen to me.

346
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,490
<22-13,BECKETT>那个站在炸弹上的探长  她不能有事
<22-13,BECKETT>That detective standing on that bomb, she needs to get through this.

347
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,140
<22-13,BECKETT>懂吗
<22-13,BECKETT>You understand me?

348
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,630
<22-13,BECKETT>我发誓  我已经尽力了
<22-13,BECKETT>Look, I-I swear. I'm--I'm doing what I can.

349
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,580
<22-13,BECKETT>好吧  我拿这份清单去找地检官
<22-13,BECKETT>All right. I'll take this list to the D. A.,

350
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,070
<19-1,GATES>但我们得想个备用计划
<19-1,GATES>but we're gonna need a plan "B.

351
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,970
<19-2,CASTLE>地检官不同意  这不能怪他
<19-2,CASTLE>The D. A. 's not going for it, nor should he.

352
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,200
<19-3,BECKETT>为了救一个人而把这个疯子放回社会上
<19-3,BECKETT>Turning this madman loose on society to save a single life,

353
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,590
<19-4,CASTLE>哪怕是为了救她  也有违我们一切的宗旨
<19-4,CASTLE>even hers, is against everything we stand for.

354
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,430
<19-5,BECKETT>贝克特肯定也会这么想的
<19-5,BECKETT>Beckett--she'd be the first to agree with that.

355
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,440
<19-6,GATES>我再去找那个律师
<19-6,GATES>I'll go back to the lawyer.

356
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,830
<15-9,ERIC>看他能不能说动弗希
<15-9,ERIC>See if he can get through to Fosse.

357
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,110
<15-10,PETRA>我告诉他交易是可以的  但是豁免不行
<15-10,PETRA>So I told him that there was a deal to be had, just not for amnesty--

358
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,540
<15-11,BECKETT>-然后呢  -他还是坚持要豁免
<15-11,BECKETT>- And? - And he's still insisting he walk.

359
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,490
<15-11,BECKETT>我想给他几分钟想想  再去劝他
<15-11,BECKETT>I figured I'd give him a few minutes to think and try again.

360
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,520
<15-11,BECKETT>警探  我发誓  我真的尽力了
<15-11,BECKETT>Detective, I swear, I'm doing everything I can.

361

<15-11,BECKETT>-谢谢  -不客气
<15-11,BECKETT>- Thanks. - Yeah.

362
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,610
<15-11,BECKETT>帮我个忙
<15-11,BECKETT>Yo, do me a favor?

363
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,500
<15-11,BECKETT>你能帮我拖住那个小律师一会儿吗
<15-11,BECKETT>Why don't you keep junior over there busy for me, will you?

364
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,270
<23-1,BRUNO>我去探视一下拘留室里那小子
<23-1,BRUNO>I'm gonna go see our boy in holding.

365
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,100
<23-2,CASTLE>干什么
<23-2,CASTLE>Why?

366
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,810
<23-3,BRUNO>你不是想要密码吗
<23-3,BRUNO>You want that code, right?

367
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,570
<16-17,CASTLE>-哈维尔  你要干什么  -那得看他的了
<16-17,CASTLE>- Javi, what are you gonna do? - That's up to him.

368
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,880
<16-18,CASTLE>医务人员  叫一名医务人员来拘留室
<16-18,CASTLE>Medic! I need a medic in holding now!

369
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,620
<16-19,ESPOSITO>他怎么拿到钢笔的
<16-19,ESPOSITO>How in the hell did he get that pen?

370
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,960
<16-20,CASTLE>那个律师给他的
<16-20,CASTLE>That friggin' lawyer gave it to him.

371
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,550
<16-21,CASTLE>他想劝服弗希提出别的要求
<16-21,CASTLE>He was trying to encourage Fosse to come up with some alternate demands.

372
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,080
<16-22,RYAN>可他却害我们失去了拿到拆掉密码的机会
<16-22,RYAN>And instead he just cost us any hope Of getting that disarm code.

373
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,000
<16-23,CASTLE>这家伙几个月前才出狱
<16-23,CASTLE>The guy just got out of prison a couple of months ago.

374
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,110
<16-24,ESPOSITO>他为什么要杀人  又为什么自杀
<16-24,ESPOSITO>Why would he start killing people, and why would he take his own life?

375
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,500
<24-1,BECKETT>我想我知道
<24-1,BECKETT>I think I can answer that.

376
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,240
<24-2,ERIC>我查到弗希是脑癌晚期
<24-2,ERIC>Turns out... Fosse had stage iv brain cancer.

377
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,420
<24-3,BECKETT>他上个月得知的  死亡只是早晚的事了
<24-3,BECKETT>Found out last month. He was gonna die anyway.

378
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,810
<24-4,ERIC>既然要死  那不如拉上敌人一起死
<24-4,ERIC>So if he was dying, why not take his enemies with him?

379
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,880
<24-5,BECKETT>没错  而且他的仇人不只有警察
<24-5,BECKETT>Exactly, and his enemies weren't limited to cops

380
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,530
<24-6,ERIC>和昨晚死于炸弹的被害人
<24-6,ERIC>and last night's bombing victim.

381
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:52,750
<24-7,BECKETT>上周康涅狄格州也发生了一起爆炸
<24-7,BECKETT>There was another bombing last week in Connecticut.

382
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,160
<24-8,ERIC>死者曾为六年前把弗希
<24-8,ERIC>That victim worked for the A. D. A.

383
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,080
<24-9,BECKETT>关进大牢的副地检工作
<24-9,BECKETT>that put Fosse in jail six years ago.

384
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,440
<27-5,ESPOSITO>弗希说过  "这还没完呢"
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, Fosse said, "I'm not done yet.

385
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,740
<27-6,TORY>列出一份他那件案子所有跟控方有关的人
<27-6,TORY>Make a list of everyone involved with the prosecution at his trial.

386
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,230
<27-6,TORY>我们得警告他们  可能还有别的炸弹
<27-6,TORY>We need to warn them. There may be other bombs out there.

387
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,310
<27-6,TORY>并且彻查两起爆炸案中
<27-6,TORY>And get all the information on any fragments

388
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,940
<27-6,TORY>找到的全部碎片的信息
<27-6,TORY>that were recovered from both bombings.

389
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,210
<27-6,TORY>如果两颗炸弹有什么相同的部件
<27-6,TORY>If those bombs were made with any common components,

390
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,210
<26-1,ERIC>或许能帮助拆弹小组解除贝克特踩的炸弹
<26-1,ERIC>it could help B.D.U. deactivate the device that Beckett's on.

391
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,860
<26-1,ERIC>没有解除密码  我们必须看看装置本身
<26-1,ERIC>Without the disarm code, We're gonna need to get eyes on the device.

392
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,830
<26-1,ERIC>我们用光纤探镜  从下面天花板往上看
<26-1,ERIC>We use a fiber-optic scope... Go in through the ceiling downstairs.

393
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,930
<26-1,ERIC>那样危险吗
<26-1,ERIC>Is that dangerous?

394
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,050
<26-1,ERIC>我们会尽可能降低危险
<26-1,ERIC>Well, we'll do everything we can to minimize the risk.

395
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,390
<26-1,ERIC>我们从屋子对面把线申过来
<26-1,ERIC>We'll start across the room, snake the cable over.

396
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,680
<26-1,ERIC>不过  还是会引起一定振动
<26-1,ERIC>Still, there'll be some vibrations.

397
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,140
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>-所以还是有可能  -做你该做的吧
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>- So there's always a chance that - Just do it.

398
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,840
<28-2,CASTLE>我总不能一直站在这儿
<28-2,CASTLE>I can't keep standing here forever.

399
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,900
<28-3,ALEXIS>好的  我们会尽快做完  但是也尽量小心
<28-3,ALEXIS>All right. We'll go as quick as we can but as slow as we have to.

400
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,430
<28-4,CASTLE>谢谢
<28-4,CASTLE>Thank you.

<28-5,MARTHA RODGERS>- Castle, listen to me - I'm not leaving.

402
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,930
<28-6,MARTHA>我知道  但是鉴于目前的情况
<28-6,MARTHA>Look, I know, but depending on what happens,

403
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,930
<28-7,CASTLE>我想要你帮我做件事
<28-7,CASTLE>there's something that I need you to do--

404
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,560
<28-8,MARTHA>我自己做不到的事
<28-8,MARTHA>Something that I can't do myself.

405
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,000
<28-9,ALEXIS>要我帮你藏好黄片不让你爸爸发现吗
<28-9,ALEXIS>You need me to hide your porn stash so your dad doesn't find it?

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,380
<28-10,MARTHA>你别闹了  好吗
<28-10,MARTHA>Could you just be serious for a second, please?

407
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,480
<28-11,CASTLE>好吧  说吧  要我做什么
<28-11,CASTLE>Okay. What? What do you need me to do?

408
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,350
<22-12,ERIC>待会儿再说  但你得答应我你会做到
<22-12,ERIC>Not now, okay? Just promise me you'll do it.

409
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,570
<22-13,BECKETT>好的  没问题
<22-13,BECKETT>Yeah. Okay, yeah.

410
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,200
<22-11,BECKETT>但是  你不用往这方面想的
<22-11,BECKETT>But look, you don't need to be thinking like this.

411
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,860
<22-9,BECKETT>我只是想实际一点  卡塞尔
<22-9,BECKETT>I'm just--I'm trying to be realistic, Castle.

412
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,880
<22-7,ERIC>我都在这儿站了几小时了
<22-7,ERIC>I've been standing here for hours.

413
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,610
<22-5,ERIC>我开始觉得累了
<22-5,ERIC>And I'm feeling the fatigue set in.

414
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,940
<36-4,CASTLE>别去想那个
<36-4,CASTLE>Don't think about it.

415
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,760
<36-5,DAVID>击败疲劳只是
<36-5,DAVID>Beating fatigue is just, um...

416
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,560
<36-6,BECKETT>用心智战胜身体
<36-6,BECKETT>It's mind over body.

417
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,420
<36-7,CASTLE>逃跑的战俘为获得自由能步行数百英里

<38-5,CASTLE>你能说服自己相信一切
<38-5,CASTLE>You can convince yourself of almost anything.

422
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,890
<38-6,BECKETT>就像你让自己相信你没有迷恋我
<38-6,BECKETT>Much like you convinced yourself you weren't crazy about me.

423
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,170
<32-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我知道你这是干什么
<32-1,BECKETT>Castle, I know what you're trying to do.

<32-2,CASTLE>你想让我别去想这个
<32-2,CASTLE>You're trying to take my mind off of it.

<32-3,CINDY>我也很感激  但我们真得要
<32-3,CINDY>And I appreciate that, but do we really have to--

426
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,380
<31-24,BECKETT>对了  你或许能说服你自己  但是
<31-24,BECKETT>And by the way, you may have convinced yourself, but...

427
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,590
<31-25,CASTLE>你骗不了其他人
<31-25,CASTLE>you weren't fooling anyone else--

428
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,660
<31-26,RYAN>骗不过我  更骗不过你的朋友们
<31-26,RYAN>Not me, and certainly not your friends.

429
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,800
<31-27,BECKETT>是吗  因为从没有谁对我说过什么
<31-27,BECKETT>Really? 'cause no one ever said anything to me.

430
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,430
<30-1,BECKETT>还跟姐姐装蒜是吧
<30-1,BECKETT>Girl, I'm gonna smack you.

431
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,870
<26-8,CASTLE>你们每天形影不离地工作
<26-8,CASTLE>You work side by side every day.

432
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,830
<26-9,BECKETT>他以你为蓝本在书中大写性爱场景
<26-9,BECKETT>He writes a sex scene in his book about you

433
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,790
<26-10,CASTLE>看得我都要喝冰水降温
<26-10,CASTLE>that had me reaching for ice water.

434
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,460
<26-11,BECKETT>现在半路杀出来一个新娘旧情人
<26-11,BECKETT>Now little Miss Bride shows up,

435
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,210
<26-12,CASTLE>别告诉我你一点酸劲儿都没有
<26-12,CASTLE>don't tell me you're not the least bit jealous.

436
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,650
<26-13,BECKETT>得了吧  我看你在这里药水味闻太多了
<26-13,BECKETT>Oh, please. You have been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.

437
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,480
<26-14,CASTLE>亲爱的  不识庐山真面目
<26-14,CASTLE>Honey, just because you can't see what's going on

438
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,330
<33-5,BECKETT>只缘身在此山中
<33-5,BECKETT>doesn't mean everyone else doesn't see what's going on.

439
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,870
<26-12,CASTLE>闭嘴
<26-12,CASTLE>Shut up.

440
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,440
<26-13,BECKETT>他喜欢你
<26-13,BECKETT>He's into you,

441
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,180
<27-9,ESPOSITO>你明显也对他有好感  但是你决意
<27-9,ESPOSITO>But you're determined not to give in to these feelings

442
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,630
<27-10,RYAN>不让那种感情影响你
<27-10,RYAN>that you clearly have for him.

443
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,250
<27-11,ESPOSITO>于是他通过写作来抒发对你的幻想
<27-11,ESPOSITO>So he fantasizes about you through his writing.

444
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,440
<27-11,ESPOSITO>这简直就是书面意淫
<27-11,ESPOSITO>It's literally...verbal masturbation.

445
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,210
<24-3,BECKETT>不  我明白
<24-3,BECKETT>No, no, no, no, no. I get it.

446
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,040
<23-2,CASTLE>你为卡塞尔着迷
<23-2,CASTLE>You're hot for Castle.

447
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,260
<23-3,BRUNO>你想为他生小卡塞尔
<23-3,BRUNO>You want to make little Castle babies.

448
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,680
<26-5,BECKETT>不管你怎么掩饰  你迷恋着他
<26-5,BECKETT>Despite your little act, you're crazy about him.

449
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,050
<26-6,CASTLE>怎么  这难不成还是惊天大秘密啊
<26-6,CASTLE>Oh, what? Was that supposed to be some big secret?

450
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,900
<26-7,BECKETT>必须的
<26-7,BECKETT>Yes.

451
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,060
<26-8,CASTLE>好吧
<26-8,CASTLE>No.

452
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,970
<26-9,BECKETT>你觉得他知道吗
<26-9,BECKETT>Do you think he knows?

453
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,590
<26-9,BECKETT>把他完全交给你了
<26-9,BECKETT>He's all yours.

454
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,750
<22-1,ERIC>好吧
<22-1,ERIC>Okay, okay.

455
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,150
<22-2,BECKETT>她们或许说过什么
<22-2,BECKETT>They might have said something, but--

456
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,850
<22-3,ERIC>但他们完全是搞错状况了
<22-3,ERIC>But they were completely misreading the situation.

457
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,590
<22-4,BECKETT>就像你那么多次穿一些暴露的衣服
<22-4,BECKETT>Oh. Much like I must have been misreading the situation

458
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,740
<22-5,ERIC>想要引起我瞩目
<22-5,ERIC>all those times you dressed up in revealing outfits

459
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,690
<22-10,ERIC>也是我自作多情了吗
<22-10,ERIC>to try and, uh, turn my head.

460
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,150
<22-15,ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT>没有人...
<22-15,ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT>"No one"...

461
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
<22-20,ERIC>隐藏身份  我喜欢
<22-20,ERIC>Undercover? I like it.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,970
<23-4,RYAN>不过保险起见  最好再开一颗扣子
<23-4,RYAN>You might want to pop one more button, just in case.

463
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,300
<23-5,BRUNO>这是我的幻觉  还是你真变了
<23-5,BRUNO>Is it just my imagination, or did you change?

464
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,280
<23-6,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  请叫支援好吗  -好的
<23-6,CASTLE>- Castle, could you get some backup, please? - Yeah.

465
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,100
<23-7,BRUNO>我变装都是为了卧底
<23-7,BRUNO>The only reason that I was dressed up was to go undercover.

466
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,400
<23-8,ESPOSITO>那么我每次都在场
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, I guess it was just a coincidence that...

467
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,200
<23-9,BRUNO>就只是个巧合了
<23-9,BRUNO>each time, I just so happened to be there.

468
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
<26-13,BECKETT>不  那不是巧合
<26-13,BECKETT>No, it wasn't a coincidence,

469
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,990
<26-14,CASTLE>是因为你总是跟着我
<26-14,CASTLE>because you were always following me around.

470
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,320
<26-14,CASTLE>为什么呢  因为你喜欢我
<26-14,CASTLE>Why? 'cause you were into me.

471
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,810
<26-14,CASTLE>-我喜欢你  -对
<26-14,CASTLE>- Me into you? - Yeah.

472
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,340
<26-14,CASTLE>我承认  我并没有不被你吸引
<26-14,CASTLE>Mm. I-I admit, I found you not unattractive

473
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,730
<26-14,CASTLE>有时候
<26-14,CASTLE>and occasionally...

474
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,930
<20-1,CASTLE>也觉得你很风趣
<20-1,CASTLE>fun to be around.

475
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,620
<22-11,BECKETT>但是我才没有喜欢你呢
<22-11,BECKETT>But into you? N-mm.

476
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,630
<22-12,ERIC>绝对没有
<22-12,ERIC>No. Definitely not.

477
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,340
<22-13,BECKETT>那好吧  那你为什么跟着我
<22-13,BECKETT>Okay, fine. Then why were you following me around?

478
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,910
<23-1,BRUNO>别说是为了搜集素材
<23-1,BRUNO>And don't say that it was research,

479
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,190
<23-2,CASTLE>因为从来没人相信过这个理由
<23-2,CASTLE>because no one believed that for a second.

480
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,510
<23-3,BRUNO>你真想知道吗
<23-3,BRUNO>You really want to know?

481
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,650
<24-3,BECKETT>那是因为
<24-3,BECKETT>It was because I was...

482
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,650
<24-4,ERIC>扮演警察真是太欢乐了
<24-4,ERIC>having so much fun playing cop.

483
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,880
<24-4,ERIC>发现尸体  太棒了
<24-4,ERIC>Dead body? Yes!

484
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,060
<24-4,ERIC>把枪放下  人渣
<24-4,ERIC>Drop the gun, dirtbag!

485
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,130
<24-4,ERIC>-你叫我什么  -人...人渣
<24-4,ERIC>- What did you call me? - D-dirt-dirtbag.

486
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,070
<24-4,ERIC>太好了
<24-4,ERIC>Boo-yah.

487
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,180
<24-4,ERIC>有没有在逃僵尸的警用代码
<24-4,ERIC>Is there a police code for zombie on the loose?

488
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,670
<24-4,ERIC>我爱死这个案子了
<24-4,ERIC>I love this case.

489
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,350
<24-4,ERIC>秘密  谋杀  赌博
<24-4,ERIC>Secrets, murder, and gambling--

490
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,450
<24-4,ERIC>我钟爱的娱乐活动之三
<24-4,ERIC>Three of my favorite pastimes.

491
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,520
<24-4,ERIC>抓住了
<24-4,ERIC>I got him!

492
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,950
<24-4,ERIC>抓住了
<24-4,ERIC>I got him!

493
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,770
<24-4,ERIC>中了  所以你承认
<24-4,ERIC>Bam! So you admit that it was you

494
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,870
<24-4,ERIC>-是你破坏了怀尔德的公寓  -卡塞尔
<24-4,ERIC>- who vandalized Wilder's apartment? - Castle.

495
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,890
<24-4,ERIC>有时忘了自己不是警察
<24-4,ERIC>I sometimes forget I'm not actually a cop.

497
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,070
<22-5,ERIC>要我再次上演《帅虎猛龙》的戏码吗
<22-5,ERIC>Want me to bust out Jake and the Fatman again?

498
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,090
<22-6,BECKETT>我酝酿这个动作很久了耶
<22-6,BECKETT>I've always wanted to do that!

499
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,110
<22-7,ERIC>放下你的枪  否则 我发誓我要-
<22-7,ERIC>Drop the gun or I swear to God, I'll--

500
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,430
<22-8,ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT>看见了吗
<22-8,ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT>Tell me you saw that!

501
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,670
<22-9,BECKETT>抱歉了
<22-9,BECKETT>Sorry!

502
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:03,890
<24-1,BECKETT>帮个忙
<24-1,BECKETT>Little help?

503
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,940
<25-6,CASTLE>真不可思议
<25-6,CASTLE>That was awesome.

504
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,020
<25-7,RYAN>我是说  显然这很可怕
<25-7,RYAN>I mean, well, obviously, it was horrible, but--

507
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,520
<25-8,CASTLE>把手举起来
<25-8,CASTLE>Put your hands in the air

508
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,350
<25-9,RYAN>最好给我跪在地上
<25-9,RYAN>and get on your knees while you're at it!

509
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,470
<25-10,CASTLE>先生们  如果人生教了我什么道理
<25-10,CASTLE>Gentlemen, if I've learned one thing,

510
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,780
<25-11,GATES>那就是不要让凶案这种小事
<25-11,GATES>it's to not let a little thing like murder

511
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,820
<25-12,RYAN>坏了我们玩乐的兴致
<25-12,RYAN>get in the way of having a good time.

512
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,330
<29-2,BECKETT>你才不是因为这个一直跟着我
<29-2,BECKETT>That's not why you were following me around.

513
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,300
<29-3,RYAN>这是其中之一
<29-3,RYAN>It is, too.

514
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,480
<29-4,ESPOSITO>其他的事情
<29-4,ESPOSITO>And anything else you come up with is...

515
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,540
<30-5,BECKETT>都是你瞎想的
<30-5,BECKETT>strictly a product of your imagination.

516
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,140
<30-6,ERIC>看来咱们两个是解决不了这件事了
<30-6,ERIC>Well, it's obvious that you and I are not gonna resolve this.

517
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,380
<29-3,RYAN>你承认先喜欢我了
<29-3,RYAN>So you concede?

518
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,640
<29-4,ESPOSITO>有没有搞错
<29-4,ESPOSITO>Seriously?

519
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,620
<29-5,BECKETT>-谁先喜欢谁  -对
<29-5,BECKETT>- Who like who first? - That's right.

520
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,030
<27-10,RYAN>谁先喜欢上谁的  我还是卡塞尔
<27-10,RYAN>Who was into whom first, me or Castle?

521
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,550
<27-11,ESPOSITO>你知道我现在忙着救你的命吧
<27-11,ESPOSITO>You do realize that I'm busy trying to save your life?

522
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,610
<27-12,RYAN>你回答就行了
<27-12,RYAN>Just answer the question,

523
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,700
<27-13,ESPOSITO>埃斯波  别怕伤害你的朋友
<27-13,ESPOSITO>Espo, and don't be afraid to hurt his feelings.

524
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,370
<26-6,CASTLE>别忘了我们在我前女友婚礼上办案时
<26-6,CASTLE>And don't forget about how jealous she got that time we worked that case

525
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,520
<26-7,BECKETT>她有多嫉妒
<26-7,BECKETT>at my ex-girlfriend's wedding.

526
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,300
<26-7,BECKETT>也别忘了我和戴明在一起时他有多嫉妒
<26-7,BECKETT>Or how jealous he got when I was with Demming.

527
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,880
<26-7,BECKETT>在那之前  她看到我和我前妻在一起
<26-7,BECKETT>Or before that, how jealous she got about me and my ex-wife.

528
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,740
<26-7,BECKETT>你在和谁打电话
<26-7,BECKETT>Who are you talking to?

529
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,520
<35-1,ERIC>那次你写的性爱场景
<35-1,ERIC>Or how about when you wrote that sex scene...

530
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,400
<28-7,CASTLE>卡塞尔和贝克特
<28-7,CASTLE>It's Castle and Beckett.

531
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,440
<33-1,RYAN>他们好像要撑不住了  听听
<33-1,RYAN>I think they're starting to crack. Check it out.

532
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,200
<12-16,CASTLE>你嫉妒我和萨琳娜·凯耶
<12-16,CASTLE>Or, uh, jealous about me and Serena Kaye,

533
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,750
<12-17,BECKETT>还有中情局的索菲亚
<12-17,BECKETT>or Sophia from the CIA,

534
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,560
<12-18,GATES>和联调局的特工肖
<12-18,GATES>or Agent Shaw from the FBI.

535
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,960
<28-10,MARTHA>的确是撑不住了
<28-10,MARTHA>Yeah, wow. Totally losing it.

536
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,060
<33-8,ESPOSITO>我查了弗希以前袭击用的炸弹残片
<33-8,ESPOSITO>Listen, I ran down the bomb fragments from Fosse's previous attacks.

537
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,120
<33-8,ESPOSITO>他以前用的部件和现在完全不同
<33-8,ESPOSITO>The components he used were completely different.

538
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,210
<30-1,BECKETT>对现在这个炸弹的分析
<30-1,BECKETT>They're not gonna be any help in determining

539
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,590
<30-1,BECKETT>一点用都没有
<30-1,BECKETT>what this third bomb is like.

540
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,720
<30-1,BECKETT>现在就看拆弹小组了
<30-1,BECKETT>So it's up to B.D.U. now.

541
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,760
<30-1,BECKETT>我的天
<30-1,BECKETT>Oh, God.

542
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,610
<32-1,BECKETT>还有定时器
<32-1,BECKETT>There's a timer, too.

543
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,620
<32-2,CASTLE>应该是她踩上触发装置时
<32-2,CASTLE>Seems like the timer was activated

544
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,740
<27-4,TORY>定时器就开始倒数了
<27-4,TORY>when she stepped on that triggering plate.

545
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,170
<27-5,ESPOSITO>还剩多长时间
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Okay. Well, how much time is left?

546
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,560
<30-4,ERIC>30分钟47秒
<30-4,ERIC>30 minutes and 47 seconds.

547
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,950
<15-7,ERIC>好吧
<15-7,ERIC>All right. Um...

548
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,540
<15-8,BECKETT>我们能让它停止吗
<15-8,BECKETT>Can we deactivate it by then?

549
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,560
<15-9,ERIC>我们会尽力的
<15-9,ERIC>We'll try.

550
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,180
<15-10,PETRA>问题是  我们通常处理的东西
<15-10,PETRA>Trouble is, our usual targets--

551
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,210
<15-11,BECKETT>雷管  引爆装置和定时销
<15-11,BECKETT>the fuse, the detonator, the timing pin--

552
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,020
<15-12,ERIC>都在钢板底下
<15-12,ERIC>they're all shielded by a steel plate.

553
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,580
<26-2,BECKETT>总有办法的吧
<26-2,BECKETT>Well, there's gotta be something we can do.

554
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,800
<26-12,CASTLE>我们可以给地板铺上装甲
<26-12,CASTLE>We could line the floor with armor.

555
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,770
<26-1,ERIC>我可以穿上拆弹小组的衣服
<26-1,ERIC>I could just put on one of those "Hurt Locker" suits.

556
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,320
<26-10,CASTLE>然后把她撞飞下来
<26-10,CASTLE>I could tackle her right off of it.

557
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,290
<31-4,CASTLE>卡塞尔  如果那玩意爆炸了
<31-4,CASTLE>Castle, if that thing goes off,

558
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,560
<31-5,RYAN>整栋大楼都保不住
<31-5,RYAN>the whole building's going with it.

559
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,150
<31-6,BECKETT>这世上没有那种衣服
<31-6,BECKETT>There's not a suit in the world that's gonna--

560
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,740
<31-7,RYAN>卡塞尔  怎么了
<31-7,RYAN>Hey, Castle. What's going on?

561
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,170
<31-8,CASTLE>我马上过去
<31-8,CASTLE>Uh, be right there.

562
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,040
<31-9,BECKETT>我保证我会竭尽全力的
<31-9,BECKETT>I promise we'll do all that we can.

563
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,560
<31-10,RYAN>但我劝你要有心理准备
<31-10,RYAN>But I urge you to be realistic--

564
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,420
<25-8,CASTLE>谢谢你  警监  谢谢你
<25-8,CASTLE>Okay, thank you. Captain, thank you.

565
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,930
<25-5,ESPOSITO>他说了什么
<25-5,ESPOSITO>What did he say?

566
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,820
<25-6,CASTLE>好消息  他们把炸弹隔离了
<25-6,CASTLE>Good news. They've isolated the bomb.

567
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,890
<28-9,ALEXIS>正在部署拆弹机器人工作
<28-9,ALEXIS>And they're deploying their bomb disposal robot.

568
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,280
<24-6,ERIC>那是一种先进的人工智能原型机
<24-6,ERIC>It's a new prototype model with advanced A.I.

569
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,750
<27-5,ESPOSITO>模拟实战的时候都成功了
<27-5,ESPOSITO>They've had a lot of success in field simulations. It's...

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,850
<27-6,TORY>怎么了
<27-6,TORY>What?

571
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,350
<27-7,ESPOSITO>机器人原型机
<27-7,ESPOSITO>A prototype robot?

572
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,350
<26-12,CASTLE>我可以看得出你说谎  卡塞尔
<26-12,CASTLE>I can tell when you're lying, Castle.

573
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,270
<26-13,BECKETT>你知道的
<26-13,BECKETT>You know that.

574
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,790
<26-14,CASTLE>就像你说
<26-14,CASTLE>Like when you said that you were...

575
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,660
<31-20,BECKETT>你跟着我是为了扮演警察
<31-20,BECKETT>following me just to play cop.

576
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,030
<31-21,CASTLE>他到底说了什么
<31-21,CASTLE>Now what did he actually say?

577
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,900
<31-22,BECKETT>炸弹上有定时器
<31-22,BECKETT>There's a timer on the bomb.

578
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,680
<31-23,CASTLE>还有多久
<31-23,CASTLE>How long?

579
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,760
<31-24,BECKETT>大概三十分钟
<31-24,BECKETT>About 30 minutes.

580
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,720
<31-25,CASTLE>也无所谓了
<31-25,CASTLE>Yeah, well, it's probably just as well.

581
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,270
<31-26,RYAN>我也快站不住了
<31-26,RYAN>I can't keep standing here anyway.

582
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,030
<23-7,BRUNO>咱们会没事的
<23-7,BRUNO>Hey, we will get you out of this.

583
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,510
<23-8,ESPOSITO>你怎么这么确定
<23-8,ESPOSITO>And what makes you so sure?

584
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,040
<23-9,BRUNO>再糟糕的事我们也遇过啊
<23-9,BRUNO>We've been in bad situations before.

585
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,330
<30-1,BECKETT>现在听我的
<30-1,BECKETT>Now here's what's gonna happen.

586
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,730
<34-2,BECKETT>我们一起慢慢走到电梯那里
<34-2,BECKETT>We're just gonna stroll on over to the elevator, together.

587
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,670
<34-3,CASTLE>你出声  我就对着他的肝来一下
<34-3,CASTLE>You make a sound, and I'll put a round in this man's liver,

588
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,410
<34-4,BECKETT>他会慢慢死去
<34-4,BECKETT>and he will die slowly.

589
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,050
<26-4,CASTLE>你到底想离死亡有多近呢
<26-4,CASTLE>How close to death do you want to get?

590
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,550
<26-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<26-5,BECKETT>Castle!

591
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,750
<26-5,BECKETT>看到了吗
<26-5,BECKETT>Are you watching?

592
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,210
<26-5,BECKETT>你的女人在我手上
<26-5,BECKETT>I got your girl!

593
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,930
<26-5,BECKETT>我觉得  这种情况下
<26-5,BECKETT>I feel, in situations like this,

594
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,470
<26-5,BECKETT>有信念很重要
<26-5,BECKETT>it's important to have faith.

595
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,220
<26-5,BECKETT>救命
<26-5,BECKETT>Help!

596
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,790
<26-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<26-5,BECKETT>Castle!

597
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,060
<26-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<26-5,BECKETT>Castle,

598
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,940
<26-5,BECKETT>谢谢你
<26-5,BECKETT>thank you...

599
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,330
<26-5,BECKETT>陪着我
<26-5,BECKETT>for being there.

600
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,680
<26-5,BECKETT>我一直都在
<26-5,BECKETT>Always.

601
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,500
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>是的  我们似乎
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Yeah, there is something about us

602
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,620
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>有卷入麻烦的体质
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>that seems to draw in trouble.

603
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,170
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>但你忘了最惊魂的那次
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>But you're forgetting the scariest one of them all.

604
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,820
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>理查德  我回来了
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Richard, I'm home!

605
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,290
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>我的天
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Oh, my god. Aah!

606
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,630
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>儿子  我们得谈谈
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Darling, we need to talk.

607
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,600
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>躲起来
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Hide.

608
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,090
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>-什么  -躲起来
<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>What? Hide.

609
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,600
<34-1,CASTLE>-你说真的吗  -躲到衣橱里
<34-1,CASTLE>- Are you serious? - Get in the closet.

610
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,830
<34-2,BECKETT>不  我才不躲到衣橱里呢
<34-2,BECKETT>No, I'm not going in the closet.

611
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,080
<26-7,BECKETT>快躲到衣橱里
<26-7,BECKETT>Get in the closet.

612
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,280
<26-8,CASTLE>出什么事了
<26-8,CASTLE>What's going on?

613
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,410
<26-9,BECKETT>我只是...
<26-9,BECKETT>I'm just...

614
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,930
<26-10,CASTLE>在铺床
<26-10,CASTLE>making the bed.

615
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,060
<22-10,ERIC>真是吓死人了
<22-10,ERIC>That was terrifying.

616
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,580
<22-11,BECKETT>但是  尽管
<22-11,BECKETT>But still,

617
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,290
<22-12,ERIC>局面糟糕透顶  我们总会解决办法
<22-12,ERIC>as bad as the situation gets, we always find a way out.

618
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,180
<22-13,BECKETT>好吧
<22-13,BECKETT>Okay, fine.

619
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,010
<22-13,BECKETT>那这次又该怎么解决呢
<22-13,BECKETT>So how are we gonna find our way out of this one?

620
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,140
<25-1,ESPOSITO>我觉得答案就在弗希的故事里
<25-1,ESPOSITO>I keep thinking the answer is in Fosse's story.

621
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,530
<25-2,GATES>他肯定是因为什么事气疯了  但是什么事呢
<25-2,GATES>I mean, something must have set him off. But what?

622
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,400
<13-7,RYAN>卡塞尔  他的故事有什么重要的呢
<13-7,RYAN>Castle, why does his story matter?

623
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
<13-8,ESPOSITO>故事总是至关重要的
<13-8,ESPOSITO>The story always matters.

624
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,110
<13-9,CASTLE>这就是我们合拍的原因
<13-9,CASTLE>That's actually why we make such a great team.

625
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,200
<13-10,RYAN>你追查证据
<13-10,RYAN>You find the evidence,

626
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,980
<13-10,RYAN>证据助我构架故事
<13-10,RYAN>evidence helps me build a story,

627
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,720
<19-1,GATES>故事指引我们找到答案
<19-1,GATES>the story points us to the solution.

628
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,910
<19-2,CASTLE>房卡
<19-2,CASTLE>The key card.

629
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,510
<19-3,BECKETT>迈克的房卡
<19-3,BECKETT>Mike's key card!

630
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,430
<30-4,ERIC>是斯嘉丽给他的
<30-4,ERIC>Scarlett gave it to him

631
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,410
<30-5,BECKETT>这样他们才能一起打理生意
<30-5,BECKETT>so that the two of them could go into business together.

632
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,300
<30-6,ERIC>这让勒索者很生气
<30-6,ERIC>Making for one angry blackmailer.

633
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,080
<19-8,GATES>他对达尔来说就是个威胁
<19-8,GATES>And as long as he's alive, he's a threat to Dahl.

634
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,550
<13-17,CASTLE>从一开始  她就在计划这一切
<13-17,CASTLE>She was in on it from the start.

635
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,070
<27-4,TORY>是的  你怎么知道
<27-4,TORY>Yes. How did you know?

636
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,690
<27-5,ESPOSITO>心有灵犀
<27-5,ESPOSITO>I was thinking the exact same thing.

637
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,870
<27-6,TORY>我知道扎尔曼要杀害的目标了
<27-6,TORY>I think I figured out who Zalman was paid to kill.

638
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,060
<27-7,ESPOSITO>亿万富翁慈善家克里斯琴·达尔
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Billionaire philanthropist Christian Dahl?

639
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,790
<27-8,TORY>咱俩就像一对双胞胎
<27-8,TORY>It's like we could be twins.

640
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,500
<18-5,ESPOSITO>我想我知道凶手是谁了
<18-5,ESPOSITO>I think I know who the killer is.

641
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,880
<31-12,RYAN>他  什么
<31-12,RYAN>Him. What?

642

<30-11,BECKETT>If Fosse set the bomb for the cops, why not--

814
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,470
<30-12,ERIC>为什么不埋在门口好让他们一进来就踩到呢
<30-12,ERIC>Why not set it by the door so they'd hit is as they came in?

815
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,110
<22-13,BECKETT>除非  这不是给警察的
<22-13,BECKETT>Unless-- this wasn't for cops.

816

<22-16,BECKETT>迪亚哥  他当时要来这里
<22-16,BECKETT>Diego. He was on his way up here.

819
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,930
<33-9,BECKETT>或许弗希打算要挟他以获得信息
<33-9,BECKETT>Maybe Fosse was trying to leverage him for information.

820
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,860
<33-10,CASTLE>好  太棒了

<15-5,PETRA>你觉得弗希想让迪亚哥查什么东西吗
<15-5,PETRA>Do you think Fosse wanted Diego to look something up?

827
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,120
<15-6,BECKETT>也许  但会是什么呢

<28-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Okay, but how is this Diego Jiminez

<28-2,CASTLE>-找到她呢  -不知道
<28-2,CASTLE>- supposed to help find her? - Don't know.

853
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,380
<28-2,CASTLE>他在NYSED工作
<28-2,CASTLE>He worked at the N.Y.S.E.D.

<29-1,RYAN>纽约州教育部
<29-1,RYAN>New York State Education Department.

<29-1,RYAN>等下
<29-1,RYAN>Wait.

856
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,080
<29-1,RYAN>头两个被害人与弗希女友有联系吗
<29-1,RYAN>Were the first two victims related to Fosse's girlfriend?

857
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,580
<29-1,RYAN>有  昨天被杀的女人是弗希女友的表亲
<29-1,RYAN>Yeah, the woman he killed last night was the girlfriend's cousin.

858
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,610
<23-1,BRUNO>第一个被害人在检察院工作
<23-1,BRUNO>And the first victim worked for the D.A.'s office.

859
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,580
<23-2,CASTLE>-他们帮忙转移了她  -弗希不想复仇
<23-2,CASTLE>- They helped relocate her. - Fosse didn't want revenge.

860
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,470
<26-2,BECKETT>他想从他们那得到想要的讯息
<26-2,BECKETT>He was looking for information from them.

861
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,440
<26-3,BECKETT>他想知道女友的新身份
<26-3,BECKETT>He wanted to find out his girlfriend's new identity.

862
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,890
<26-4,CASTLE>他迫切地想要找出线索
<26-4,CASTLE>He was desperate to find them.

863
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,630
<26-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<26-5,BECKETT>Castle.

864
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,310
<32-10,CASTLE>我知道  她有孩子吗
<32-10,CASTLE>Right there with you. Does she have a kid?

865
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,850
<32-11,CINDY>是的  她在审讯后八个月分娩
<32-11,CINDY>Yeah. She gave birth eight months after the trial.

866
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,750
<32-12,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<32-12,BECKETT>How did you know?

867
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,130
<27-14,RYAN>是弗希的  他出狱后才知道
<27-14,RYAN>It's his. He didn't find out about it until he got out.

868
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,890
<33-1,RYAN>所以他把迪亚哥引到这里
<33-1,RYAN>And that's why he lured Diego here.

869
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,040
<33-2,BECKETT>迪亚哥能够查阅州内学校的学生资料
<33-2,BECKETT>Diego had access to state school records.

870
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,470
<33-3,CASTLE>他想找到他的孩子  一切都是为了找到
<33-3,CASTLE>He was trying to find his kid. It was all about fi--

871
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,830
<33-4,RYAN>那就是密码
<33-4,RYAN>That's the code.

872
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,410
<33-5,BECKETT>一定是
<33-5,BECKETT>It has to be.

873
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,060
<30-2,ERIC>莱恩  看看你能不能找到孩子的名字
<30-2,ERIC>Ryan, see if you can find the kid's name.

874
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,780
<30-3,BECKETT>正在找
<30-3,BECKETT>Working on it.

875
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,440
<30-4,ERIC>快点  兄弟  我们还有两分钟
<30-4,ERIC>Okay, work fast, buddy. We got two minutes.

876
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,380
<30-6,ERIC>这个理论合情合理
<30-6,ERIC>It's a story that makes sense.

877
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,780
<30-8,ERIC>弗希想在死前见见自己的骨肉
<30-8,ERIC>Fosse was desperate to see his kid just once before he dies,

878
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,940
<30-10,ERIC>但是母亲把孩子藏起来了
<30-10,ERIC>but the mother has hidden the child away.

879
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,280
<30-5,BECKETT>于是弗希抓狂了
<30-5,BECKETT>So Fosse lashed out,

880
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,470
<33-1,RYAN>不惜一切想要找到他们
<33-1,RYAN>doing whatever it took to track them down.

881
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,990
<31-14,RYAN>我就说我们解决这事
<31-14,RYAN>Told you we'd figure this out.

<31-16,RYAN>-你得离开这  -还不行
<31-16,RYAN>- You've gotta go. - Not yet.

884
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,390
<31-17,CASTLE>求你了  如果他找到名字  我自己输入
<31-17,CASTLE>Please. If he finds the name, I'll type it in myself.

885
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,560
<31-18,CASTLE>-如果没找  -他会找到的
<31-18,CASTLE>- If not-- - He'll come through.

<26-3,BECKETT>孩子的名字叫威廉
<26-3,BECKETT>The kid's name is William.

892
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,360
<26-6,CASTLE>哪个白痴妈妈会给孩子起名叫威力
<26-6,CASTLE>What kind of mother is gonna call her kid willy

893
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,440
<26-6,CASTLE>除非她希望自己的孩子在学校天天被欺负
<26-6,CASTLE>unless she wants his ass kicked every day at the playground?

<25-13,CASTLE>Just kiss the man.

913
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,330
<25-13,CASTLE>长官  你知道
<25-13,CASTLE>Sir, you know?

914
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,830
<25-13,CASTLE>怎么
<25-13,CASTLE>What...

915
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,320
<26-1,ERIC>你以为我是白痴吗
<26-1,ERIC>Do you think I'm an idiot?

916
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,730
<26-2,BECKETT>我需要保持可信的推诿
<26-2,BECKETT>I needed to maintain plausible deniability,

917
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,270
<26-3,BECKETT>只要你们
<26-3,BECKETT>which I can continue

<22-2,BECKETT>我是可以
<22-2,BECKETT>I know I can.

920
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,870
<22-3,ERIC>但是  警监  她经常在工作时
<22-3,ERIC>But, Captain, she has a long history

921
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:00,950
<22-4,BECKETT>对我动手动脚
<22-4,BECKETT>of coming on to me at work--

922
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,400
<19-12,BECKETT>放心  长官  那不会构成任何问题
<19-12,BECKETT>I don't think it'll be a problem, sir.

<19-7,CASTLE>很好
<19-7,CASTLE>Good.

924
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,650
<19-8,GATES>与此同时  既然我们达成共识
<19-8,GATES>Meanwhile, as long as we're on neutral ground here,

925
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,660
<19-9,CASTLE>我得说  他值得
<19-9,CASTLE>I'd say, uh, he's deserves it.

926
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,590
<19-11,GATES>不是吗
<19-11,GATES>Wouldn't you?

927
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,030
<19-12,BECKETT>是的  长官
<19-12,BECKETT>Yes, sir, I would.

928
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,740
<19-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我站在那
<19-12,BECKETT>You know, Castle, when I was standing up there,

929
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,260
<19-12,BECKETT>一直在想我们无数次的亲吻
<19-12,BECKETT>I kept thinking about all the times we've kissed.

930
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,120
<19-12,BECKETT>我在选择最棒的一次
<19-12,BECKETT>And I was trying to decide on the best one.

931
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,930
<19-12,BECKETT>然后呢
<19-12,BECKETT>And what do you think?

932
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,080
<19-12,BECKETT>我觉得我们才刚刚开始
<19-12,BECKETT>I think we're just getting started.
