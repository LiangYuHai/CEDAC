<1-2,KATE BECKETT>没关系  长官  您很忙
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>Not a problem, sir. You're a busy man.

11
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,560
<1-3,FREEDMAN>这话应该对司法部长说
<1-3,FREEDMAN>Tell that to the Attorney General.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,870
<1-3,FREEDMAN>他刚刚添了第一个孙子
<1-3,FREEDMAN>He just had his first grandchild.

13
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,610
<1-3,FREEDMAN>正向我炫耀照片呢
<1-3,FREEDMAN>Now he wants to show me pictures.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,920
<1-3,FREEDMAN>斯塔克探员对你赞誉有加
<1-3,FREEDMAN>So Agent Stack spoke very highly of you.

<1-3,FREEDMAN>聪明  顽强
<1-3,FREEDMAN>Smart, tenacious,

<1-3,FREEDMAN>Said you were a good candidate for the opening

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,560
<1-3,FREEDMAN>特别调查员的优秀人选
<1-3,FREEDMAN>on the A.G. Investigative team.

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,440
<1-4,BECKETT>我很感谢他的信任  长官
<1-4,BECKETT>Well, I appreciate his confidence, sir.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,110
<1-5,FREEDMAN>你不这样想吗
<1-5,FREEDMAN>You don't agree?

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,530
<1-5,FREEDMAN>不  长官  只是
<1-5,FREEDMAN>No, sir. It's just that, um...

22
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,740
<1-6,BECKETT>我是凶案组探长
<1-6,BECKETT>Well, I'm-- I'm a homicide detective.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,070
<1-6,BECKETT>我没有联邦案件的经验
<1-6,BECKETT>I-I don't have any federal experience.

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,000
<1-7,FREEDMAN>司法部长不需要有联邦案件经验的人
<1-7,FREEDMAN>The Attorney General's not looking for federal experience.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,610
<1-7,FREEDMAN>他要的是能完成任务的人
<1-7,FREEDMAN>He wants people who can get the job done.

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,760
<1-7,FREEDMAN>据我看到的资料
<1-7,FREEDMAN>And from everything I've read,

27
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,830
<1-7,FREEDMAN>你就有这能力
<1-7,FREEDMAN>that might be you.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,420
<1-8,BECKETT>多谢谬赞  长官
<1-8,BECKETT>Well, that's very kind of you, sir.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,900
<1-8,BECKETT>这不是谬赞
<1-8,BECKETT>It's not kind.

30
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,070
<1-9,FREEDMAN>你也是这样认为的
<1-9,FREEDMAN>It's what you believe to be true,

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,390
<1-9,FREEDMAN>不是吗
<1-9,FREEDMAN>isn't it?

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,790
<1-9,FREEDMAN>所以你今早才会坐飞机来
<1-9,FREEDMAN>It's why you got on the plane this morning,

33
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,700
<1-9,FREEDMAN>因为考虑到你的背景
<1-9,FREEDMAN>because given your background,

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,540
<1-9,FREEDMAN>你的资历  你的工作成绩
<1-9,FREEDMAN>your qualifications, and your track record,

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,220
<1-9,FREEDMAN>你知道你有更光明的前途
<1-9,FREEDMAN>you know that you're headed for bigger things.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,220
<1-9,FREEDMAN>你也知道  这样的机会
<1-9,FREEDMAN>Just like you know that opportunities like this

37
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,700
<1-9,FREEDMAN>一辈子只有一两次
<1-9,FREEDMAN>come along once, maybe twice in a lifetime.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,400
<1-9,FREEDMAN>但如果你不是这么认为的
<1-9,FREEDMAN>But if that's not what you believe,

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,170
<1-9,FREEDMAN>如果你觉得你只是个凶案组警察
<1-9,FREEDMAN>if you think that you're just a homicide cop...

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,250
<1-9,FREEDMAN>门就在那边
<1-9,FREEDMAN>door's right over there.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,820
<1-10,BECKETT>不  长官  我知道我为什么来这里
<1-10,BECKETT>No, sir. I know why I'm here.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,170
<1-11,FREEDMAN>请坐
<1-11,FREEDMAN>Well, take a seat.

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,020
<1-11,FREEDMAN>我们开始吧
<1-11,FREEDMAN>Let's get started.

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,380
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸  我们要谈谈
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad, we need to talk.

45
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,200
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>你更喜欢哪一个
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Which of these do you like better?

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,560
<2-3,ALEXIS>爸  我是认真的
<2-3,ALEXIS>Dad, I'm serious.

47
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,430
<2-4,CASTLE>我喜欢绿色的  但看起来像是
<2-4,CASTLE>I like the green one, but it kind of looks like

48
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,430
<2-4,CASTLE>巨型绿色蜥蜴在攻击城市
<2-4,CASTLE>a giant green lizard is attacking the city,

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,140
<2-4,CASTLE>这样很酷  但书里内容不是这个
<2-4,CASTLE>which is cool, but it's not what the book is about.

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,250
<2-4,CASTLE>要么我重写  把巨型蜥蜴写进去
<2-4,CASTLE>So I either rewrite the book to make it about a giant lizard

51
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,040
<2-5,ALEXIS>-或者  -爸
<2-5,ALEXIS>- Or-- - Dad.

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,180
<2-6,CASTLE>用洋红色  你是对的
<2-6,CASTLE>Magenta. You're right.

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,540
<2-6,CASTLE>经典  酷  符合故事风格
<2-6,CASTLE>It's classic, it's cool, it tells the story--

54
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,820
<2-7,ALEXIS>爸
<2-7,ALEXIS>Dad.

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,220
<2-8,CASTLE>-什么  -兰考斯基教授依然没收到
<2-8,CASTLE>- What? - Professor Rankowsky still hasn't received

56
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,410
<2-9,ALEXIS>我去哥斯达黎加的费用支票
<2-9,ALEXIS>the check for my Costa Rica trip.

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,180
<2-10,CASTLE>没有吗  真奇怪
<2-10,CASTLE>He didn't? That's so weird.

58
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,570
<2-11,ALEXIS>你没有寄给他  对吗
<2-11,ALEXIS>You didn't send it, did you?

59
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,270
<2-12,CASTLE>你为什么要去研究雨林
<2-12,CASTLE>I'd--why--just why do you want to go study the rain forest

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,420
<2-12,CASTLE>六个星期
<2-12,CASTLE>for six weeks anyway?

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,740
<2-13,ALEXIS>爸  我们说过了
<2-13,ALEXIS>Dad, we talked about this.

62
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,750
<2-14,CASTLE>我知道  但你会待在
<2-14,CASTLE>I know, but you're gonna be staying

63
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,380
<2-14,CASTLE>丛林深处
<2-14,CASTLE>in the middle of a jungle,

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,240
<2-14,CASTLE>距离最近的电话有几英里
<2-14,CASTLE>miles away from the nearest phone,

65
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,570
<2-14,CASTLE>距离最近的医院有几小时车程
<2-14,CASTLE>hours from the nearest hospital.

66
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,350
<2-14,CASTLE>你可能会被毒蜘蛛咬
<2-14,CASTLE>You could be bitten by a poisonous spider

67
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,860
<2-14,CASTLE>或是毒蛇咬
<2-14,CASTLE>or a poisonous snake.

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,740
<2-14,CASTLE>我查过了
<2-14,CASTLE>I looked it up.

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,070
<2-14,CASTLE>这个季节  巨嘴鸟特别具有攻击性
<2-14,CASTLE>Toucans are extremely aggressive this time of year.

70
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,050
<2-15,ALEXIS>是因为巴黎的事吗
<2-15,ALEXIS>Is this about Paris?

71
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,490
<2-16,CASTLE>鉴于最近发生的事
<2-16,CASTLE>I will admit to being...

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,280
<2-16,CASTLE>我的确稍稍有点保护过度了
<2-16,CASTLE>slightly overprotective in light of recent events.

73
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,940
<2-17,ALEXIS>爸  我不能因为那件事就不过日子了
<2-17,ALEXIS>Dad, I can't stop living my life because of what happened.

74
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,110
<2-17,ALEXIS>对  我依然做噩梦
<2-17,ALEXIS>And, yeah, I still have nightmares,

75
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,560
<2-17,ALEXIS>但这正是我想去的原因之一
<2-17,ALEXIS>but that's one of the reasons I want to go.

76
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,050
<2-17,ALEXIS>我不想输给恐惧
<2-17,ALEXIS>I don't want to let fear win.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,400
<2-17,ALEXIS>不
<2-17,ALEXIS>No.

78
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,180
<2-18,CASTLE>当然  你是对的
<2-18,CASTLE>No, of course. You're right. I'll...

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,820
<2-18,CASTLE>我会写支票
<2-18,CASTLE>I'll write the check.

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,930
<2-18,CASTLE>但我不会停止担心你
<2-18,CASTLE>But it's not gonna stop me from worrying about you

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,940
<2-18,CASTLE>或是想你
<2-18,CASTLE>or missing you.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,390
<2-19,ALEXIS>我不希望你停止
<2-19,ALEXIS>And I wouldn't want you to.

83
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,960
<2-19,ALEXIS>只是六周而已
<2-19,ALEXIS>But it's only six weeks.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,270
<2-19,ALEXIS>我又不是要永远离开了
<2-19,ALEXIS>It's not like I'm going away forever.

85
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,620
<2-20,CASTLE>不  但看起来有人永远离开了
<2-20,CASTLE>No, but it sounds like someone has.

86
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,340
<3-1,CASTLE>你好
<3-1,CASTLE>Good to see ya.

<3-4,CASTLE>Where's Beckett?

89
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,990
<3-5,ESPOSITO>我怎么会知道
<3-5,ESPOSITO>How the hell should I know?

90
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,730
<3-5,ESPOSITO>你们不是都同居了吗
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Aren't you two practically living together now?

91

<3-6,CASTLE>她有几天没来我家
<3-6,CASTLE>Ah, well, she left me alone for a couple of days

152
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,010
<5-3,ZIFF>好像是德州人  从卢博克来的

<5-6,ZIFF>She wasn't a prostitute. Why you gotta say that?

158
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,300
<5-7,WOMAN>因为这是事实
<5-7,WOMAN>Because it's true.

159

<5-7,WOMAN>你看她穿着打扮

<5-19,ESPOSITO>怪就怪在这儿  没有一个指纹
<5-19,ESPOSITO>It's what they didn't find. There were no prints.

177
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
<5-19,ESPOSITO>好像整个地方都被擦干净了
<5-19,ESPOSITO>It's like the place has been wiped down.

178
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,480
<5-20,CASTLE>凶手肯定回过房间
<5-20,CASTLE>The killer must have come back to the room

179
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,700
<5-20,CASTLE>清理了痕迹
<5-20,CASTLE>to get rid of the evidence.

180
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,600
<5-21,BECKETT>好  去排查一下
<5-21,BECKETT>All right, set up a canvass.

181
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,800
<5-21,BECKETT>看有没人进出过她的房间
<5-21,BECKETT>See if anyone else entered or exited that room.

182
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,500
<5-21,BECKETT>把电梯里的监控录像
<5-21,BECKETT>And, uh, let's pull surveillance footage

183
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,040
<5-21,BECKETT>拿来看看
<5-21,BECKETT>from the security cam in the elevator.

184
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
<5-21,BECKETT>-也许能看到她和谁一起  -这就去办
<5-21,BECKETT>- Maybe it'll tell us who she was with. - Right on.

185
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,000
<6-1,CASTLE>哪怕不是畅销侦探小说作家
<6-1,CASTLE>It doesn't take a best-selling mystery writer

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,270
<6-1,CASTLE>也能猜到事实
<6-1,CASTLE>to figure this one out.

187
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,300
<6-1,CASTLE>小镇女孩怀揣美梦进城

<6-1,CASTLE>ends up turning tricks to survive.

189
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,160
<6-1,CASTLE>是个悲剧  但这事太常见了
<6-1,CASTLE>It's a tragic, yet all-too-familiar tale.

190
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,230
<6-2,RYAN>但是
<6-2,RYAN>Except...

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,580
<6-2,RYAN>她根本不是那么回事
<6-2,RYAN>That's not this girl's story.

192
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,030
<6-2,RYAN>我们用被害人的指纹查到了她的身份
<6-2,RYAN>We just got a fingerprint match off the victim's body.

193
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,530
<6-2,RYAN>她不叫克里斯托·斯凯
<6-2,RYAN>Uh, her name's not Crystal Sky.

194
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,320
<6-2,RYAN>也绝对不是德州卢博克人
<6-2,RYAN>She's definitely not from Lubbock, Texas.

<6-5,BECKETT>哈佛高材生在贫民窟做妓女
<6-5,BECKETT>Our skid-row hooker is a Harvard honors student?

199
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,160
<6-6,CASTLE>还是那句话  悲剧  但这事太不常见了
<6-6,CASTLE>Like I said, a tragic, yet not-so-familiar tale.

209
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,840
<5-8,CASTLE>这不可能啊
<5-8,CASTLE>This makes no sense.

<5-9,MARTIN TILLAGE>She was supposed to be in Europe

<7-3,BECKETT>Did she have any problems with... drugs or money?

220

<7-3,BECKETT>艾丽卡绝不会吸毒
<7-3,BECKETT>Erika would never use drugs,

221
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,970

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,350
<8-1,CASTLE>结果沦落到在三流旅馆做妓女
<8-1,CASTLE>turns into a hooker in a ratty hotel.

234
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,250
<8-1,CASTLE>这下我绝不准阿丽克西斯去哥斯达黎加了
<8-1,CASTLE>There is no way I'm letting Alexis go to Costa Rica now.

235
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,970
<8-2,BECKETT>她可能是在完美形象压力下崩溃了
<8-2,BECKETT>Maybe she broke under the pressure of being perfect

236
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,780
<8-2,BECKETT>也可能是决定
<8-2,BECKETT>or maybe she just decided

237
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,220
<8-2,BECKETT>做个改变
<8-2,BECKETT>she needed a change.

238
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,420
<8-3,CASTLE>高材生一周之内变妓女
<8-3,CASTLE>Honors student to prostitute in less than a week?

239
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,160
<8-3,CASTLE>这改变也太大了吧
<8-3,CASTLE>That's quite a change.

240
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,480
<8-4,BECKETT>是啊  说不通
<8-4,BECKETT>Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.

241
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,100
<8-5,CASTLE>对了  你今早上去哪了
<8-5,CASTLE>Mm. Hey, where were you this morning?

242
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,740
<8-6,BECKETT>怎么了
<8-6,BECKETT>What do you mean?

243
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,750
<8-7,CASTLE>我打了好几次给你
<8-7,CASTLE>Just called you, a bunch of times.

244
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,950
<8-8,BECKETT>肯定是手机没电了
<8-8,BECKETT>Uh, my phone must have been off.

245
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,790
<8-9,CASTLE>伙计们
<8-9,CASTLE>Hey, guys.

246
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,230
<8-10,ESPOSITO>来看看这个
<8-10,ESPOSITO>Come check this out.

247
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,170
<9-1,ESPOSITO>艾丽卡遇害当晚  晚上11点
<9-1,ESPOSITO>11:00 p.m. The night Erika died.

248
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,640
<9-1,ESPOSITO>她坐电梯到楼下的洗衣房
<9-1,ESPOSITO>She takes the elevator down to the laundry room.

249
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,430
<9-1,ESPOSITO>这是11点05分
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Now this is 11:05.

250
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,070
<9-1,ESPOSITO>她坐电梯回房间
<9-1,ESPOSITO>She takes the elevator back up to her room.

251
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,580
<9-2,CASTLE>看起来很正常啊
<9-2,CASTLE>Seems perfectly normal.

252
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,280
<9-3,ESPOSITO>是的  但你看
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but watch.

253
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,240
<9-3,ESPOSITO>这是午夜刚过
<9-3,ESPOSITO>This is just after midnight.

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,370
<9-3,ESPOSITO>她坐电梯上到楼顶
<9-3,ESPOSITO>She takes the elevator up to the top floor,

255
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,330
<9-3,ESPOSITO>独自一人  但你注意看她到楼顶后的情形
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Alone, but watch what happens when she gets there.

256
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,750
<9-4,BECKETT>她似乎是在确认没人看到她
<9-4,BECKETT>It looks like she's making sure no one sees her.

257
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,690
<9-5,ESPOSITO>或者是跟踪她  但就这么多了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Or following her. But that's it.

258
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,900
<9-5,ESPOSITO>她再没回来
<9-5,ESPOSITO>She doesn't come back down.

259
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,500
<9-5,ESPOSITO>凌晨4点前也没别人上天台
<9-5,ESPOSITO>And no one goes back up there until 4:00 a.m.

260
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,570
<9-6,CASTLE>在那之前呢
<9-6,CASTLE>What about earlier?

261
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,670
<9-7,ESPOSITO>也没有  最后一个上楼顶的人
<9-7,ESPOSITO>No. The last person to go up to the top floor

262
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,700
<9-7,ESPOSITO>也是旅馆客人  一小时前上去的
<9-7,ESPOSITO>was another hotel guest an hour earlier,

263
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,640
<9-7,ESPOSITO>但那人已经八十岁了
<9-7,ESPOSITO>but the guy's 80 years old.

264
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,540
<9-7,ESPOSITO>不可能扛着尸体爬上水塔
<9-7,ESPOSITO>There's no way he's climbing a water tower with a body.

265
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,740
<9-8,BECKETT>看来凶手是走楼梯上天台的
<9-8,BECKETT>Sounds like whoever killed her used the stairs.

266
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,030
<9-9,RYAN>她的手机最近都没用过
<9-9,RYAN>Hey. So... No recent activity on her phone.

267
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,410
<9-9,RYAN>由于她本来要去欧洲
<9-9,RYAN>She left it with her parents

268
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,280
<9-9,RYAN>所以把手机留在父母那了
<9-9,RYAN>since she was supposed to be in Europe.

269
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,740
<9-9,RYAN>不过来看这个
<9-9,RYAN>But, um, check this out.

270
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,740
<9-10,BECKETT>信用卡费用
<9-10,BECKETT>Credit card charge?

271
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,170
<9-11,RYAN>是的  就在两天前
<9-11,RYAN>Yeah, from two days ago.

272
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,780
<9-11,RYAN>这是她入住旅馆之后唯一一笔支出
<9-11,RYAN>It's her only transaction since checking in to the hotel.

273
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,900
<9-11,RYAN>马格
<9-11,RYAN>Margo's.

274
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,880
<9-12,CASTLE>是市中心一家饭店  挺贵的
<9-12,CASTLE>That's a restaurant in midtown. It's expensive.

275
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
<9-13,RYAN>是的  而且她不是一个人
<9-13,RYAN>Yeah, and she wasn't alone.

276
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,560
<9-13,RYAN>看来她和一个叫塔利亚·麦克提的人一起付的账
<9-13,RYAN>Turns out she split the check with a Talia McTeague.

277
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,040
<9-14,BECKETT>查一下这人  也许她那里有答案
<9-14,BECKETT>Okay, run her down. Maybe she can give us some answers.

278
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,630
<9-14,BECKETT>排查有线索吗
<9-14,BECKETT>Uh, is there anything on the canvass?

279
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,790
<9-15,RYAN>没什么有用的
<9-15,RYAN>Nothing useful.

280
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,160
<9-15,RYAN>旅馆的住客都说
<9-15,RYAN>None of the occupants of the hotel

281
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,710
<9-15,RYAN>没见过有人出入她的房间
<9-15,RYAN>admit to seeing anyone going in and out of her hotel room.

282
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,380
<9-15,RYAN>不过就他们晚上听到的她房里那些声音
<9-15,RYAN>But given what they heard coming from her room at night,

283
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,150
<9-15,RYAN>很明显她是个妓女
<9-15,RYAN>it's pretty clear she was a prostitute.

284
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,390
<10-1,LANIE>她要是个妓女  那技术可真不怎么样
<10-1,LANIE>If she was a prostitute, she wasn't very good at it.

285
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,340
<10-2,CASTLE>真的假的
<10-2,CASTLE>Seriously?

286
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,460
<10-2,CASTLE>这你都知道
<10-2,CASTLE>You can tell that?

287
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,920
<10-3,LANIE>卖淫通常就要做爱
<10-3,LANIE>Prostitution usually means sex,

288
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,060
<10-3,LANIE>没有性行为的迹象
<10-3,LANIE>and there's no evidence of sexual activity.

289
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,220
<10-3,LANIE>但我发现了
<10-3,LANIE>But what I did find

290
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,690
<10-3,LANIE>防卫伤  脖子上有瘀伤
<10-3,LANIE>were defensive wounds, bruising around the neck,

291
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,120
<10-3,LANIE>头上有多次撞击的伤痕
<10-3,LANIE>and evidence of multiple blows to the head.

292
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,440
<10-3,LANIE>我猜是有人掐着她的脖子
<10-3,LANIE>I'm guessing someone held her by her throat

293
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,540
<10-3,LANIE>把她的头撞向通风扇
<10-3,LANIE>and slammed her head into that ventilation fan.

294
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,400
<10-3,LANIE>肺里没有水表明
<10-3,LANIE>Lack of water in the lungs indicate

295
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,120
<10-3,LANIE>她是死后被人放进水箱的
<10-3,LANIE>that she was dead before she went in the tank.

296
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
<10-4,CASTLE>那又何必把她放进水箱
<10-4,CASTLE>Then why bother even putting her in there?

297
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,460
<10-5,LANIE>水能冲洗掉证据
<10-5,LANIE>Water has a great way of washing away things

298
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,110
<10-5,LANIE>比如微量DNA
<10-5,LANIE>like trace D.N.A.

299
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,240
<10-6,BECKETT>等一下  我不明白
<10-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute. I don't understand.

300
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,430
<10-6,BECKETT>如果她不是在做爱
<10-6,BECKETT>If she wasn't having sex,

301
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,670
<10-6,BECKETT>那她房里传出来的声音是怎么回事
<10-6,BECKETT>then what were all of those sounds coming out of her room?

302
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,930
<11-1,CASTLE>好吧  她不是妓女
<11-1,CASTLE>Okay. So she wasn't really a hooker,

303
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,160
<11-1,CASTLE>却希望别人以为她是
<11-1,CASTLE>she just wanted everyone to think that she was.

304
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,870
<11-1,CASTLE>为什么呢
<11-1,CASTLE>Why?

305
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,350
<11-2,BECKETT>不知道  但不是每个人都认为她是妓女
<11-2,BECKETT>I don't know, but not everyone thought she was a hooker.

306
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,720
<11-2,BECKETT>隔壁房的家伙  信誓旦旦说她不是
<11-2,BECKETT>That guy next door, he was pretty adamant she wasn't.

307
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,620
<11-3,CASTLE>他知道什么其他人不知道的呢
<11-3,CASTLE>So what did he know that the others didn't?

308
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,700
<12-1,ZIFF>我已经知无不言了
<12-1,ZIFF>I've already told you what I know.

309
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,820
<12-2,BECKETT>你还有所隐瞒  齐夫
<12-2,BECKETT>Not everything, Ziff.

310
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,980
<12-2,BECKETT>你怎么知道她不是妓女
<12-2,BECKETT>How did you know she wasn't a prostitute?

311
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,600
<12-3,ZIFF>拜托  我不想惹麻烦
<12-3,ZIFF>Please, look, I don't want any trouble.

312
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,210
<12-4,BECKETT>-是你杀了她吗  -什么  不是
<12-4,BECKETT>- Did you murder her? - What? No.

313
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,900
<12-6,BECKETT>那你说的话就不会惹上麻烦
<12-6,BECKETT>Then nothing you say is gonna get you into trouble.

314
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,950
<12-7,ZIFF>我听到那种声音
<12-7,ZIFF>Well, I heard those... sounds, you know.

315
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,820
<12-8,BECKETT>快说啊  齐夫
<12-8,BECKETT>Come on, Ziff.

316
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,400
<12-9,ZIFF>衣橱后面的墙上
<12-9,ZIFF>There's a hole...

317
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,780
<12-9,ZIFF>有一个洞
<12-9,ZIFF>in the wall in the back of the closet.

318
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,550
<12-10,BECKETT>你偷窥她
<12-10,BECKETT>You were spying on her?

319
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,990
<12-11,CASTLE>你看到什么了
<12-11,CASTLE>What did you see?

320
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,620
<12-12,ZIFF>问题就在这里  我听到那种声音
<12-12,ZIFF>Well, that's the thing. I heard all those sounds,

321
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,480
<12-12,ZIFF>但房里却完全不是那回事
<12-12,ZIFF>but there was nothing going on.

322
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,100
<12-12,ZIFF>她不过是整晚坐在床上
<12-12,ZIFF>It was just her sitting on the bed all night,

323
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,660
<12-12,ZIFF>穿着衣服  戴着耳机
<12-12,ZIFF>fully dressed, with her headphones on,

324
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,140
<12-12,ZIFF>对着电脑打字
<12-12,ZIFF>typing on her laptop.

325
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,860
<12-13,BECKETT>房里没有电脑
<12-13,BECKETT>There wasn't a laptop in the room.

326
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,570
<12-14,ZIFF>之前有的  她整晚都在弄电脑
<12-14,ZIFF>There used to be. She'd be on it all night,

327
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,370
<12-14,ZIFF>盯着电脑屏幕
<12-14,ZIFF>staring at the screen.

328
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,060
<12-15,CASTLE>你见过她和谁在房里吗
<12-15,CASTLE>Did you ever see anyone else in there with her?

329
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,330
<12-15,CASTLE>没有
<12-15,CASTLE>No.

330
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,330
<12-16,ZIFF>一直只有她一个
<12-16,ZIFF>It was always just her.

331
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,640
<13-1,RYAN>感谢前来  麦克提女士
<13-1,RYAN>Thanks for coming in, Ms. McTeague.

332
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,440
<13-2,TALIA MCTEAGUE>没事  难以置信她死了
<13-2,TALIA MCTEAGUE>Of course. I can't believe she's dead.

333
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,150
<13-3,ESPOSITO>你怎么认识艾丽卡的
<13-3,ESPOSITO>So, um, how did you know Erika?

334
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,140
<13-4,TALIA>我们是哈佛的校友
<13-4,TALIA>We were friends from Harvard.

335
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,440
<13-4,TALIA>都是计算机科学专业的
<13-4,TALIA>We were both computer science majors.

336
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,980
<13-5,RYAN>你知道她来市里干什么吗
<13-5,RYAN>Do you know what she was doing in the city?

337
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,750
<13-6,TALIA>不知道
<13-6,TALIA>No.

338
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,790
<13-7,ESPOSITO>但你两天前跟她一起吃过饭  什么事
<13-7,ESPOSITO>But you had lunch with her two days ago. Why?

339
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,820
<13-7,ESPOSITO>挺  奇怪的
<13-7,ESPOSITO>It was... weird.

340
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,590
<13-8,TALIA>那天早上  我在格林威治一家咖啡店买咖啡
<13-8,TALIA>That morning, I was getting coffee from this place in the village,

341
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,810
<13-8,TALIA>正好看到她在和一个男人大吵
<13-8,TALIA>and I saw her in this big argument with some guy.

342
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,790
<13-8,TALIA>她的穿着跟平时不同
<13-8,TALIA>She was dressed very different--

343
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,480
<13-8,TALIA>十分性感  头发还是粉色的
<13-8,TALIA>sexed up and her hair was pink.

344
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,670
<13-8,TALIA>总之  那个男人气冲冲走了
<13-8,TALIA>Anyway, he storms off,

345
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,980
<13-8,TALIA>我就上前跟她打了个招呼
<13-8,TALIA>and I go up to her to say hello.

346
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,610
<13-8,TALIA>她一脸惊诧地看着我
<13-8,TALIA>And she just looks at me with this panicked look on her face

347
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,020
<13-8,TALIA>然后就跑了
<13-8,TALIA>and--and bolts.

348
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,920
<13-8,TALIA>晚些时候  她找到了我
<13-8,TALIA>Later that day, she tracked me down,

349
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,550
<13-8,TALIA>打到我办公室
<13-8,TALIA>called me at my office, and said

350
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,240
<13-8,TALIA>说要马上见面
<13-8,TALIA>we needed to meet up right away.

351
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
<13-9,RYAN>午餐时发生了什么事
<13-9,RYAN>So what happened at lunch?

352
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,120
<13-10,TALIA>她求我别告诉别人她在市里
<13-10,TALIA>She begged me not to tell anyone that she was in the city,

353
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,420
<13-10,TALIA>她说要是别人知道了
<13-10,TALIA>that if people found out,

354
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,840
<13-10,TALIA>她麻烦就大了
<13-10,TALIA>she could be in a lot of trouble.

355
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,300
<13-11,ESPOSITO>她解释原因了吗
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Did she say why?

356
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,500
<13-12,TALIA>我不断问她到底怎么回事
<13-12,TALIA>I kept asking her what was going on,

357
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,640
<13-12,TALIA>但她就是闭口不谈
<13-12,TALIA>but she wouldn't talk about it.

358
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,850
<13-12,TALIA>她说自己有任务在身
<13-12,TALIA>She said she was on some sort of a mission.

359
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,220
<13-13,ESPOSITO>任务
<13-13,ESPOSITO>A mission?

360
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,960
<13-14,RYAN>跟她吵架的那个人
<13-14,RYAN>This guy that she was arguing with,

361
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,460
<13-14,RYAN>你认识他吗  或者知道他们在吵什么吗
<13-14,RYAN>do you know who he was or what they were arguing about?

362
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,830
<13-14,RYAN>不
<13-14,RYAN>No.

363
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,720
<13-15,TALIA>我只听到他说
<13-15,TALIA>I just heard him say,

364
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,460
<13-15,TALIA>"你不知道自己在跟谁作对"
<13-15,TALIA>"You have no idea what you're up against."

365
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,940
<13-15,TALIA>"那些人不是好惹的"
<13-15,TALIA>"These people don't mess around."

366
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,970
<13-16,ESPOSITO>能形容一下他的长相吗
<13-16,ESPOSITO>Can you describe him?

367
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
<13-17,TALIA>能
<13-17,TALIA>Yeah.

368
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,660
<14-1,ESPOSITO>警员在西德克查问此人
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Uniforms are canvassing the Cedric,

369
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,120
<14-1,ESPOSITO>不过迄今为止  还没人认出他来
<14-1,ESPOSITO>but so far, nobody recognizes him.

370
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,890
<14-2,RYAN>我不明白的是  只是一整晚对着电脑的话
<14-2,RYAN>Here's what I don't get-- why go through all the trouble

371
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,260
<14-2,RYAN>又何必大费周章
<14-2,RYAN>of creating a fake persona

372
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,180
<14-2,RYAN>伪装成另一个人
<14-2,RYAN>when you're just gonna be on your laptop all night?

373
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,550
<14-3,CASTLE>等等
<14-3,CASTLE>Wait.

374
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,880
<14-3,CASTLE>西德克有无线网吗
<14-3,CASTLE>Does the Cedric have wi-fi?

375
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,410
<14-4,RYAN>有  也差不多只有这个了
<14-4,RYAN>Yeah, that's about all it has.

376
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,110
<14-5,CASTLE>计算机科学专业
<14-5,CASTLE>Computer science major,

377
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,880
<14-5,CASTLE>一直对着电脑埋头苦干
<14-5,CASTLE>hours on her laptop?

378
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,860
<14-6,BECKETT>她是个黑客
<14-6,BECKETT>She's a hacker,

379
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,350
<14-6,BECKETT>所以她才去住西德克
<14-6,BECKETT>which is why she was staying at the Cedric.

380
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,980
<14-6,BECKETT>她能付现金匿名入住
<14-6,BECKETT>She could pay in cash and remain anonymous

381
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,420
<14-6,BECKETT>并用旅馆的IP地址
<14-6,BECKETT>while she was using the I.P. Address.

382
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,910
<14-7,CASTLE>没错  而且她黑的一定是
<14-7,CASTLE>Exactly, and whatever she was hacking into

383
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,520
<14-7,CASTLE>非法的或者有危险内容的网站
<14-7,CASTLE>was either so illegal or so dangerous,

384
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,130
<14-7,CASTLE>所以要确保别人不会查到她头上
<14-7,CASTLE>she had to make sure they couldn't trace it back to her.

385
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,690
<14-7,CASTLE>就算查到她了
<14-7,CASTLE>And even if they did trace it back to her,

386
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,250
<14-7,CASTLE>还得从几百个房客中把她找出来
<14-7,CASTLE>they'd still have to find her amongst hundreds of residents.

387
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,070
<14-8,BECKETT>所以她创造了个假身份
<14-8,BECKETT>So she created a whole false persona.

388
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,970
<14-8,BECKETT>谁会在意一个居无定所的妓女呢
<14-8,BECKETT>And who's gonna look twice at a runaway hooker?

389
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,810
<14-8,BECKETT>她就像是"龙纹身的女孩"
<14-8,BECKETT>I mean, she's like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

390
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,050
<14-9,CASTLE>但她的确被人发现了
<14-9,CASTLE>Only they did find her,

391
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,890
<14-9,CASTLE>所以我们找不到她的电脑
<14-9,CASTLE>which is why we can't find her laptop.

392
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,150
<14-9,CASTLE>无论她对付的是谁
<14-9,CASTLE>Whoever she went up against

393
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,380
<14-9,CASTLE>是他们杀了她  拿走了电脑
<14-9,CASTLE>killed her and took it.

394
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,790
<14-10,ESPOSITO>有问题  我们不知道她对付的人是谁
<14-10,ESPOSITO>Uh, problem. We don't know who she went up against,

395
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,890
<14-10,ESPOSITO>而且她的朋友貌似也都不知道
<14-10,ESPOSITO>and none of her friends seem to know either.

396
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,350
<14-11,BECKETT>好吧  联系西德克的网络供应商
<14-11,BECKETT>Okay, contact the Cedric's internet provider

397
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,960
<14-11,BECKETT>让他们提供一份过去两周内所有
<14-11,BECKETT>and get a list of all the I.P. addresses

398
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,230
<14-11,BECKETT>所有住户登入过的IP地址清单
<14-11,BECKETT>accessed by residents over the past two weeks.

399
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,740
<14-11,BECKETT>上面应该会找到些线索
<14-11,BECKETT>There's gotta be an answer somewhere in there.

400
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,960
<14-12,CASTLE>我今天晚上不写了
<14-12,CASTLE>How about I take a break from writing tonight,

401
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,000
<14-12,CASTLE>你来我家咱们喝一杯怎么样
<14-12,CASTLE>you come to my place, I open a bottle of wine?

402
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
<14-12,CASTLE>贝克特探长
<14-12,CASTLE>Detective Beckett.

403
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,910
<14-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>能说句话吗
<14-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Can I have a word?

404
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,300
<14-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>好的
<14-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Yes.

405
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,660
<14-14,BECKETT>等会儿见
<14-14,BECKETT>I'll catch you later?

406
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,210
<14-15,CASTLE>快去吧
<14-15,CASTLE>She's all yours.

407
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,000
<15-1,BECKETT>长官
<15-1,BECKETT>Sir.

408
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,470
<15-2,GATES>关门
<15-2,GATES>Shut the door.

409
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,790
<15-3,GATES>坐吧
<15-3,GATES>Have a seat.

410
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,570
<15-4,GATES>我...
<15-4,GATES>I,uh...

411
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,410
<15-4,GATES>刚刚接到了一个关于你的电话
<15-4,GATES>just got a call about you...

412
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,790
<15-4,GATES>是联调局副局长打来的
<15-4,GATES>from the deputy director of the FBI.

413
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,400
<15-4,GATES>看来你今早去过特区
<15-4,GATES>Apparently you had quite the interview in D. C.

414
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,970
<15-4,GATES>进行重要面试
<15-4,GATES>this morning.

415
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,540
<15-5,BECKETT>长官...
<15-5,BECKETT>Look,sir,it was--

416
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,610
<15-6,GATES>我只是想跟你说
<15-6,GATES>I just want to tell you that,um...

417
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,410
<15-6,GATES>我给了你最高评价
<15-6,GATES>I gave you my highest recommendation.

418
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,620
<15-7,BECKETT>是吗
<15-7,BECKETT>You did?

419
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,410
<15-8,GATES>凯特  你本来就应该做这种工作
<15-8,GATES>Kate,this is the kind of work you were meant to be doing.

420
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,560
<15-8,GATES>你应该为国家效力  发挥你的聪明才智
<15-8,GATES>You'd be on the national stage, utilizing all your talents.

421
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,500
<15-8,GATES>这是个极好的机会
<15-8,GATES>This is an incredible opportunity.

422
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,440
<15-8,GATES>我像你这么大的时候  一定会为这种机会
<15-8,GATES>I would've killed to have a shot at something like this

423
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,620
<15-8,GATES>不惜一切
<15-8,GATES>when I was your age.

424
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,640
<15-9,BECKETT>谢谢你  长官  不过这只是一个面试
<15-9,BECKETT>Thank you,sir,but it was just an interview.

425
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,460
<15-9,BECKETT>而且希望也比较渺茫
<15-9,BECKETT>I mean,it's a long shot at best.

426
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,760
<15-10,GATES>我看未必
<15-10,GATES>No,I wouldn't be so sure about that.

427
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,140
<15-10,GATES>据我所知  你已入围最终候选人
<15-10,GATES>From what I hear, you're on a short list.

428
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,810
<15-10,GATES>如果幸运的话  这将是你最后一件案子
<15-10,GATES>And with any luck, this could be your last case.

429
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,860
<16-1,LANIE>你吓着我了
<16-1,LANIE>Oh,girl,you scared me.

430
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,870
<16-1,LANIE>你这么早在这儿干什么
<16-1,LANIE>What are you doing here so early?

431
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,570
<16-2,BECKETT>我想来看看你在受害人身上有没有新发现
<16-2,BECKETT>I just wanted to see if you had anything new on the victim.

432
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,540
<16-3,LANIE>我能把死亡时间确定在
<16-3,LANIE>Well,I was able to place time of death

433
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,080
<16-3,LANIE>半夜12点到凌晨1点之间
<16-3,LANIE>between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 a. m.

434
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,670
<16-4,BECKETT>还在她的指甲里发现了木馏油
<16-4,BECKETT>Oh,and I found traces of creosote under her fingernails,

435
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,220
<16-5,LANIE>但这发现没什么用
<16-5,LANIE>which is probably meaningless

436
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,150
<16-5,LANIE>因为锅炉房就在洗衣房旁边
<16-5,LANIE>since the boiler room is right next to the laundry room...

437
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,940
<16-5,LANIE>她下楼的时候可能会不小心沾在手上
<16-5,LANIE>And it could've gotten on her hands when she went down there.

438
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,280
<16-5,LANIE>但是
<16-5,LANIE>But...

439
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,820
<16-6,LANIE>这不是你来的原因  是吧
<16-6,LANIE>that's not why you're here,is it?

440
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,170
<16-6,LANIE>好吧  怎么了
<16-6,LANIE>Okay. What's wrong?

441
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,980
<16-6,LANIE>现在还...
<16-6,LANIE>Nothing...

442
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,350
<16-7,BECKETT>没什么

<16-7,BECKETT>to do something that you wanted to do

445
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,670
<16-7,BECKETT>但是可能同时意味着...
<16-7,BECKETT>but it would mean that...

446
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,300
<16-7,BECKETT>你现有的生活将会发生重大的转变
<16-7,BECKETT>everything in your life might change,

<16-8,LANIE>这要看情况
<16-8,LANIE>Well,it depends.

454
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,030
<16-11,BECKETT>我们从没讨论过以后
<16-11,BECKETT>we never talk about where we're going.

455
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,010
<16-11,BECKETT>现在倒是没什么  只是...
<16-11,BECKETT>And that's okay right now. It's just...

456
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,900
<16-11,BECKETT>如果我接受了这工作
<16-11,BECKETT>But if I get that job...

457
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,760
<16-12,LANIE>那你们就必须作出决定
<16-12,LANIE>Then you're gonna have to.

458
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,540
<16-13,BECKETT>是的
<16-13,BECKETT>Yeah.

459
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,650
<16-14,LANIE>或许这也不是坏事
<16-14,LANIE>Maybe that's not such a bad thing.

460
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,600
<16-15,BECKETT>但是如果是呢
<16-15,BECKETT>Yeah,but what if it is?

461
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,680
<16-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<16-15,BECKETT>Hey,Castle.

465
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,500
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>我查了所有通过
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>So I ran down all the I. P. addresses

466
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,590
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>旅馆服务器登陆的IP地址
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>that were accessed through the hotel server...

467
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,380
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>想知道被害人在做什么
<17-1,TORY ELLIS>to find out what our victim was up to.

468
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,490
<17-2,ESPOSITO>找到了吗
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Any luck?

469
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,530
<17-3,TORY>大多数登入的IP地址都是黄色网站
<17-3,TORY>The majority of the I. P. s were to porn sites.

470
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,330
<17-4,ESPOSITO>是吗  都有哪些
<17-4,ESPOSITO>Really,which ones?

471
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,910
<17-5,TORY>我直接把那些排除了
<17-5,TORY>I took the liberty of ruling those out,

472
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,670
<17-5,TORY>也排除了正常的商业网站
<17-5,TORY>as well as normal commercial sites--

473
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,590
<17-5,TORY>谷歌  亚马逊  视频网站
<17-5,TORY>Google,Amazon,YouTube.

474
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,430
<17-5,TORY>减少到了几百个网站
<17-5,TORY>That narrowed it down to a couple hundred sites.

475
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,960
<17-6,RYAN>那我们现在还是在大海捞针
<17-6,RYAN>So we're still looking for a needle in a haystack.

476
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,150
<17-7,TORY>也不是  我反复排查
<17-7,TORY>Not necessarily. I took those and went back,

477
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,410
<17-7,TORY>找到一些登入时间与被害人登记入住时间
<17-7,TORY>looking for multiple unique site hits that coincided with the dates

478
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,550
<17-7,TORY>相同的网站
<17-7,TORY>your victim was checked in to the hotel.

479
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,120
<17-7,TORY>还剩下20个左右
<17-7,TORY>That left about 20.

480
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,280
<17-8,ESPOSITO>这下好多了
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Now we're talking,girl.

481
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,120
<17-8,ESPOSITO>-20个我应付得来  -稍安勿躁
<17-8,ESPOSITO>- I-I can deal with 20. - You might not have to.

482
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,170
<17-9,TORY>在那20个里面  我找了一些目击者声称
<17-9,TORY>Of those 20, I looked for I. P. s that were accessed late at night...

483
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,960
<17-9,TORY>被害人在夜里使用电脑的时间段里
<17-9,TORY>during the period when your witness claimed...

484
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,900
<17-9,TORY>被登入的IP地址
<17-9,TORY>the victim was on her laptop.

485
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,950
<17-9,TORY>这个极可能就是你们要找的
<17-9,TORY>This is your most likely candidate.

486
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,390
<17-9,TORY>艾丽卡在旅馆里的每个晚上这个服务器IP
<17-9,TORY>The server I. P. was accessed multiple times a night

<17-9,TORY>nearly every night Erika was at the hotel.

488
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,400
<17-10,ESPOSITO>那这个IP属于哪里
<17-10,ESPOSITO>And who's it belong to?

489
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,990
<18-1,RYAN>IP地址来自班克斯·布尔律所
<18-1,RYAN>I. P. was traced to Banks and Bauer.

490
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,170

492
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,360
<18-2,CASTLE>可能艾丽卡就像是黑客版
<18-2,CASTLE>Maybe Erika was some kind of

493

497
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,410
<18-3,BECKETT>可能她只是被对手公司雇佣
<18-3,BECKETT>Or maybe she was just hired by a rival firm

498
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,370
<18-3,BECKETT>去窃取一些机密信息
<18-3,BECKETT>to steal privileged information.

<18-4,CASTLE>你怎么这么愤世嫉俗
<18-4,CASTLE>Now why must you be so cynical?

<20-2,BECKETT>你的软件可能检不出来
<20-2,BECKETT>your software may not pick it up.

524
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,140
<20-2,BECKETT>有没有什么方法可以查看

<21-1,ESPOSITO>知道她在找什么
<21-1,ESPOSITO>knew what she was looking for either?

543
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,110
<21-2,BECKETT>要么就是他们在隐瞒什么
<21-2,BECKETT>Either that or they're covering something up.

544
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,220
<21-2,BECKETT>唯一的证据就只在那台

<21-3,CASTLE>Much like Erika.

548
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,930
<21-4,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>玩笑开得太早
<21-4,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>Too soon.

549
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,460
<21-4,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>伙计们  有线索了
<21-4,CASTLE_ESPOSITO>Hey, guys. I got something.

550
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,570
<21-5,RYAN>她约朋友吃午饭的那通电话
<21-5,RYAN>That phone call that she made to her friend to arrange lunch

551
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,290
<21-5,RYAN>让我很好奇她到底是从哪里打来的
<21-5,RYAN>had me wondering exactly where that call came from.

552
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,650
<21-5,RYAN>结果是旅馆里的公用电话
<21-5,RYAN>Turns out, it was a payphone at the hotel.

553
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,770
<21-5,RYAN>于是我查了那台电话的其他呼叫
<21-5,RYAN>So I ran down the other calls made from that phone.

554
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,070
<21-5,RYAN>有一通很显眼
<21-5,RYAN>One of 'em popped.

555
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,730
<21-6,BECKETT>伊恩·布雷洛克
<21-6,BECKETT>Ian Blaylock?

556
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,590
<21-7,RYAN>他以前是班克斯·布尔律所的律师
<21-7,RYAN>Yeah, he was an attorney at Banks and Bauer

557
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,730
<21-7,RYAN>六个月前被开除了
<21-7,RYAN>until he was fired six months ago.

558
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,020
<21-7,RYAN>她打过三个电话给他
<21-7,RYAN>She made three phone calls to him from that phone.

559
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,030
<21-7,RYAN>都超过了五分钟
<21-7,RYAN>Each lasting over five minutes.

560
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,460
<21-7,RYAN>这是布雷洛克
<21-7,RYAN>This is Blaylock.

561
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,870
<22-1,BECKETT>布雷洛克先生  纽约警局
<22-1,BECKETT>Mr. Blaylock, NYPD.

562
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,880
<22-1,BECKETT>布雷洛克先生  快开门
<22-1,BECKETT>Mr. Blaylock, open up.

563
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,170
<22-2,CASTLE>事情越来越复杂了
<22-2,CASTLE>I think our plot just thickened.

564
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,860
<23-1,LANIE>我很肯定这不是自杀
<23-1,LANIE>I'm pretty sure this wasn't a suicide.

565
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,880
<23-2,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<23-2,BECKETT>How can you tell?

566
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,800
<23-3,LANIE>看到脖子上这条斜向勒痕了吗
<23-3,LANIE>See that diagonal ligature mark running up his neck?

567
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,390
<23-4,BECKETT>嗯
<23-4,BECKETT>Yeah.

568
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,990
<23-5,LANIE>这个的确该有
<23-5,LANIE>Well, that's what we'd expect to find

569
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,930
<23-5,LANIE>因为身体的重量
<23-5,LANIE>because the weight of the body

570
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,880
<23-5,LANIE>使绳子垂直了
<23-5,LANIE>pulls the cord into a vertical line.

571
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,670
<23-6,CASTLE>但是呢
<23-6,CASTLE>But?

572
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,590
<23-7,LANIE>但这条浅一点的勒痕
<23-7,LANIE>But this other faint ligature mark--

573
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,090
<23-7,LANIE>看到勒痕沿着他的脖子是水平的吗
<23-7,LANIE>See how it runs horizontally across his neck?

574
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,830
<23-8,BECKETT>他是被勒死的
<23-8,BECKETT>He was strangled first.

575
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,790
<23-9,LANIE>然后才被吊了起来
<23-9,LANIE>Then strung up.

576
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,120
<23-10,CASTLE>那这是第二起谋杀案了
<23-10,CASTLE>So we have a second murder.

577
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,870
<23-11,LANIE>严格来说  这是第一起
<23-11,LANIE>Well, technically, it's the first murder.

578
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,640
<23-11,LANIE>考虑到尸温和尸体腐烂程度
<23-11,LANIE>Given temperature and decomposition,

579
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,310
<23-11,LANIE>死亡时间应该比水箱里的姑娘
<23-11,LANIE>I'd say he died at least a day

580
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,990
<23-11,LANIE>至少早一天
<23-11,LANIE>before our lady in the water tank.

582
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,960
<23-13,RYAN>我在查看布雷洛克的近期活动
<23-13,RYAN>So I was going through Blaylock's recent activity.

583
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,630
<23-13,RYAN>我发现了他
<23-13,RYAN>I found this chat exchange

584
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,300
<23-13,RYAN>和一个匿名用户的聊天记录
<23-13,RYAN>between him and an anonymous user.

585
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,680
<23-14,BECKETT>"我改主意了"
<23-14,BECKETT>"Changed my mind."

586
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,470
<23-14,BECKETT>"我再也不能这样下去了"
<23-14,BECKETT>"Can't live like this anymore."

587
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,580
<23-14,BECKETT>"我要把真相都告诉你"
<23-14,BECKETT>"Will tell you everything I know."

588
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,110
<23-14,BECKETT>"在哪里见面"
<23-14,BECKETT>"Where can we meet? "

589
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,510
<23-15,RYAN>这个人回答  "我的住处附近有个地方
<23-15,RYAN>The person replies, "There's a place near where I'm staying.

590
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,840
<23-15,RYAN>西德克旅馆  天台  晚上十二点见"
<23-15,RYAN>Cedric Hotel. Rooftop. At midnight. "

591
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,430
<23-16,BECKETT>是她约他在上面见的
<23-16,BECKETT>She asked him to meet her up there.

592
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,610
<23-17,RYAN>她肯定以为那是她的安全地带
<23-17,RYAN>She must have thought it was a location she could control.

593
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,350
<23-18,CASTLE>看他发消息的时间
<23-18,CASTLE>Uh, guys, look what time he sent the message.

594
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,430
<23-19,RYAN>她被害那晚的十点钟
<23-19,RYAN>10: 00 p. m. the night she was murdered.

595
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,180
<23-20,CASTLE>但是根据蕾妮推测的死亡时间
<23-20,CASTLE>Right, but according to Lanie's time of death,

596
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,570
<23-20,CASTLE>布雷洛克那时候已经死了
<23-20,CASTLE>Blaylock was already dead.

597
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,870
<23-21,BECKETT>这是凶手发的
<23-21,BECKETT>So this was sent by whoever killed him.

598
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,030
<23-21,BECKETT>他把她引了出来
<23-21,BECKETT>He lured her out.

599
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,440
<23-22,CASTLE>又把她杀了
<23-22,CASTLE>Then killed her, too.

600
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,520
<24-1,BECKETT>律所的人坚称
<24-1,BECKETT>So the folks at the law firm claim

601
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,220
<24-1,BECKETT>他们不知道为什么有人要杀布雷洛克
<24-1,BECKETT>that they have no idea why anyone would murder Blaylock

602
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,310
<24-1,BECKETT>也不知道艾丽卡为什么要找布雷洛克
<24-1,BECKETT>Or why Erika was looking for him.

603
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,220
<24-2,CASTLE>最起码告诉了你为什么开除布雷洛克吧
<24-2,CASTLE>Did they at least tell you why they let Blaylock go?

604
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,780
<24-3,BECKETT>只说了是私人原因
<24-3,BECKETT>Only that it was a personal issue.

605
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,400
<24-3,BECKETT>肯定很严重咯
<24-3,BECKETT>Well, it must have been pretty serious.

606
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
<24-4,ESPOSITO>我们跟他的朋友谈过
<24-4,ESPOSITO>We checked with friends.

607
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,990
<24-4,ESPOSITO>显然  他是颗冉冉升起的新星
<24-4,ESPOSITO>Apparently, he was a rising star at the firm

608
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,420
<24-4,ESPOSITO>直到一年前  很突然地
<24-4,ESPOSITO>until about a year ago when, out of the blue,

609
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,620
<24-4,ESPOSITO>他变得很内向  也很离群
<24-4,ESPOSITO>he just became distant and withdrawn.

610
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,120
<24-4,ESPOSITO>婚姻破裂  开始吸毒
<24-4,ESPOSITO>His marriage fell apart, and he started doing drugs.

611
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,650
<24-4,ESPOSITO>好像是有事情发生了
<24-4,ESPOSITO>It's like something happened.

612
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,860
<24-5,BECKETT>艾丽卡在调查律所
<24-5,BECKETT>So Erika was looking into the firm.

613
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,560
<24-5,BECKETT>布雷洛克以前在律所工作
<24-5,BECKETT>Blaylock used to work at the firm.

614
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,210
<24-5,BECKETT>结果他们都死了
<24-5,BECKETT>And now they're both dead.

615
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,560
<24-5,BECKETT>为什么呢
<24-5,BECKETT>Why?

616
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,750
<24-6,RYAN>刚从艾丽卡父母那里得到消息
<24-6,RYAN>Just heard back from Erika's parents.

617
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,480
<24-6,RYAN>他们感觉律所名字很耳熟
<24-6,RYAN>The law firm rang a bell.

618
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,940
<24-6,RYAN>结果发现艾丽卡高中的闺蜜
<24-6,RYAN>Turns out that Erika's best friend from high school

619
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,690
<24-6,RYAN>帕姆·邦纳  去年夏天在律所实习
<24-6,RYAN>interned there last summer-- a Pam Bonner.

620
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,540
<3-10,CASTLE>好
<3-10,CASTLE>Okay.

621
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,730
<24-7,BECKETT>也许她能帮我们解决一些问题
<24-7,BECKETT>Maybe she can give us some answers.

622
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,240
<24-7,BECKETT>她在哪里
<24-7,BECKETT>Where do we find her?

623
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,610
<24-8,RYAN>韦斯切斯特的希望山公墓
<24-8,RYAN>Um, Mount Hope Cemetery in Westchester.

624
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,630
<24-8,RYAN>她去年夏天死于车祸
<24-8,RYAN>She was killed last summer in a car crash.

625
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,710
<24-9,CASTLE>当时情形如何
<24-9,CASTLE>What were the circumstances?

626
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,010
<24-10,RYAN>没有目击者
<24-10,RYAN>Well, there were no witnesses,

627
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,320
<24-10,RYAN>但根据警方的报告
<24-10,RYAN>but according to the police report,

628
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,580
<24-10,RYAN>她当时刚离开律所的夏季派对开车回家
<24-10,RYAN>she was driving home from the firm's summer party.

629
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,840
<24-10,RYAN>车子失控  撞到了树上
<24-10,RYAN>She lost control and crashed into a tree.

630
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,490
<24-10,RYAN>尸检表示她是醉驾
<24-10,RYAN>Autopsy indicates that she was intoxicated at the time.

631
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,310
<24-10,RYAN>但艾丽卡不相信官方的报告
<24-10,RYAN>But Erika never believed the official account.

632
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,700
<24-11,BECKETT>知道为什么吗
<24-11,BECKETT>Any reason why?

633
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,450
<24-12,RYAN>她不信帕姆会醉驾
<24-12,RYAN>Well, she believed that Pam would never drive drunk.

634
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,220
<24-12,RYAN>警方发现帕姆时  她穿着高跟鞋
<24-12,RYAN>And when they found Pam, she was wearing high heels,

635
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,420
<24-12,RYAN>艾丽卡说她从来不穿高跟鞋开车
<24-12,RYAN>and Erika said she never drove in heels.

636
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,640
<24-13,CASTLE>三条人命
<24-13,CASTLE>Three deaths,

637
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,320
<24-13,CASTLE>都和班克斯·布尔律所有关
<24-13,CASTLE>all leading back to the law firm of Banks and Bauer.

638
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,490
<24-13,CASTLE>约翰·格里森姆小说的感觉
<24-13,CASTLE>Is it just me, or is this starting to smell like

639
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,040
<24-13,CASTLE>有没有
<24-13,CASTLE>a John Grisham novel?

640
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,040
<24-13,CASTLE>畅销小说作家
<24-13,CASTLE>大多数作品为法律悬念小说

641
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,440
<24-13,CASTLE>一场没有目击者的车祸
<24-13,CASTLE>A single-car accident with no witnesses?

642
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,140
<24-13,CASTLE>这是经典的掩盖阴谋的手段
<24-13,CASTLE>Guys, this is a classic conspiracy cover-up.

643
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,460
<24-13,CASTLE>虽然她只是个实习生
<24-13,CASTLE>Though only a lowly intern,

644
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,900
<24-13,CASTLE>帕姆发现了律所正在谋划的
<24-13,CASTLE>Pam stumbles onto something the firm is doing,

645
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,570
<24-13,CASTLE>什么邪恶大阴谋
<24-13,CASTLE>something big, nefarious.

646
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,920
<24-13,CASTLE>她必须被灭口  但是事故之后
<24-13,CASTLE>She has to be silenced, only after the accident,

647
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,800
<24-13,CASTLE>布雷洛克内疚不已又不能说出真相
<24-13,CASTLE>Blaylock can't take the guilt or admit the truth.

648
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,590
<24-13,CASTLE>所以他唯一能做的就是沉溺在毒品中
<24-13,CASTLE>So his only bastion is to escape into the sweet oblivion of drugs.

649
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,150
<24-14,BECKETT>当艾丽卡找过来的时候
<24-14,BECKETT>And then when Erika starts coming around,

650
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,400
<24-14,BECKETT>他们意识到必须把两个人都干掉
<24-14,BECKETT>they realize that they're gonna have to act by eliminating them both.

651
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,450
<24-14,BECKETT>但他们在掩盖些什么呢
<24-14,BECKETT>But what are they covering up?

652
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,020
<24-15,RYAN>不管是什么
<24-15,RYAN>Whatever it is,

653
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,400
<24-15,RYAN>唯一可能的证据在艾丽卡的笔记本电脑里
<24-15,RYAN>the only possible evidence is on Erika's laptop,

654
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,510
<24-15,RYAN>被凶手拿走了
<24-15,RYAN>which our killer took.

655
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,540
<24-16,CASTLE>嗯  等等  我们能确定吗
<24-16,CASTLE>Yeah. Wait, are we sure about that?

656
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,750
<24-16,CASTLE>艾丽卡和布雷洛克约在楼顶见面  对吗
<24-16,CASTLE>Erika was meeting Blaylock on the roof, right?

657
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,480
<24-16,CASTLE>根据电邮  她跟这个男人并不熟
<24-16,CASTLE>A guy who, according to the e-mail, she didn't know very well.

658
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,400
<24-16,CASTLE>如果我是艾丽卡  就会把笔记本电脑藏起来
<24-16,CASTLE>If I'm Erika, I'm hiding that laptop.

659
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,190
<24-17,ESPOSITO>我们搜了她的房间  不在那儿
<24-17,ESPOSITO>Well, we searched her room. It wasn't there.

660
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,740
<24-18,BECKETT>等等  你们还记得电梯的监控录像吗
<24-18,BECKETT>Wait. Do you guys remember the footage from the elevator?

661
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,390
<24-19,CASTLE>记得  她先去了趟洗衣房
<24-19,CASTLE>Yes. She went down to the laundry room first.

662
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,410
<24-20,BECKETT>蕾妮说在她的指甲里发现了杂酚油的痕迹
<24-20,BECKETT>And Lanie said that she found traces of creosote under her fingernails

663
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,260
<24-20,BECKETT>它来自隔壁的锅炉房
<24-20,BECKETT>from the boiler room next door.

664
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,390
<24-21,CASTLE_BECKETT>笔记本电脑藏在地下室
<24-21,CASTLE_BECKETT>The laptop's in the basement.

665
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,050
<25-1,RYAN>真是的  这明明卡塞尔的推论
<25-1,RYAN>Oh, man. This was Castle's theory.

666
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,460
<25-1,RYAN>为什么让我们来干这个
<25-1,RYAN>How'd we draw the short straw?

667
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,280
<25-2,ESPOSITO>不知道  我问你
<25-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know. Let me ask you something.

668
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,140
<25-2,ESPOSITO>你有没有发现贝克特有点不对劲
<25-2,ESPOSITO>You notice anything weird about Beckett?

669
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,300
<25-3,RYAN>什么意思
<25-3,RYAN>What do you mean?

670
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:39,280
<25-4,ESPOSITO>她跟平时不太一样  不太对劲
<25-4,ESPOSITO>Well, she's... She's different. Something's off.

671
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,720
<25-5,RYAN>你在说什么  比如她怀孕了  或者
<25-5,RYAN>What are you saying, like, she's pregnant or...

672
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,660
<25-6,ESPOSITO>你在说什么啊  怎么想的啊
<25-6,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about? Where did that even come from?

673
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,320
<25-7,RYAN>是你说她不太一样了啊
<25-7,RYAN>Well, you said she was acting different.

674
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,650
<25-7,RYAN>他们都是成年人  你情我愿的
<25-7,RYAN>They're consenting adults--

675
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,980
<25-8,ESPOSITO>贝克特没有怀孕  拜托啊兄弟
<25-8,ESPOSITO>Beckett is not pregnant. Come on, man.

676
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,040
<25-9,RYAN>怀孕就这么离谱吗
<25-9,RYAN>What's so wrong about being pregnant?

677
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,790
<25-10,ESPOSITO>我现在完全不能跟你讨论这个
<25-10,ESPOSITO>You know, I-I can't even talk to you about this right now.

678
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,620
<25-11,RYAN>那好吧
<25-11,RYAN>Okay. Well, um,

679
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,470
<25-11,RYAN>珍妮告诉你消息的时候  克服一下好吗
<25-11,RYAN>Try to get over it before Jenny tells you the news,okay?

680
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,060
<25-12,ESPOSITO>什么  说真的吗
<25-12,ESPOSITO>What? Are you serious?

681
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,910
<25-12,ESPOSITO>恭喜你  太棒了
<25-12,ESPOSITO>Congratulations, man. That's great.

<25-13,RYAN>Thanks, man.

683
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
<25-14,ESPOSITO>等等  上面有东西
<25-14,ESPOSITO>Hold up. There's something up here.

684
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,510
<25-14,ESPOSITO>-这是什么  -笔记本电脑
<25-14,ESPOSITO>- What's that? - That's a laptop.

685
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,350
<26-1,BECKETT>好的  好极了  谢谢
<26-1,BECKETT>Okay. No, that's great. Thank you.

686
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,360
<26-1,BECKETT>他们找到笔记本电脑了
<26-1,BECKETT>So they found the laptop.

687
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,160
<26-2,CASTLE>我就知道  里面有什么
<26-2,CASTLE>I knew it. So what was on it?

688
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,280
<26-3,BECKETT>硬盘被加密了  技术人员正在破解
<26-3,BECKETT>Well, the hard drive is encrypted, so techs are going through it now.

689
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,560
<26-4,CASTLE>那台电脑里藏着罪恶而致命的
<26-4,CASTLE>Well, somewhere on that computer is a conspiracy of lies so heinous,

690
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,740
<26-4,CASTLE>阴谋谎言
<26-4,CASTLE>So deadly...

691
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,350
<26-6,BECKETT>-这是什么  -什么什么

<26-7,CASTLE>Boarding pass.

693
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,820
<26-9,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  -你昨天去了特区
<26-9,BECKETT>- Castle-- - You fly to D.C. Yesterday?

694
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,460
<26-10,BECKETT>-是的  -为什么
<26-10,BECKETT>- Yes, I did. - Why?

695
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,790
<26-12,BECKETT>我受邀参加一场面试
<26-12,BECKETT>I was invited down for an interview.

696
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,560
<26-13,CASTLE>什么面试
<26-13,CASTLE>What kind of interview?

697

<26-14,BECKETT>联邦特别工作组的一个职位
<26-14,BECKETT>For a position with a federal task force.

698
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,260
<26-14,BECKETT>不好意思
<26-14,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

699
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,290
<26-15,CASTLE>你去另一个城市面试另一份工作
<26-15,CASTLE>You interviewed for another job in another city...

700
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,250
<26-15,CASTLE>却不告诉我
<26-15,CASTLE>and you didn't tell me?

701
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,780
<26-16,BECKETT>不告诉你是因为这只是一场面试
<26-16,BECKETT>I didn't tell you about it because it was just an interview,

702
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,170
<26-16,BECKETT>我知道你会生气
<26-16,BECKETT>and I knew that you would be upset.

703
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,380
<26-17,CASTLE>是的  你说对了  我很生气
<26-17,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, you're damn right, I'm upset.

704
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,740
<26-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我只想去了解一下
<26-18,BECKETT>Castle, I just wanted to see what was out there.

705
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,590
<26-18,BECKETT>这样怎么了
<26-18,BECKETT>What's wrong with that?

706
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,790
<26-19,CASTLE>问题在于你瞒着我
<26-19,CASTLE>What's wrong with it is that you hid it from me.

707
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,040
<26-19,CASTLE>事实上  你说谎了  我却不会这样对你
<26-19,CASTLE>In fact, you lied about it. I wouldn't do that to you.

708
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,730
<26-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这跟你无关  这是我的事
<26-20,BECKETT>Castle, this isn't about you. This is about me.

709
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,850
<26-20,BECKETT>这是我的人生
<26-20,BECKETT>This is about my life.

710
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,250
<26-21,CASTLE>所以你在认真考虑这件事吗
<26-21,CASTLE>So you're seriously considering this?

711
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,420
<26-22,BECKETT>当然  这是一次绝好的机会
<26-22,BECKETT>Yes. This is a wonderful opportunity.

712
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,600
<26-22,BECKETT>有机会做得更多
<26-22,BECKETT>It'll be a chance to do more.

713
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,170
<26-23,CASTLE>但跟我无关了
<26-23,CASTLE>Without me.

714
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,660
<26-24,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别这样  别扯到我们俩个身上
<26-24,BECKETT>Castle, please don't do this. Please don't make this about us.

715
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,300
<26-25,CASTLE>不好意思  说说这怎么能不扯到我们身上
<26-25,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Tell me how this isn't about us?

716
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,980
<26-25,CASTLE>你得到这份工作  搬去特区  我再也见不到你
<26-25,CASTLE>You get this job, you move to D.C., I'll never see you.

717
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,320
<26-25,CASTLE>我们的关系到此结束  不是吗
<26-25,CASTLE>That's pretty much the end of our relationship, isn't it?

718
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,860
<26-26,BECKETT>这可难说
<26-26,BECKETT>You don't know that.

719
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,550
<26-26,BECKETT>我可能得不到那份工作
<26-26,BECKETT>And I probably won't even get the job.

720
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,040
<26-27,CASTLE>这不是重点
<26-27,CASTLE>That's not the point.

721
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,820
<26-27,CASTLE>重点是  你知道这意味着什么
<26-27,CASTLE>The point is, you knew what this could mean

722
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,280
<26-27,CASTLE>却没有想到要跟我商量
<26-27,CASTLE>and it didn't occur to you to include me.

723
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,750
<26-27,CASTLE>或者更糟  你想到了
<26-27,CASTLE>Or worse, It did occur to you...

724
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,780
<26-27,CASTLE>但你决定不跟我商量
<26-27,CASTLE>and you chose not to.

725
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,240
<26-27,CASTLE>这说明我们到底算什么
<26-27,CASTLE>Now what does that say about us?

726
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,650
<26-27,CASTLE>要我说  不算什么
<26-27,CASTLE>Not much, you ask me.

727
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,860
<26-29,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -我不能留在这儿了
<26-29,CASTLE>- Castle-- - I can't be here right now.

728
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,380
<26-29,CASTLE>-你还好吗  -好
<26-29,CASTLE>- You okay - Yep.

729
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,540
<26-29,CASTLE>-卡塞尔人呢  -不知道
<26-29,CASTLE>- Where's Castle? - I don't know.

730
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,170
<28-1,BECKETT>我们吵架了
<28-1,BECKETT>We had a fight, okay?

731
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,100
<28-2,ESPOSITO>什么  是平时那种吵架  还是
<28-2,ESPOSITO>What, like a regular fight or...

732
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,790
<28-3,ESPOSITO>有多糟
<28-3,ESPOSITO>How bad?

733
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,720
<28-4,RYAN>伙计们  有发现
<28-4,RYAN>Hey, guys. We got something.

736
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,220
<29-1,TORY>然后是客户和人事档案
<29-1,TORY>Then she moved on to client and personal files.

737
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,650
<29-2,ESPOSITO>知道她在找什么吗
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Do we know what she was looking for?

738
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,950
<29-3,RYAN>不好说  但是在最后几晚
<29-3,RYAN>Hard to say, but for the last few nights,

739
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,010
<29-3,RYAN>艾丽卡在重点调查会计部门

<29-4,ESPOSITO>The accounting department?

741
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,300
<29-5,RYAN>看来她在查找
<29-5,RYAN>It appears that she was looking into

742

<29-5,RYAN>伊恩·布雷洛克的计费工时记录

<29-6,TORY>Focusing exclusively on one week last summer.

744
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,830
<29-7,BECKETT>等一下
<29-7,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

745
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,190
<29-7,BECKETT>就是帕姆拉·邦纳车祸的那周
<29-7,BECKETT>That's the same week as Pamela Bonner's car accident.

746
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,290
<29-8,RYAN>没错  看看这个
<29-8,RYAN>Right. Now check it out.

749
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,910

751
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,540
<29-9,ESPOSITO>所以你认为他的一个客户可能涉案
<29-9,ESPOSITO>So you think one of his clients might have been involved?

752
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,740
<29-9,ESPOSITO>也许跟她撞车逃逸了
<29-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe ran her off the road?

753
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,310
<29-10,RYAN>据高速公路巡警所说  出事的是一辆车

754
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,730
<29-11,BECKETT>伙计们  如果艾丽卡是对的呢
<29-11,BECKETT>You guys, what if Erika was right?

755
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,150
<29-11,BECKETT>如果帕姆拉没有酒驾或是穿高跟鞋呢
<29-11,BECKETT>What if Pamela wasn't driving drunk or in her high heels?

756
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,990
<29-11,BECKETT>事实上  如果帕姆拉根本没有开车呢
<29-11,BECKETT>In fact, what if Pamela wasn't driving at all?

757
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,370
<29-12,ESPOSITO>开车的另有其人
<29-12,ESPOSITO>Someone else was driving,

758
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,470
<29-12,ESPOSITO>那个人撞了车
<29-12,ESPOSITO>Someone who crashed

759
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,000
<29-12,ESPOSITO>不想让帕姆的死归咎在自己身上
<29-12,ESPOSITO>and didn't want to be blamed for Pam's death.

760
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,330
<29-12,ESPOSITO>于是把她放在驾驶座上  逃逸了
<29-12,ESPOSITO>So he put her behind the wheel, fled the scene.

761
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,320
<29-13,BECKETT>然后打电话给律师
<29-13,BECKETT>And then called their lawyer.

762
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,900
<29-13,BECKETT>打给布雷洛克的是谁
<29-13,BECKETT>Who made that phone call to Blaylock?

763
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,140
<29-14,TORI>保密起见  律所用代码替换了用户姓名
<29-14,TORI>For security, the firm replaces its clients' names with codes.

764
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,610
<29-14,TORI>这位客户是47BGO
<29-14,TORI>This one's 47BGO.

765
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,730
<29-15,BECKETT>那家律所是不可能交出信息的
<29-15,BECKETT>Okay, that firm's never gonna give up that information.

766
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,480
<29-15,BECKETT>看看代码还有什么信息
<29-15,BECKETT>Let's see where else that code shows up.

767
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,250
<29-15,BECKETT>比照一下  看看能不能从中找到我们要的人
<29-15,BECKETT>Cross-reference it, see if we can I.D. our person from there.

768
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,980
<29-16,TORY>不会很费事
<29-16,TORY>You don't have to look too far.

769
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,890
<29-16,TORY>布雷洛克在车祸之后的第二天
<29-16,TORY>Blaylock billed that very same client

770
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,630
<29-16,TORY>让那个客户支付了一场高尔夫
<29-16,TORY>for a round of golf the day after the car crash.

771
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,300
<29-17,ESPOSITO>那对讨论细节来说是个好地方
<29-17,ESPOSITO>Well, that'd be a perfect place to discuss details.

772
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,070
<29-17,ESPOSITO>没有人能听到他们的话
<29-17,ESPOSITO>No one would over hear them.

773
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,430
<30-1,BECKETT>根据专卖店的发球员的说法
<30-1,BECKETT>So according to the starter at the pro shop,

774
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,880
<30-1,BECKETT>布雷洛克和另一个会员一起打了高尔夫
<30-1,BECKETT>Blaylock was playing golf with another member--

775
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,160
<30-1,BECKETT>科林·里格齐戴尔三世
<30-1,BECKETT>Colin Rigsdale III.

776
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
<30-2,RYAN>-里格齐戴尔政治家族的人  -对
<30-2,RYAN>- Of the Rigsdale political family? - Yeah.

777
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,000
<30-4,RYAN>据说他父亲准备让他参选州参议员
<30-4,RYAN>Word is daddy's grooming him for a state senate run.

778
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,300
<30-5,ESPOSITO>如果这件事传出来
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Not if this gets out.

779
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,150
<30-5,ESPOSITO>跟大学女生发生致命车祸
<30-5,ESPOSITO>A fatal car crash with a college chick?

780
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
<30-5,ESPOSITO>他的事业就完了
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Nah, he'd be done.

781
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,150
<30-6,BECKETT>所以他才要掩盖事实
<30-6,BECKETT>That's why he was covering it up.

782
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,950
<30-7,RYAN>布雷洛克帮了他  但后来又开始觉得内疚
<30-7,RYAN>With Blaylock's help until the guilt set in.

783
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,090
<30-8,BECKETT>然后艾丽卡开始做调查
<30-8,BECKETT>And then Erika started poking around,

784
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,060
<30-8,BECKETT>人们就开始死亡
<30-8,BECKETT>and people started dying.

785
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,080
<30-9,RYAN>这里说里格齐戴尔依然由班克斯·布尔律所代理
<30-9,RYAN>It says here Rigsdale's still represented by Banks and Bauer.

786
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,120
<30-10,BECKETT>给他们打个电话  告诉他们我要去
<30-10,BECKETT>Give 'em a call. Tell 'em I'm coming.

787
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,300
<30-11,ESPOSITO>好吧
<30-11,ESPOSITO>Right.

788
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,470
<30-12,RYAN>发生什么了  卡塞尔人呢
<30-12,RYAN>Hey, what's going on? Where's castle?

789
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,600
<30-13,ESPOSITO>别问
<30-13,ESPOSITO>Don't ask.

790
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,450
<31-1,BECKETT>多谢跟我见面  里格齐戴尔先生
<31-1,BECKETT>Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Rigsdale.

791
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,970
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>当杰西卡告诉我有人
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>Well, when Jessica told me someone

792
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,120
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>黑进了他们的系统时
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>had hacked into their system,

793
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,960
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>我当然很担心
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>I was, of course, concerned.

794
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,020
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>我想我们都知道我的政敌们
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>I think we all know what my political opponents might do

795
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,480
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>拿到了机密信息后会怎么做
<31-2,COLIN RIGSDALE III>if they managed to access confidential information.

796
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,040
<31-3,BANKS>那个黑进了我们系统的姑娘
<31-3,BANKS>So the girl who hacked into our system,

797
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,310
<31-3,BANKS>你们查出她在找什么了吗
<31-3,BANKS>did you find out what she was after?

798
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,320
<31-4,BECKETT>是的  我们也知道了她的死因
<31-4,BECKETT>Yes, and we also believe we know why she was killed.

799
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,390
<31-4,BECKETT>你知道一个叫帕姆拉·邦纳的女孩吗
<31-4,BECKETT>Are you familiar with a girl named Pamela Bonner?

800
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,700
<31-5,BANKS>探长  这是什么意思
<31-5,BANKS>Detective, what is this about?

801
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,340
<31-6,BECKETT>里格齐戴尔先生
<31-6,BECKETT>Mr. Rigsdale?

802
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,900
<31-7,RIGSDALE>这个名字我没听过
<31-7,RIGSDALE>The name's not familiar.

803
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,770
<31-8,BECKETT>真的吗  我了解到
<31-8,BECKETT>Really? I understand that

804
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,460
<31-8,BECKETT>她去年是这家公司的实习生
<31-8,BECKETT>she was an intern here at the firm last year.

805
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,810
<31-8,BECKETT>是这样吗
<31-8,BECKETT>Isn't that correct?

806
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,860
<31-8,BECKETT>你去年是不是参加了
<31-8,BECKETT>And isn't it also correct that you attended

807
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,960
<31-8,BECKETT>班克斯·布尔律所的夏季联谊会
<31-8,BECKETT>the Banks and Bauer summer associate party last year?

808
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,790
<31-9,BANKS>不要回答那个问题
<31-9,BANKS>Don't answer that.

809
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,270
<31-9,BANKS>探长  你在干什么
<31-9,BANKS>Detective, what are you doing?

810
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,910
<31-10,BECKETT>和我的被害人艾丽卡·阿尔布鲁克做同样的事
<31-10,BECKETT>The same thing that my victim Erika Albrook was doing,

811
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,900
<31-10,BECKETT>试着查出
<31-10,BECKETT>Trying to figure out

812
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,830
<31-10,BECKETT>她最好的朋友帕姆拉·邦纳的真正死因
<31-10,BECKETT>how her best friend Pamela Bonner actually died.

813
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,410
<31-11,BANKS>她的死是个意外
<31-11,BANKS>Her death was an accident.

814
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,240
<31-11,BANKS>真的吗
<31-11,BANKS>Really?

815
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,600
<31-12,BECKETT>那为什么我们有记录表明伊恩·布雷洛克
<31-12,BECKETT>Then why do we have a record of Ian Blaylock,

816
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,550
<31-12,BECKETT>里格齐戴尔先生那时的律师
<31-12,BECKETT>Mr. Rigsdale's attorney at the time,

817
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,370
<31-12,BECKETT>在那晚1点45接到了他的电话
<31-12,BECKETT>receiving a phone call from him at 1:45 that night?

818
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,100
<31-13,BANKS>探长  这是机密信息
<31-13,BANKS>Detective, this is privileged information.

819
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,220
<31-13,BANKS>不能作为证据
<31-13,BANKS>It's inadmissible.

820
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,580
<31-14,BECKETT>但我们不是在法庭上
<31-14,BECKETT>And we're not in court.

821
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,790
<31-15,BANKS>这次会面到此为止  你必须马上离开
<31-15,BANKS>This meeting is over. You need to leave. Now.

822
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,540
<32-1,CASTLE>告诉我  我该怎么相信她
<32-1,CASTLE>Just tell me, how am I supposed to trust her?

823
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,560
<32-1,CASTLE>我该怎么跟她维持这段关系
<32-1,CASTLE>How am I even supposed to-- to be in a relationship with her

824
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,610
<32-1,CASTLE>如果她不接纳我的话
<32-1,CASTLE>if she won't let me in?

825
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,350
<32-2,MARTHA RODGERS>好吧  理查德
<32-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Well, Richard--

826
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,690
<32-3,CASTLE>在我们一起经历了这么多之后
<32-3,CASTLE>After everything that we've been through together, I...

827
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,080
<32-3,CASTLE>我只是不明白
<32-3,CASTLE>I just don't understand.

828
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,060
<32-4,MARTHA>我不想这么说  孩子  但我得说
<32-4,MARTHA>I hate to say it, kiddo, but I do.

829
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,480
<32-4,MARTHA>事实就是
<32-4,MARTHA>Look, the truth is,

830
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,070
<32-4,MARTHA>凯瑟琳是个聪明又有抱负的女人
<32-4,MARTHA>Katherine is a bright, ambitious woman.

831
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,820
<32-4,MARTHA>她应该去参加那份工作的面试
<32-4,MARTHA>She should be interviewing for that job.

832
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,290
<32-5,CASTLE>你到底站在谁那边
<32-5,CASTLE>Whose side are you on?

833
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,770
<32-6,MARTHA>你想让她把你放在第一位
<32-6,MARTHA>You want her to put you first

834
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,360
<32-6,MARTHA>而你们都不知道
<32-6,MARTHA>when neither one of you know

835
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,830
<32-6,MARTHA>你们的关系会如何发展
<32-6,MARTHA>where the relationship is going.

836
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,480
<32-6,MARTHA>你知道这有多荒唐吗
<32-6,MARTHA>Do you know how absurd that is?

837
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
<32-6,MARTHA>我是说  这跟你不给
<32-6,MARTHA>I mean, that is as bad

838
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,380
<32-6,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯的项目支票签字一样糟
<32-6,MARTHA>as your not signing that check for Alexis' program.

839
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,860
<32-7,CASTLE>这事的关键不在我
<32-7,CASTLE>This isn't about me.

840
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,530
<32-7,CASTLE>你确定吗
<32-7,CASTLE>Are you sure?

841
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,710
<32-8,MARTHA>我了解你  你不会畏畏缩缩
<32-8,MARTHA>I know you. You do not hold back.

842
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,500
<32-8,MARTHA>除非
<32-8,MARTHA>Except...

843
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,910
<32-8,MARTHA>是你跟凯瑟琳的事
<32-8,MARTHA>This thing with Katherine.

844
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,360
<32-8,MARTHA>你花了差不多三年才告诉她你的感觉
<32-8,MARTHA>It took you, what, three years to tell her how you felt.

845
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,020
<32-8,MARTHA>又花了一年才采取行动
<32-8,MARTHA>Another year to act on it.

846
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,280
<32-8,MARTHA>现在  刚出现一点麻烦  你就想逃
<32-8,MARTHA>And now, first sign of trouble, you're ready to run.

847
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,480
<32-8,MARTHA>为什么
<32-8,MARTHA>Why?

848
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,570
<32-8,MARTHA>现在你们两个很开心
<32-8,MARTHA>Now you're having a good time, you both are,

849
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,260
<32-8,MARTHA>我知道你爱她
<32-8,MARTHA>And I know you say you love her,

850
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,780
<32-8,MARTHA>但是亲爱的  她就是这样的人
<32-8,MARTHA>But, darling, this is who she is.

851
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,580
<32-8,MARTHA>所以你有所保留的原因是不是
<32-8,MARTHA>So is it possible that the reason you have held back

852
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,710
<32-8,MARTHA>因为你内心深处觉得
<32-8,MARTHA>is because somewhere deep down inside

853
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,570
<32-8,MARTHA>你们的关系不会有结果
<32-8,MARTHA>you don't think this is gonna really work?

854
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,580
<33-1,ESPOSITO>我猜他没有招供
<33-1,ESPOSITO>I take it he didn't confess.

855
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,910
<33-2,BECKETT>我不需要他招供
<33-2,BECKETT>I didn't need him to.

856
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,710
<33-2,BECKETT>我只需要看看他的眼神就知道是他
<33-2,BECKETT>I just needed to see his eyes. It's him.

857
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,780
<33-3,RYAN>可证据不是这么说的
<33-3,RYAN>Well, the evidence begs to differ.

858
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,970
<33-3,RYAN>他的指纹在他十年前的一次
<33-3,RYAN>His prints are in the system

859
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,150
<33-3,RYAN>抗议行为中被捕后录入了系统
<33-3,RYAN>from his arrest at a political protest a decade ago.

860
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,260
<33-3,RYAN>我跟采到的指纹做了对比  不匹配
<33-3,RYAN>I ran 'em against the parti. It's not a match.

861
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,360
<33-3,RYAN>报纸上说在艾丽卡被杀的时候
<33-3,RYAN>And the papers put him at his family's compound in Maine

862
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,320
<33-3,RYAN>他在缅因州的家里
<33-3,RYAN>during Erika's murder.

863
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,970
<33-4,BECKETT>好吧  他不会亲自去干的
<33-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he'd never do this himself,

864
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,610
<33-4,BECKETT>但雇人去干对公众人物来说又太危险了
<33-4,BECKETT>And hiring someone else is too risky for a public figure.

865
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,270
<33-4,BECKETT>他应该会让一个亲近的人
<33-4,BECKETT>He'd... he'd get a close associate

866
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,550
<33-4,BECKETT>或一个他信任的朋友去干这事儿
<33-4,BECKETT>or a trusted friend to do it.

867
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,740
<33-4,BECKETT>我们查一下他的生活找出这个人吧
<33-4,BECKETT>So why don't we dig in to his life and find out who?

868
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,620
<33-5,BECKETT>好吧
<33-5,BECKETT>Right.

870
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,720
<33-5,BECKETT>探长
<33-5,BECKETT>Detective.

871
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,760
<33-6,FREEDMAN>给你打电话的是副主管安东尼·弗里曼
<33-6,FREEDMAN>Deputy director Anthony Freedman calling.

872
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,650
<33-6,FREEDMAN>你还记得吗  面试你的人
<33-6,FREEDMAN>You remember? From the interview.

873
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,770
<33-7,BECKETT>当然  先生  我记得
<33-7,BECKETT>Uh, yes, sir. Yes, I do.

874
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,270
<33-7,BECKETT>我能为你做什么吗
<33-7,BECKETT>Uh, what can I do for you?

875
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,240
<33-8,FREEDMAN>你可以说"好"
<33-8,FREEDMAN>You can say yes.

876
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,150
<33-8,FREEDMAN>探长  你得到了那份工作
<33-8,FREEDMAN>Detective, you got the job.

877
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,550
<34-1,RYAN>贝克特在哪
<34-1,RYAN>Hey, where's Beckett?

878
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,160
<34-2,ESPOSITO>她一小时前离开了
<34-2,ESPOSITO>She took off about an hour ago.

879
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,400
<34-2,ESPOSITO>肯定有事
<34-2,ESPOSITO>Something's going on,

880
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,510
<34-2,ESPOSITO>但她不肯告诉我是什么
<34-2,ESPOSITO>but she wouldn't tell me what.

881
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,120
<34-3,RYAN>我在调查里格齐戴尔的熟人的时候
<34-3,RYAN>Well, I was looking in to Rigsdale's known associates

882
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,610
<34-3,RYAN>发现了这张照片
<34-3,RYAN>and I came across this photo.

883
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,870
<34-3,RYAN>这是马丁·提利奇  里格齐戴尔同母异父的兄弟
<34-3,RYAN>That is Martin Tillage, Rigsdale's half brother

884
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,460
<34-3,RYAN>是家族的害群之马
<34-3,RYAN>and the black sheep of the family.

885
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,390
<34-3,RYAN>看起来眼熟吗
<34-3,RYAN>Look familiar?

886
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:48,390
<34-4,ESPOSITO>是  我们询问过这个人
<34-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we interviewed this guy.

887
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,810
<34-4,ESPOSITO>他是西德克的一位房客
<34-4,ESPOSITO>He was one of the guests at the Cedric.

888
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,010
<34-5,RYAN>他一定是为了找她而入住的
<34-5,RYAN>He must have checked in to try to find her

889
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,810
<34-5,RYAN>之后没急着离开
<34-5,RYAN>and then hung around

890
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,490
<34-5,RYAN>这样他就不会显得可疑
<34-5,RYAN>so his departure didn't look suspicious.

891
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,040
<34-5,RYAN>他肯定就是我们要找的人
<34-5,RYAN>He's gotta be our guy.

892
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,550
<34-6,ESPOSITO>我让警员把他带回来
<34-6,ESPOSITO>I'll have uniforms pick him up.

893
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,240
<34-6,ESPOSITO>-你去找找贝克特  -好
<34-6,ESPOSITO>- See if you can find Beckett. - Yeah.

894
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,490
<35-1,JIM BECKETT>听起来是个不错的机会
<35-1,JIM BECKETT>It sounds like a great offer.

895
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,940
<35-2,BECKETT>是  很不错
<35-2,BECKETT>Yeah, it is.

896
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,120
<35-3,JIM>你妈妈会为你感到骄傲的
<35-3,JIM>Your mom would be proud.

897
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,040
<35-3,JIM>天啊  我也为你骄傲
<35-3,JIM>Hell, I'm proud.

898
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,520
<35-4,JIM>那你打算怎么办
<35-4,JIM>So... what are you gonna do?

899
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,810
<35-5,BECKETT>我也不知道  爸爸
<35-5,BECKETT>I don't know, dad.

900
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,280
<35-5,BECKETT>我觉得自己就像站在一个十字路口
<35-5,BECKETT>It's like I'm standing at a crossroads

901
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,490
<35-5,BECKETT>两种未来  我必须二选一
<35-5,BECKETT>and I have to choose between two possible futures.

902
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,270
<35-6,JIM>你为什么觉得你必须选一种呢
<35-6,JIM>Why do you think you have to choose?

903
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,120
<35-7,BECKETT>因为他是对的  爸爸
<35-7,BECKETT>Because, dad, he's right.

904
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,350
<35-7,BECKETT>如果我选择这份工作
<35-7,BECKETT>If I take this job,

905
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,140
<35-7,BECKETT>我就会没有时间给任何人
<35-7,BECKETT>then there's not gonna be time for anyone else.

906
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,260
<35-7,BECKETT>如果我拒绝
<35-7,BECKETT>And then if I don't--

907
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,820
<35-8,JIM>那也是为了他
<35-8,JIM>It'll be because of him,

908
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,940
<35-8,JIM>你到最后也会为此怨他
<35-8,JIM>and you'll end up resenting him for it.

909
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,670
<35-8,JIM>或者  更糟
<35-8,JIM>Or... worse.

910
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,600
<35-9,BECKETT>爸爸  我不知道我们之间算什么
<35-9,BECKETT>Dad, I don't know what we have.

911
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,100
<35-9,BECKETT>我不知道那是不是真实的
<35-9,BECKETT>I don't know if it's... real.

912
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,970
<35-9,BECKETT>在过去的五年里
<35-9,BECKETT>It's like we've been doing this dance

913
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,310
<35-9,BECKETT>我们就像一直在跳舞
<35-9,BECKETT>for the past five years and...

914
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,470
<35-9,BECKETT>但是曲终了  又会发生什么
<35-9,BECKETT>I mean, what happens when the music stops?

915
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,250
<35-9,BECKETT>万一我们俩爱上只是这支舞呢
<35-9,BECKETT>What if all we were in love with was the dance?

916
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,050
<35-10,JIM>你知道  你这辈子
<35-10,JIM>You know, your whole life,

917
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,240
<35-10,JIM>从来没有一场感情走得这么远
<35-10,JIM>you've never had a relationship go this far.

918
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,150
<35-10,JIM>走到这个地步的时候
<35-10,JIM>You know, somewhere around here,

919
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,590
<35-10,JIM>你总是结束它
<35-10,JIM>you always end them.

920
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,280
<35-10,JIM>这是为什么呢
<35-10,JIM>Now why is that?

921
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,110
<35-10,JIM>听着  凯特  我了解你
<35-10,JIM>Look, Katie, I know you.

922
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,080
<35-10,JIM>当你害怕的时候
<35-10,JIM>When you get scared,

923
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,750
<35-10,JIM>你就拿工作当挡箭牌
<35-10,JIM>you hide in your work.

924
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,690
<35-10,JIM>我只是想让你确定
<35-10,JIM>And I just want you to be sure,

925
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,070

<35-10,JIM>whatever decision you make,

926
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,940
<35-10,JIM>是因为那是你想要的
<35-10,JIM>It's because it's what you want

927
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,840
<35-10,JIM>而不是因为你害怕了
<35-10,JIM>Not because you're afraid.

928
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,320
<35-11,BECKETT>这份工作
<35-11,BECKETT>This job...

<36-5,ALEXIS>你看起来有点伤心
<36-5,ALEXIS>You seem sad.

943
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,240
<36-6,CASTLE>没  我没事
<36-6,CASTLE>No, I'm fine.

944
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,200
<36-7,ALEXIS>只是哥斯达黎加而已
<36-7,ALEXIS>It's only Costa Rica.

945
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,590
<36-7,ALEXIS>我一眨眼的功夫就回来了
<36-7,ALEXIS>I'll be back before you know it.

946
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,840
<36-8,CASTLE>你真好  但是  不是因为这个
<36-8,CASTLE>Oh, that's--that's sweet, but, no, it's not about that.

947
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,220
<36-8,CASTLE>是
<36-8,CASTLE>It's, uh...

948
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,160
<36-8,CASTLE>因为你奶奶说的话
<36-8,CASTLE>something your grandmother told me.

949
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,640
<36-8,CASTLE>人生总会有一刻
<36-8,CASTLE>There comes a point in our lives

950
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
<36-8,CASTLE>我们必须停止自欺欺人
<36-8,CASTLE>when we have to stop fooling ourselves

951
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,740
<36-8,CASTLE>明白生活不会总依照我们的意愿发展
<36-8,CASTLE>into thinking life's gonna be the way we want it to be.

952
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,230
<36-8,CASTLE>开始认清现实的本来面目
<36-8,CASTLE>Start seeing things for how they really are.

953
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,140
<37-1,MARTIN>我确实在  那又怎样
<37-1,MARTIN>So I was there. So what?

954
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,270
<37-1,MARTIN>我需要个地方落脚待几晚
<37-1,MARTIN>I needed a place in the city to stay for couple of nights.

955
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,190
<37-1,MARTIN>这也算犯罪
<37-1,MARTIN>Is that a crime?

956
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,230
<37-2,BECKETT>不算  但是谋杀女孩就算了
<37-2,BECKETT>No, but killing a girl is.

957
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,910
<37-2,BECKETT>你兄弟答应你什么了  马丁
<37-2,BECKETT>What did your brother promise you, Martin--

958
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,100
<37-2,BECKETT>尊重你这个败家子
<37-2,BECKETT>Respectability for the black sheep,

959
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,650
<37-2,BECKETT>让你在家里有一席之地
<37-2,BECKETT>a place at the family table?

960
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,810
<37-3,MARTIN>我告诉过你了  我从没见过这个女孩
<37-3,MARTIN>I told you, I've never seen this girl before in my life.

961
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,430
<37-3,MARTIN>你在浪费你的时间
<37-3,MARTIN>You're wasting your time.

962
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,760
<37-4,BECKETT>你知道有多少人
<37-4,BECKETT>Do you have any idea how many people

963
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,150
<37-4,BECKETT>坐在桌子对面对我坦白自己的罪过吗
<37-4,BECKETT>have sat across that table and confessed their sins to me?

964
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,340
<37-4,BECKETT>你凭什么觉得自己比他们特别
<37-4,BECKETT>What makes you think that you're any different,

965
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,590
<37-4,BECKETT>比他们聪明
