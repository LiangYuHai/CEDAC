<1-16,CASTLE>You do know how this works, right?

41
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,910
<1-17,BECKETT>我得告诉你一件事
<1-17,BECKETT>There's something that I have to tell you.

<1-19,BECKETT>But this is my shot.

46
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,230
<1-19,BECKETT>如果我不抓住机会  我会后悔一辈子
<1-19,BECKETT>And if I don't do this, I'll always regret it.

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,880
<1-19,BECKETT>如果这让你有所改变
<1-19,BECKETT>Look, if this changes anything for you,

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,660
<1-19,BECKETT>如果这改变了你的想法
<1-19,BECKETT>if this changes the way that you feel--

49
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,900
<1-20,CASTLE>凯特  我向你求婚不是为了把你留在这
<1-20,CASTLE>Kate, I'm not proposing to you to keep you here

50
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,400
<1-20,CASTLE>也不是害怕会失去你
<1-20,CASTLE>or because I'm afraid I'm gonna lose you.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,080
<1-20,CASTLE>我求婚是因为我生命中不能没有你
<1-20,CASTLE>I'm proposing because I can't imagine my life without you.

<1-20,CASTLE>这意味着  如果遇到困难
<1-20,CASTLE>If that means when things get difficult,

<1-20,CASTLE>需要我们想办法解决
<1-20,CASTLE>we have to figure them out,

<1-20,CASTLE>assuming you're willing to figure them out with me.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,750
<1-21,BECKETT>那样的话

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,350
<1-23,CASTLE>不  是你的手指太纤细了
<1-23,CASTLE>No, you just have remarkably tiny fingers.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,890
<1-24,BECKETT>我们能解决这事的  对吧
<1-24,BECKETT>We're gonna be able to make this work, right?

<2-5,WOMAN>I'm fine.

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,230
<2-6,FEDERAL AGENT RACHEL MCCORD>贝克特
<2-6,FEDERAL AGENT RACHEL MCCORD>Beckett!

79
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,570
<2-7,MCCORD>贝克特探员
<2-7,MCCORD>Agent beckett?

80
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,540
<2-8,MCCORD>恭喜你
<2-8,MCCORD>Congratulations.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,080
<2-8,MCCORD>因为你  车臣人拿到了我们的核弹发射密码
<2-8,MCCORD>Because of you, the Chechens now have our nuclear launch codes.

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,160
<2-8,MCCORD>干得好
<2-8,MCCORD>Nice job.

83
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,930
<2-9,BECKETT>该死
<2-9,BECKETT>Damn it.

84
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,810
<3-1,MCCORD>人质没有挣扎  难道你不觉得奇怪吗
<3-1,MCCORD>You didn't find it odd that the hostage wasn't struggling?

85
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,770
<3-2,BECKETT>她的头被一把枪顶着
<3-2,BECKETT>She had a gun held to her head.

86
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,770
<3-3,MCCORD>而她没有呼救  为什么
<3-3,MCCORD>And she didn't cry out for help. Why?

87
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,040
<3-4,BECKETT>因为她不想暴露口音  好吧
<3-4,BECKETT>Because she didn't wanna give away her accent. Fine.

88
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,070
<3-4,BECKETT>但是情报说特务是单独行动的
<3-4,BECKETT>But the intel said that the operative worked alone.

89
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,650
<3-5,MCCORD>这就是演习的意义
<3-5,MCCORD>And that's the point of the exercise.

90
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,350
<3-5,MCCORD>情报有时候有误
<3-5,MCCORD>Intel is sometimes wrong.

91
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,870
<3-5,MCCORD>你得用自己的判断和直觉
<3-5,MCCORD>You have to use your judgment, your instinct,

92
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,180
<3-5,MCCORD>因为吃枪子儿的人
<3-5,MCCORD>because the analyst that's gathering that intel--

93
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,940
<3-5,MCCORD>不是收集情报的分析员
<3-5,MCCORD>he's not the one that's gonna be catching a bullet.

94
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,350
<3-5,MCCORD>而是你  或者更糟糕  是我
<3-5,MCCORD>That's gonna be you, or worse, me.

95
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,850
<3-5,MCCORD>加油吧
<3-5,MCCORD>Now step up your game.

<3-10,BECKETT>-我本该发现的  -你瞧
<3-10,BECKETT>- Should've seen it. - Hey, look,

101
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,780
<3-11,HENDRICKS>在训练中丧命总比实战中死去要好  对吧
<3-11,HENDRICKS>it's better to die in training than in the field, right?

102
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,240
<3-12,BECKETT>-不死最好了  -是啊
<3-12,BECKETT>- It's better not to die at all. - Yeah.

103
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,320
<3-13,HENDRICKS>今晚我们几个同事要出去喝一杯
<3-13,HENDRICKS>Listen, a few of us are grabbing a beer tonight.

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,170
<3-13,HENDRICKS>你要来吗
<3-13,HENDRICKS>You wanna join?

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,570

206
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,450
<8-5,CASTLE>这是你的案子吗
<8-5,CASTLE>Is this your case?

209
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,620
<8-8,BECKETT>这是机密
<8-8,BECKETT>It's classified.

210
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,810
<8-9,CASTLE>你知道这么说只会让我更好奇吧
<8-9,CASTLE>You do realize that only makes me more curious.

211
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,030
<8-9,CASTLE>是大案子吗
<8-9,CASTLE>So... is it big?

212
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,080
<8-10,BECKETT>你知道我不能跟你谈论公事
<8-10,BECKETT>You know I can't talk about it.

213
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,010
<8-11,CASTLE>不代表我不能猜啊
<8-11,CASTLE>Doesn't mean I can't guess.

214
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,080
<8-11,CASTLE>肯定是大案子  都害你取消了我们的约会
<8-11,CASTLE>It must be big. You had to cancel our weekend together.

215
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,790
<8-11,CASTLE>肯定是本地的案子  因为你还在这里
<8-11,CASTLE>Must be local, because you're still here.

216
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,010
<8-11,CASTLE>我肯定能猜中
<8-11,CASTLE>I bet I can figure this out.

217
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,810
<8-12,BECKETT>不代表你应该这么做啊
<8-12,BECKETT>Well, that doesn't mean that you should.

218
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,430
<8-13,CASTLE>别这样  难道你不怀念我们共事的时光吗
<8-13,CASTLE>Come on. Don't you miss working together?

219
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,820

220
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,360
<8-15,CASTLE>要是让我帮忙的话  也许能快点处理完
<8-15,CASTLE>So if I were to help you, maybe we could solve whatever...

221
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,570
<8-15,CASTLE>这个案子
<8-15,CASTLE>this is faster,

222
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,370
<8-15,CASTLE>然后整个周末过二人世界
<8-15,CASTLE>and then have the whole weekend to ourselves.

223
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,250

<9-3,ESPOSITO>It's gonna be a long four months.

264
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,580
<9-4,ESPOSITO>我是埃斯波西托
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Esposito.

265
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,070
<9-5,CASTLE>西托  是我
<9-5,CASTLE>'Sito! It's me.

266
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,150
<9-6,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  我把电话开免提
<9-6,ESPOSITO>Castle? I'll put you on speaker.

267
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,640
<9-7,ESPOSITO>你去哪儿了  兄弟
<9-7,ESPOSITO>So where you been, bro?

268
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,000
<9-7,ESPOSITO>你已经错过了三个光环游戏之夜
<9-7,ESPOSITO>You've missed, like, three "Halo" Nights.

269
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,170
<9-8,CASTLE>我跟你说了  我去巡回签售了
<9-8,CASTLE>I told you, I was on a book tour.

270
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,240
<9-9,RYAN>是吗  你有没有告诉你的书迷
<9-9,RYAN>Yeah? Did you tell your book groupies

271
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,640
<9-9,RYAN>你已经订婚了
<9-9,RYAN>you're engaged now?

272
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,230
<9-10,CASTLE>你在给娃娃包襁褓吧
<9-10,CASTLE>You're swaddling that doll right now, aren't you?

273
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,410
<9-11,ESPOSITO>听着  我们刚结束了一个案子
<9-11,ESPOSITO>So listen, we just finished a case.

274
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,460
<9-11,ESPOSITO>下班后来跟我们喝一杯吧
<9-11,ESPOSITO>Come have a drink with us after work.

275
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,980
<9-12,CASTLE>我很想去  但我正在忙自己的案子
<9-12,CASTLE>Oh, I'd love to, but I'm working on a case of my own right now...

276
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,390
<9-12,CASTLE>为了我的下一本书
<9-12,CASTLE>For my next book.

277
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,050
<9-13,ESPOSITO>所以你打电话
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Oh, so you just called us

278
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,120
<9-13,ESPOSITO>就是因为你需要专业技术顾问
<9-13,ESPOSITO>'cause you need some expert technical consulting.

279
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,160
<9-14,CASTLE>好吧  既然你主动提供了
<9-14,CASTLE>Well, s-since you offered.

280
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,320
<9-15,CASTLE>我在写一个关于
<9-15,CASTLE>I'm writing a scene about someone

281
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,440
<9-15,CASTLE>仅凭一张证据照片
<9-15,CASTLE>trying to investigate a crime

282
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,510
<9-15,CASTLE>调查案件的故事
<9-15,CASTLE>using only one evidence photo--

283
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,230
<9-15,CASTLE>一桩涉及国家安全的案件
<9-15,CASTLE>A crime involving national security.

284
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,880
<9-16,RYAN>所以你的主角是个间谍
<9-16,RYAN>So your hero's a spy?

285
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,460
<9-17,CASTLE>更像是个粗犷英俊的普通人
<9-17,CASTLE>More like a... ruggedly handsome everyman.

286
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,250
<9-17,CASTLE>不管怎样  照片里是个炸烂的变压器
<9-17,CASTLE>Anyway, the photo is of a blown transformer,

287
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,830
<9-17,CASTLE>所以我在网上随便找了张变压器的照片
<9-17,CASTLE>so I pulled a random photo of a transformer off the internet,

288
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,550
<9-17,CASTLE>上面有个序列号
<9-17,CASTLE>and there's a serial number on the side.

289
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,390
<9-17,CASTLE>我想试着看看
<9-17,CASTLE>I'm trying to determine how much

290
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,600
<9-17,CASTLE>我的主人公能通过这个号码发现多少
<9-17,CASTLE>my character could figure out just from that number.

291
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,010
<9-17,CASTLE>我在想我的主人公的
<9-17,CASTLE>I'm wondering if my character's

292
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,700
<9-17,CASTLE>警察朋友会不会有些资源
<9-17,CASTLE>police buddies might have any... resources.

293
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,820
<9-18,ESPOSITO>如果主人公的虚构警察朋友
<9-18,ESPOSITO>Well, if your hero's fictional cop buddies

294
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,790
<9-18,ESPOSITO>跟你真正的警察朋友一样的话
<9-18,ESPOSITO>are anything like your real cop buddies,

295
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,340
<9-18,ESPOSITO>他们还有真正的工作要做  所以
<9-18,ESPOSITO>then they'd have real work to get back to, so...

296
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,580
<9-18,ESPOSITO>-再见吧  -如果我们的主人公
<9-18,ESPOSITO>- Bye-bye now. - What if...

297
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,810
<9-19,CASTLE>能提供尼克斯队的场地票呢
<9-19,CASTLE>our hero was offering Knicks floor seats?

298
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,530
<9-20,ESPOSITO>那个序列号是多少
<9-20,ESPOSITO>What's that serial number?

299
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,470
<9-20,ESPOSITO>给
<9-20,ESPOSITO>Here.

300
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,920
<9-20,ESPOSITO>AP5739215
<9-20,ESPOSITO>A-P-5-7-3-9-2-1-5.

301
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,850
<10-1,TORY ELLIS>找到了  AP代表爱兰歌娜电力
<10-1,TORY ELLIS>Here we go. The "AP" Stands for Allegra Power.

303
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,770
<10-1,TORY ELLIS>他们为北弗吉尼亚供电
<10-1,TORY ELLIS>They service Northern Virginia.

304
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:15,180
<10-2,CASTLE>用那个号码能查到
<10-2,CASTLE>And would it be possible to trace the location

305
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,640
<10-2,CASTLE>变压器的位置吗
<10-2,CASTLE>of that transformer using that number?

306
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,890
<10-3,TORY>当然可以
<10-3,TORY>Yeah, sure.

307
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,590
<10-3,TORY>那个号码的变压器控制着
<10-3,TORY>The transformer with that serial number controls

308
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,870
<10-3,TORY>阿灵顿地区阿士顿高地
<10-3,TORY>a 10-square block region

309
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,180
<10-3,TORY>一块十平方英里的区域
<10-3,TORY>of the Ashton heights neighborhood in Arlington.

310
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,810
<10-4,CASTLE>谢了  伙计们  你们拯救了这个故事
<10-4,CASTLE>Thanks, you guys. You saved the story.

311
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,470
<10-5,TORY>伙计们  那个变压器
<10-5,TORY>Guys, that exact transformer

312
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,090
<10-5,TORY>事件: 爆炸破坏
<10-5,TORY>保密: 联邦调查中

313
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,400
<10-5,TORY>两天前被破坏了
<10-5,TORY>was sabotaged two nights ago,

314
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,590
<10-5,TORY>联邦探员正在调查
<10-5,TORY>And the feds are investigating.

315
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,310
<10-6,RYAN>阿灵顿  不是贝克特的辖区吗
<10-6,RYAN>Arlington? Isn't that Beckett's backyard?

316
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,890
<10-6,RYAN>卡塞尔
<10-6,RYAN>Castle.

317
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,210
<10-7,ESPOSITO>这是个真案子吧
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Is this a real case?

318
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,210
<10-8,CASTLE>其实  我  什么
<10-8,CASTLE>Well, actually, I-- what?

319
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,400
<10-8,CASTLE>隧道...  对...
<10-8,CASTLE>Tunnel... Right...

320
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,580
<10-8,CASTLE>等我...  有空...  打给你
<10-8,CASTLE>call... later... when I...

321
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,740
<10-8,CASTLE>拜...
<10-8,CASTLE>B...

322
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,610
<11-1,CASTLE>真机智
<11-1,CASTLE>Smooth.

323
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,790
<11-1,CASTLE>好吧
<11-1,CASTLE>All right.

325
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,060
<11-1,CASTLE>为什么要炸掉变压器呢
<11-1,CASTLE>Why would someone blow up a transformer?

326
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,520
<11-1,CASTLE>恐怖袭击
<11-1,CASTLE>Terrorism.

327
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,740
<11-1,CASTLE>不  那样新闻上会播的
<11-1,CASTLE>No, that would have been in the news.

328
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
<11-1,CASTLE>为了制造停电
<11-1,CASTLE>To cause a blackout?

329
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,790
<11-1,CASTLE>停电怎么会影响国家安全
<11-1,CASTLE>How does a blackout affect national security?

331
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,400
<11-1,CASTLE>停电暂时性地关闭了
<11-1,CASTLE>The blackout momentarily shut down

332
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,490
<11-1,CASTLE>赛博科技大楼的安保系统
<11-1,CASTLE>the Cybertech building security system.

334
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,050
<12-1,BECKETT>这个变压器供电
<12-1,BECKETT>Now this particular facility

335
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,870
<12-1,BECKETT>范围内有许多政府承包商
<12-1,BECKETT>houses a number of government contractors.

336
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,350
<12-1,BECKETT>其中一个是赛博科技
<12-1,BECKETT>One of them is Cybertech Transnational.

338
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,900
<12-2,MCCORD>有人进入了赛博科技的清洁室
<12-2,MCCORD>Someone gained access to Cybertech's clean room

339
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,980
<12-2,MCCORD>而且偷走了高度机密的硬件安全模块
<12-2,MCCORD>and stole a highly classified hardware security module.

340
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,680
<12-2,MCCORD>那个模块
<12-2,MCCORD>This is that module

341
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,350
<12-2,MCCORD>里面有军方卫星
<12-2,MCCORD>that contains the encryption system

342
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,210
<12-2,MCCORD>网络入口的加密系统
<12-2,MCCORD>that serves as the gateway to the military satellite network.

343
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,910
<12-3,BECKETT>拿走它的人
<12-3,BECKETT>Whoever took it is capable of shutting

344
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,990
<12-3,BECKETT>能够关掉整个卫星网络
<12-3,BECKETT>that satellite network down completely.

345
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,600
<12-4,MCCORD>这会导致大部分军方防御系统失效
<12-4,MCCORD>Leaving a large portion of our military's defenses blind.

346
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,990
<12-5,VILLANTE>我们对窃贼了解多少
<12-5,VILLANTE>What do we know about our thieves?

347
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,110
<12-6,MCCORD>不多  没有指纹  没有DNA的痕迹
<12-6,MCCORD>Not much. There's no prints, no trace D.N.A.

348
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,060
<12-6,MCCORD>但这是个很复杂的行动
<12-6,MCCORD>But it was a highly complex operation.

349
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,430
<12-7,BECKETT>所以我们认为罪犯
<12-7,BECKETT>So we believe whoever pulled this off

350
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,940
<12-7,BECKETT>一定经历过军事训练
<12-7,BECKETT>had to have had military training

351
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,100
<12-7,BECKETT>或者秘密行动
<12-7,BECKETT>or stealth ops.

352
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,980
<12-7,BECKETT>他们得炸掉变压器
<12-7,BECKETT>They had to blow up the transformer,

353
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,200
<12-7,BECKETT>停掉备用发电机
<12-7,BECKETT>disable the backup generators,

354
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,670
<12-7,BECKETT>然后从风井爬上去
<12-7,BECKETT>then climb up this air shaft.

355
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,630
<12-8,MCCORD>而且他们的速度得非常快
<12-8,MCCORD>And they had to do it all extremely quickly,

356
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,610
<12-8,MCCORD>因为即使停电让安保摄像头失效
<12-8,MCCORD>because even though the blackout defeated the security cameras,

357
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,950
<12-8,MCCORD>它们也会在五分钟后靠电池重启
<12-8,MCCORD>they reset on battery power five minutes later.

358
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,820
<12-9,VILLANTE>这样的行动不可能在五分钟内完成
<12-9,VILLANTE>There's no way this operation took less than five minutes.

359
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,700
<12-9,VILLANTE>录像一定拍到了他们离开的画面
<12-9,VILLANTE>We must have video footage of them leaving.

360
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,620
<12-10,HENDRICKS>不  长官  我们看了整个录像
<12-10,HENDRICKS>No, Sir. We scrubbed the entire video.

361
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,990
<12-10,HENDRICKS>什么都没有
<12-10,HENDRICKS>There's nothing.

362
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,210
<12-11,BECKETT>他们有可能还在楼里吗
<12-11,BECKETT>Could they still be in the building?

363
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,670
<12-12,HENDRICKS>不可能  除非已经死了
<12-12,HENDRICKS>No, not if they're alive.

364
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,920
<12-12,HENDRICKS>整个楼都用热成像扫描过  没发现有人
<12-12,HENDRICKS>A thermal imaging sweep of the entire premises came up negative.

365
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,550
<12-13,VILLANTE>他们一定是找到了一条
<12-13,VILLANTE>They must have found a way out

366
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,200
<12-13,VILLANTE>能避开摄像头的出路
<12-13,VILLANTE>that didn't take them past the cameras.

367
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,570
<12-14,HENDRICKS>没这样的路  长官
<12-14,HENDRICKS>There isn't one, sir.

368
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,180
<12-14,HENDRICKS>整个大楼外围都是百分之百监控的
<12-14,HENDRICKS>The outside of the building has 100% coverage.

369
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,050
<12-15,BECKETT>那楼底下呢
<12-15,BECKETT>What about under the building?

370
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,710
<12-16,MCCORD>底下
<12-16,MCCORD>Under it?

371
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,480
<12-17,BECKETT>常和敏感材料打交道的研究机构
<12-17,BECKETT>A research facility dealing with sensitive materials

372
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
<12-17,BECKETT>一定会有某种防洪设施
<12-17,BECKETT>would need to have some sort of flood controls.

373
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,170
<12-17,BECKETT>能把排水系统的图纸调出来吗
<12-17,BECKETT>Can you pull up a map of the drainage system myriad?

374
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,080
<12-18,MCCORD>-排水管就在大楼底下  -我们曾想到过
<12-18,MCCORD>- Drainage tunnels go right under the building. - We thought of that.

375
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,470
<12-19,HENDRICKS>我们排查过所有接入点
<12-19,HENDRICKS>We checked all the access points,

376
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,820
<12-19,HENDRICKS>包括排水口
<12-19,HENDRICKS>including the drainage grids.

377
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,360
<12-19,HENDRICKS>-它们都焊死了  -再查一遍
<12-19,HENDRICKS>- They're all welded shut. - Check 'em again.

378
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,420
<12-21,MCCORD>如果他们真是从地下走的
<12-21,MCCORD>If they did use the tunnels,

379
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,530
<12-21,MCCORD>他们不会跑太远
<12-21,MCCORD>they wouldn't have wanted to travel too far.

380
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,380
<12-21,MCCORD>所以他们会从附近一个
<12-21,MCCORD>So they'd need to access the drainage system

381
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,820
<12-21,MCCORD>夜晚无人使用的地方进入排水系统
<12-21,MCCORD>from a nearby area-- one that's inactive at night.

382
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,690
<12-21,MCCORD>就像...
<12-21,MCCORD>Like...

383
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,250
<12-22,BECKETT>这个高尔夫球场
<12-22,BECKETT>this golf course.

384
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,840
<13-1,MCCORD>谢谢
<13-1,MCCORD>Thanks.

385
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,950
<13-2,MCCORD>亨德里克斯从大楼打来电话
<13-2,MCCORD>That was Hendricks from the building.

386
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,270
<13-2,MCCORD>发现的确有人撬开了排水口
<13-2,MCCORD>Turns out someone did pry open the drain grate,

387
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,050
<13-2,MCCORD>出来后又重新焊上
<13-2,MCCORD>then welded it on the way out.

388
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,640
<13-2,MCCORD>你前途无量啊  贝克特
<13-2,MCCORD>There's hope for you, Beckett.

389
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,110
<13-3,BECKETT>至少我们知道我们找对路了
<13-3,BECKETT>Well, at least we know we're on the right track.

390
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,430
<13-3,BECKETT>打扰一下  联邦探员
<13-3,BECKETT>Excuse me. Federal agents.

391
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,440
<13-4,SECURITY GUARD>是关于昨晚断电的事吗
<13-4,SECURITY GUARD>Uh, is this about the blackout the other night?

392
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,610
<13-5,MCCORD>对  你怎么知道的
<13-5,MCCORD>Yeah. How did you know that?

393
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,960
<13-6,GUARD>就像我跟另一个人说的那样
<13-6,GUARD>Well, like I told the other guy,

394
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,680
<13-6,GUARD>我昨晚不在  你们应该找沃金斯聊聊
<13-6,GUARD>I wasn't here, so you'll have to talk to Watkins.

395
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,770
<13-7,MCCORD>什么另一个人
<13-7,MCCORD>What other guy?

396
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,940
<13-8,MCCORD>他到底在这里干什么
<13-8,MCCORD>What the hell is he doing here?

397
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,650
<14-1,MCCORD>-你跟他说什么了  -什么都没说
<14-1,MCCORD>- What did you tell him? - Nothing.

398
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,350
<14-3,MCCORD>贝克特  我知道他是你在纽约的搭档...
<14-3,MCCORD>Beckett, I know he was your partner in New York--

399
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,710
<14-4,BECKETT>不不  我发誓  我什么都没跟他说
<14-4,BECKETT>No, no, I swear. I didn't say anything to him.

400
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,140
<14-5,MCCORD>那他为什么在这里
<14-5,MCCORD>Then why is he here?

401
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,270
<14-5,MCCORD>贝克特探员
<14-5,MCCORD>Agent Beckett.

402
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,250
<14-6,CASTLE>麦考德探员
<14-6,CASTLE>Agent McCord.

403
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,760
<14-7,MCCORD>-你们在这里做什么  -你在这里做什么
<14-7,MCCORD>- What are you guys doing here? - What are you doing here?

404
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,970
<14-8,CASTLE>我是这么想的  既然贝克特要工作  我...
<14-8,CASTLE>Well, I figured since, uh, beckett was working, I'd--

405
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,810
<14-8,CASTLE>我就在这儿打几个球
<14-8,CASTLE>I'd just get in a few rounds.

406
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
<14-9,MCCORD>那你的球棍呢
<14-9,MCCORD>Where are your clubs?

407
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:09,780
<14-10,CASTLE>糟糕
<14-10,CASTLE>Crap.

408
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,470
<14-11,MCCORD>你知道如果我告诉长官
<14-11,MCCORD>Do you realize what would happen

409
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,930
<14-11,MCCORD>他在这里会有什么后果吗
<14-11,MCCORD>if I told the chief that he was here?

410
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,540
<14-11,MCCORD>你会被逐出团队
<14-11,MCCORD>You would be kicked off the team,

411
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,260
<14-11,MCCORD>更别说你还会面临妨碍公务罪的起诉
<14-11,MCCORD>not to mention obstruction charges against you.

412
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,930
<14-11,MCCORD>我就警告你这一次
<14-11,MCCORD>This is my one and only warning.

413
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,260
<14-11,MCCORD>下次再让我看到你  最好是在书壳上
<14-11,MCCORD>The next time I see you, it'd better be on a book jacket.

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,980
<14-12,CASTLE>好吧  别邀请她参加婚礼
<14-12,CASTLE>Okay, she is not invited to the wedding.

415
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,250
<14-13,BECKETT>"来打几个球"
<14-13,BECKETT>"Get in a few rounds"?

416
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,640
<14-14,CASTLE>你要我说什么  说你不小心把
<14-14,CASTLE>What did you want me to say, that you accidentally left out

417
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
<14-14,CASTLE>炸毁的变压器证物照落在家了吗
<14-14,CASTLE>your evidence photo of the blown transformer?

418
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,490
<14-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你居然看了我的机密证物照
<14-15,BECKETT>Castle, you went through my classified photos?

419
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,830
<14-15,BECKETT>-你到底在做什么  -想帮你
<14-15,BECKETT>- What the hell were you doing? - Trying to help.

420
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,320
<14-17,BECKETT>-我也没想到会被抓住  -是啊  逮个正着
<14-17,BECKETT>- I didn't think I'd get caught. - Yeah, well, you did.

421
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,330
<14-18,CASTLE>-是啊  -不过你是怎么来的
<14-18,CASTLE>- Yeah. - How'd you get here, anyway?

422
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,610
<14-19,BECKETT>我是说你为什么会来这里
<14-19,BECKETT>I mean, why are you here?

423
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,920
<14-20,CASTLE>那个变压器把我引到一个研究园区
<14-20,CASTLE>Well, the transformer led me to a research park

424
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,340
<14-20,CASTLE>那里的所有的租户都是政府承包商
<14-20,CASTLE>where all the tenants have government contracts.

425
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,020
<14-20,CASTLE>我猜他们可能是利用断电
<14-20,CASTLE>I figured maybe they're using the blackout

426
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,750
<14-20,CASTLE>来避开安保系统
<14-20,CASTLE>to circumvent the security system.

427
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,890
<14-20,CASTLE>但他们也不能大摇大摆地从正门进出
<14-20,CASTLE>But they're not just gonna waltz in through the front door.

428
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,970
<14-20,CASTLE>然后我就想起我们之前的案子
<14-20,CASTLE>Then I remembered that case we had at the old haunt,

429
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,660
<14-21,BECKETT>-凶手利用了...  -利用了纽约地下
<14-21,BECKETT>- where the killer used-- - Used the abandoned sewer tunnels

430
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,160
<14-21,BECKETT>废弃的下水管道  没错
<14-21,BECKETT>underneath New York. Yes.

431
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,430
<14-22,CASTLE>你也想到了
<14-22,CASTLE>You thought of it, too.

432
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,150
<14-23,BECKETT>但是  这里不是纽约
<14-23,BECKETT>Except... this isn't New York.

433
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,570
<14-23,BECKETT>你知道看一眼那张照片
<14-23,BECKETT>Do you realize how many laws were broken

434
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,070
<14-23,BECKETT>你要触犯多少条法律吗
<14-23,BECKETT>by looking at that photo?

435
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,960
<14-23,BECKETT>你是想害我被开除吗
<14-23,BECKETT>Are you trying to get me fired?

436
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,300
<14-24,CASTLE>这样会让我见你容易些
<14-24,CASTLE>Would make it easier to see you.

437
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
<14-25,BECKETT>要是我进监狱了也没用
<14-25,BECKETT>Not if I was in jail.

438
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,640
<14-26,CASTLE>也是
<14-26,CASTLE>Right.

439
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,860
<14-27,BECKETT>听着  我也想见你
<14-27,BECKETT>Look, I wanna see you, too,

440
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,430
<14-27,BECKETT>但我们不能这样  好吗
<14-27,BECKETT>But it can't be like this, okay?

441
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,350
<14-27,BECKETT>你得保证停止妨碍调查
<14-27,BECKETT>You have to promise you're gonna stop fiddling with this investigation.

442
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
<14-28,CASTLE>行  我保证
<14-28,CASTLE>Okay. Yeah. I promise.

443
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,350
<14-28,CASTLE>但你能不能至少听一听我的发现呢
<14-28,CASTLE>But wouldn't you at least like to hear what I found out?

444
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,790
<14-28,CASTLE>好吧
<14-28,CASTLE>Right.

445
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,200
<14-29,CASTLE>断电那晚  这些人什么都没有看见
<14-29,CASTLE>These guys didn't see anything the night of the blackout.

446
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,550
<14-29,CASTLE>因为太黑
<14-29,CASTLE>It was too dark.

447
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,830
<14-29,CASTLE>但那个保安
<14-29,CASTLE>But that guard over there

448
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,410
<14-29,CASTLE>记得在几天前见过一个人
<14-29,CASTLE>remembers seeing a guy a couple days ago

449
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,780
<18-4,CASTLE>开着一辆90年代末款的金色轿车
<18-4,CASTLE>in a late '90s model gold sedan.

450
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,570
<14-30,BECKETT>-他很可能是在做某种调查  -卡塞尔
<14-30,BECKETT>- He's probably doing some kind of recon. - Castle--

451
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,300
<14-31,CASTLE>-如果你让他们把监控录像送来...  -卡塞尔
<14-31,CASTLE>- If you have them send over their surveillance footage-- - Castle.

452
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,800
<14-32,BECKETT>卡塞尔  拜托
<14-32,BECKETT>Castle! Please.

453
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,830
<14-33,CASTLE>好吧
<14-33,CASTLE>Right.

454
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,970
<14-34,BECKETT>抱歉  好了  我退出  我不...  我保证
<14-34,BECKETT>Sorry. Okay. I'm out. I-I-I didn't--I promise.

455
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,760
<14-35,CASTLE>记忆清空
<14-35,CASTLE>Wiped from my brain.

456
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,020
<14-35,CASTLE>就像我从没来过
<14-35,CASTLE>Like I wasn't even here.

457
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,490
<14-35,CASTLE>-我得走了  -当然
<14-35,CASTLE>- I gotta go. - Of course.

458
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,180
<15-1,VILLANTE>能想到排水管非常好
<15-1,VILLANTE>Nice job with the drainage tunnel.

459
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,960
<15-1,VILLANTE>继续努力  贝克特
<15-1,VILLANTE>Keep up the good work, Beckett.

460
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,320
<15-1,VILLANTE>谢谢你
<15-1,VILLANTE>Thank you...

461
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,210
<15-2,BECKETT>没提卡塞尔的事
<15-2,BECKETT>For, uh, not saying anything about Castle.

462
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,730
<15-2,BECKETT>听着
<15-2,BECKETT>Look...

463
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,060
<15-3,MCCORD>我刚毕业的第一年
<15-3,MCCORD>When I was a year out of Quantico,

464
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,070
<15-3,MCCORD>我一心扑在案子上
<15-3,MCCORD>I was busting my ass on this case--

465
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,510
<15-3,MCCORD>我的第一个好机会
<15-3,MCCORD>my first big chance,

466
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,640
<15-3,MCCORD>我们跟了那个案子长达一个月
<15-3,MCCORD>and we'd been going at it straight for a month,

467
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,540
<15-3,MCCORD>我特别想释放些压力
<15-3,MCCORD>and I really wanted to let off some steam,

468
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,340
<15-3,MCCORD>于是我去了家酒吧  随便找了个男人
<15-3,MCCORD>so I went to a bar, and I picked up a guy,

469
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,560
<15-3,MCCORD>就把他带回了家
<15-3,MCCORD>and I took him home.

470
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,220
<15-3,MCCORD>第二天一早  他问我  斯科菲尔德是谁
<15-3,MCCORD>Next morning, he says, "Who's Scofield?"

471
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,350
<15-3,MCCORD>斯科菲尔德是我们这次高度机密调查的主角
<15-3,MCCORD>Scofield was the subject of our highly classified investigation.

472
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,250
<15-4,BECKETT>你睡觉的时候说了
<15-4,BECKETT>You talked in your sleep?

473
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,090
<15-5,MCCORD>这工作就这样  什么都可能发生
<15-5,MCCORD>It's this job. Things happen.

474
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,630
<15-5,MCCORD>你得确保下不为例
<15-5,MCCORD>You better make sure they only happen once.

475
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,210
<15-6,BECKETT>高尔夫球场的监控录像来了

<21-9,VILLANTE>你为什么在华盛顿  卡塞尔先生
<21-9,VILLANTE>Why are you in D.C., Mr. Castle?

582
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,620
<21-10,CASTLE>我来这里见未婚妻
<21-10,CASTLE>I'm here to see my fiancee.

583
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,710
<21-11,VILLANTE>但你为什么
<21-11,VILLANTE>But why did you choose

584
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,750
<21-11,VILLANTE>选在这周来见她呢
<21-11,VILLANTE>to see her on this particular weekend?

585
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,840
<21-11,VILLANTE>我...
<21-11,VILLANTE>Well, I...

586
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,010
<21-12,CASTLE>等等
<21-12,CASTLE>Oh, now wait a minute.

587
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,760
<21-12,CASTLE>你不会以为我跟这案子有关吧
<21-12,CASTLE>What, you don't think I'm involved in this, do you?

588
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,060
<21-12,CASTLE>听着
<21-12,CASTLE>Okay, look...

589
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,450
<21-13,CASTLE>那个男的在街上向我走来
<21-13,CASTLE>A man walked up to me on the street,

590
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,820
<21-13,CASTLE>用枪指着我  逼我坐进一辆车
<21-13,CASTLE>shoved a gun in my ribs and forced me into a car.

591
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,430
<21-13,CASTLE>之后他就开始审问我
<21-13,CASTLE>Then he started questioning me,

592
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,330
<21-13,CASTLE>你们知不知道他或是瓦尔基里
<21-13,CASTLE>whether or not you guys know about him or about Valkyrie.

593
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,570
<21-14,VILLANTE>-瓦尔基里  -对
<21-14,VILLANTE>-Valkyrie? -Yeah.

594
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,010
<21-14,VILLANTE>什么是瓦尔基里
<21-14,VILLANTE>What's Valkyrie?

595
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,590
<21-16,VILLANTE>我也不知道
<21-16,VILLANTE>I don't know!

596
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,930
<21-17,CASTLE>我告诉他我不知道
<21-17,CASTLE>I told him I didn't know,

597
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,690
<21-17,CASTLE>然后他就死了  就在车里
<21-17,CASTLE>and then he dropped dead right in the car.

598
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,010
<21-18,VILLANTE>莫名其妙  而你就坐在他旁边
<21-18,VILLANTE>Mysteriously? With you sitting next to him.

599
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,610
<22-1,MCCORD>没有  我们的数据库里
<22-1,MCCORD>No, there's nothing relevant about Valkyrie

600
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,070
<22-1,MCCORD>没有和瓦尔基里相关的信息
<22-1,MCCORD>in any of our databases.

601
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,860
<22-2,VILLANTE>可能是布朗森的联系人或者买家
<22-2,VILLANTE>It could be the name of Bronson's contact or buyer.

602
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,170
<22-2,VILLANTE>他们发现我们查到他  就除掉了他
<22-2,VILLANTE>They must have found out we were on to him and taken him out.

603
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,180
<22-3,MCCORD>这就意味着加密系统下落不明
<22-3,MCCORD>Which means the encryption system's in play.

604
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,850
<22-4,BECKETT>长官  我知道这看起来有蹊跷
<22-4,BECKETT>Sir, I know what this looks like,

605
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,790
<22-4,BECKETT>但是我发誓卡塞尔和这事无关
<22-4,BECKETT>but I swear to you, Castle's not involved in any of this.

606
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,960
<22-5,VILLANTE>我们知道
<22-5,VILLANTE>We know he isn't.

607
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,320
<22-5,VILLANTE>我们有自动提款机录像证明他是被劫持的
<22-5,VILLANTE>We have A.T.M. footage on him being abducted at gunpoint,

608
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,410
<22-5,VILLANTE>正如你所说
<22-5,VILLANTE>just like you said.

609
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,680
<22-6,BECKETT>那你为什么
<22-6,BECKETT>Well, then why did you--

610
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,300
<22-7,VILLANTE>我要确保他把知道的都告诉我们
<22-7,VILLANTE>I needed to make sure he told us everything he knew,

611
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,550
<22-7,VILLANTE>考虑到你未婚未的"光辉历史"
<22-7,VILLANTE>and given your fiance's history,

612
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,970
<22-7,VILLANTE>他需要彻底地明白
<22-7,VILLANTE>he needed to learn once and for all

613
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,880
<22-7,VILLANTE>不要去搀和联邦案件
<22-7,VILLANTE>to keep his nose out of federal business.

614
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,880
<22-8,VILLANTE>布朗森的死因有消息了么
<22-8,VILLANTE>Any word yet on how Bronson died?

615
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,300
<22-9,MCCORD>他们正在做尸检
<22-9,MCCORD>They're doing the autopsy right now.

616
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,180
<22-10,HENDRICKS>长官  我们有发现
<22-10,HENDRICKS>Sir, we've got something.

617
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,380
<22-11,BECKETT>-卡塞尔怎么办  -让他再担心受怕一会儿
<22-11,BECKETT>-Uh, what about Castle? -Let him sweat.

618
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,240
<22-11,BECKETT>对不住了
<22-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

619
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,810
<23-1,HENDRICKS>这是珍奈特·米勒 布朗森的女友
<23-1,HENDRICKS>So this is Jeanette Miller, Bronson's girlfriend

620
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,750
<23-1,HENDRICKS>极有可能是他的同伙
<23-1,HENDRICKS>and most likely his accomplice.

621
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,190
<23-1,HENDRICKS>他们交往了六个月
<23-1,HENDRICKS>Uh, they've been dating for six months.

622
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,130
<23-1,HENDRICKS>电话记录显示布朗森在劫持卡塞尔先生之前
<23-1,HENDRICKS>Phone records show that bronson called her

623
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,550
<23-1,HENDRICKS>给她打了好几次电话
<23-1,HENDRICKS>a number of times right before he abducted Mr. Castle,

624
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,120
<23-1,HENDRICKS>而且她曾是谢尔顿议员的助手
<23-1,HENDRICKS>and get this--she worked as an aide to Senator Shelton.

625
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,260
<23-2,BECKETT>谢尔顿是外交关系委员会的高官
<23-2,BECKETT>Shelton's a ranking member of the foreign relations committee.

626
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,760
<23-3,MCCORD>她有能帮助布朗森
<23-3,MCCORD>She'd have the connections to help Bronson

627
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,960
<23-3,MCCORD>将加密系统转移出国的通道
<23-3,MCCORD>move the encryption system out of the country.

628
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,650
<23-4,VILLANTE>她参与了这件事  找到她就找到了系统
<23-4,VILLANTE>She's part of this. Find her, you find that system.

629
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,740
<23-4,VILLANTE>知道她在哪吗
<23-4,VILLANTE>You have a location on her?

630
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,270
<23-5,HENDRICKS>我们追踪了她的手机GPS
<23-5,HENDRICKS>We tracked the G.P.S. on her phone

631
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,440
<23-5,HENDRICKS>位于罗斯蒙特的一条街上
<23-5,HENDRICKS>to a street in Rosemont,

632
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,870
<23-5,HENDRICKS>但当我们几分钟前行动时
<23-5,HENDRICKS>But when we moved in a few minutes ago,

633
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,790
<23-5,HENDRICKS>只发现了手机和车  都被丢弃了
<23-5,HENDRICKS>we found the phone and her car, both abandoned.

634
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,760
<23-6,MCCORD>她销声匿迹了
<23-6,MCCORD>She's off the grid.

635
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,280
<23-6,MCCORD>她知道我们在找她
<23-6,MCCORD>She knows we're looking for her.

636
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,070
<23-7,VILLANTE>我要你们监视这个城市的每个角落
<23-7,VILLANTE>I want every inch of this city under surveillance.

637
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,330
<23-7,VILLANTE>获取每条街道
<23-7,VILLANTE>You tap into every sidewalk,

638
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,160
<23-7,VILLANTE>交通和公共交通的监视录像
<23-7,VILLANTE>traffic and mass transit video feed.

639
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,150
<23-7,VILLANTE>用人脸识别系统以70%的匹配率查所有图像
<23-7,VILLANTE>Run everything through facial recognition with a 70% match.

640
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:43,900
<23-7,VILLANTE>她可能更改了她的外貌
<23-7,VILLANTE>She may have altered her appearance.

641
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,070
<23-7,VILLANTE>我要找到她
<23-7,VILLANTE>I want her found.

642
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,130
<23-8,MCCORD>明白  长官
<23-8,MCCORD>You got it, Sir.

643
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,320
<23-9,VILLANTE>等等  贝克特
<23-9,VILLANTE>Not you, Beckett.

644
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,310
<23-9,VILLANTE>我有事要找你谈
<23-9,VILLANTE>You and I have something else to discuss.

645
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,690
<24-1,CASTLE>告诉我这有比咖啡更有劲的东西
<24-1,CASTLE>Please tell me there's something stronger than coffee in there.

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,010
<24-2,BECKETT>抱歉了
<24-2,BECKETT>Sorry.

647
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,170
<24-3,CASTLE>我到底闯了多大的祸
<24-3,CASTLE>So... How much trouble am I in?

648
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,990
<24-4,BECKETT>没我闯的大
<24-4,BECKETT>Not as much as me.

649
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,620
<24-4,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔
<24-4,BECKETT>Look, Castle...

650
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,630
<24-5,CASTLE>我无法让一切回到从前  是不是
<24-5,CASTLE>I can't make it like it was before, can I?

651
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,730
<24-6,BECKETT>或许比以前更好呢
<24-6,BECKETT>Maybe it'll be better.

652
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,290
<24-6,BECKETT>这样一来  我们晚上回到家
<24-6,BECKETT>This way, when we come home at the end of each day,

653
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,710
<24-6,BECKETT>就有的聊了
<24-6,BECKETT>we'll have something to talk about,

654
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,160
<24-6,BECKETT>像普通的情侣一样
<24-6,BECKETT>like normal couples.

<24-7,CASTLE>Only your day will be classified.

656
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,870
<24-7,CASTLE>我们会找到平衡点的
<24-7,CASTLE>We're gonna make this work.

657
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,210
<24-8,BECKETT>我保证
<24-8,BECKETT>I promise.

<24-8,BECKETT>I'll have a couple of days off after this case,

659
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,780
<24-8,BECKETT>我们会找出法子的  但在这之前
<24-8,BECKETT>and--and we'll figure it out, but until then--

660

<25-12,CASTLE>你打算清理干净吗
<25-12,CASTLE>You are gonna clean all this up?

688

<25-12,CASTLE>C先生

<25-13,PI>in D.C. with your fiancee, did they?

<25-14,CASTLE>是的  派
<25-14,CASTLE>No, Pi. They did not.

692
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,790
<25-15,PI>有的时候  最好的方法
<25-15,PI>You know, sometimes the best thing to do...

693
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,300
<25-15,PI>就是谈谈
<25-15,PI>is talk about it.

694
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,790
<25-16,CASTLE>你说得太对了
<25-16,CASTLE>You know what? You're absolutely right.

695
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,940
<25-17,PI>你去哪
<25-17,PI>Where you goin'?

696
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,930
<25-18,CASTLE>我得找个人谈谈
<25-18,CASTLE>I'm going to find someone to talk about it with.

697
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,480
<26-1,MCCORD>找到布朗森女友了吗
<26-1,MCCORD>Any luck tracking down Bronson's girlfriend?

698
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,960
<26-2,BECKETT>还没
<26-2,BECKETT>Not yet.

699

<26-5,MCCORD>你想聊聊吗
<26-5,MCCORD>You wanna talk about it?

702
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,120
<26-6,BECKETT>不想
<26-6,BECKETT>No.

703
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,480
<26-6,BECKETT>很好
<26-6,BECKETT>Good.

<26-7,MCCORD>You get a hit?

705
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,740
<26-8,RICHMOND>不是完全匹配
<26-8,RICHMOND>Possible match. Uh...

706
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,250
<26-9,MCCORD>-87%的可能性  -放大看看
<26-9,MCCORD>- 87% certainty? - Bring it up.

707
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,550
<26-10,RICHMOND>这是交通摄像头的实时监控录像
<26-10,RICHMOND>This is traffic cam video, streaming live.

708
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,690
<26-11,BECKETT>她染了头发  不过应该就是她
<26-11,BECKETT>Well, she dyed her hair, but that's her.

709
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,570
<26-12,MCCORD>她肩上背的包
<26-12,MCCORD>And that bag on her shoulder...

710
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,060
<26-13,BECKETT>你认为里面装的是加密系统
<26-13,BECKETT>You think she's got the encryption system in it?

711
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,550
<26-14,MCCORD>查查就知道了
<26-14,MCCORD>Let's go find out.

712
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,190
<26-15,BECKETT>等会  她出画面了
<26-15,BECKETT>Wait. We're losing her.

713
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,700
<26-16,RICHMOND>转换摄像头
<26-16,RICHMOND>Switching feeds.

714
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,910
<26-16,RICHMOND>有了
<26-16,RICHMOND>There.

715
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,120
<26-17,MCCORD>这是哪
<26-17,MCCORD>Where is this?

716
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,860
<26-18,RICHMOND>20街和P接岔口  杜邦圈附近
<26-18,RICHMOND>20th and P, near Dupont Circle.

717
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,380
<26-19,MCCORD>我是麦考德  我们要追踪杜邦圈附近的一个目标
<26-19,MCCORD>This is McCord. We need to acquire a target near Dupont Circle.

718
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,920
<26-20,BECKETT>又出画面了
<26-20,BECKETT>We're losing her again.

720
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,440
<26-22,MCCORD>-她不见了  -里奇蒙德
<26-22,MCCORD>- She's gone. - Richmond.

721
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,850
<26-23,RICHMOND>她肯定是躲进了某家商店或是巷子里
<26-23,RICHMOND>She must have ducked into a store or alley.

722
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,990
<26-24,MCCORD>或是地铁  该死的  随时待命
<26-24,MCCORD>Or the metro. Damn it. Stand by.

723
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,780
<26-25,BECKETT>你能不能给我看一下她刚才走的路线
<26-25,BECKETT>Can you just display the route that she was following?

724
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,240
<26-26,RICHMOND>好的  正在分析她的路径
<26-26,RICHMOND>Okay. It's analyzing her path.

725
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,390
<26-27,BECKETT>她并没有选择最直接的路径
<26-27,BECKETT>It doesn't look like she's taking a direct route.

726
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,920
<26-27,BECKETT>她更像是在用躲避策略
<26-27,BECKETT>It's like she's using evasive tactics.

727
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,650
<26-27,BECKETT>如果她是从罗斯蒙特出发的话
<26-27,BECKETT>Okay, so if she started off in Rosemont...

728
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,660
<26-27,BECKETT>她行进的大致轨迹是朝着
<26-27,BECKETT>her general trajectory leads to...

729
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,840
<26-27,BECKETT>联合车站
<26-27,BECKETT>Union Station.

730
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,670
<26-28,MCCORD>她要逃跑
<26-28,MCCORD>She's making a run for it.

731
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,910
<27-1,RYAN>自从我和珍妮认识  我们俩分开的时间
<27-1,RYAN>You know, I don't think Jenny and I have been apart

732
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,910
<27-1,RYAN>就从来没有超过两天
<27-1,RYAN>for more than two days since we met.

733
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,950
<27-1,RYAN>你俩现在这样肯定很难熬
<27-1,RYAN>It's gotta be rough.

734
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,190
<27-2,CASTLE>我只是觉得我们都不同步了
<27-2,CASTLE>I just feel like we're so far out of synch.

735
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,930
<27-2,CASTLE>我不知道怎么才能回到之前的状态
<27-2,CASTLE>I don't know how to get back.

736
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,170
<27-2,CASTLE>我想我可能只是想找回原来的感觉
<27-2,CASTLE>Guess I was just...trying to make it feel like us again.

737
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,000
<27-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  包括拿我和莱恩当猴耍
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, by playing me and Ryan for chumps.

738
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,830
<27-3,ESPOSITO>你应该知道我们早晚会发现
<27-3,ESPOSITO>You should have known that we were gonna

739
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,290
<27-3,ESPOSITO>这个案子是真的
<27-3,ESPOSITO>figure out this case was real.

740
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,020
<27-4,CASTLE>因果报应
<27-4,CASTLE>Well, you'll be happy to know that for my sins,

741
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,730
<27-4,CASTLE>我被一个疯子拿枪劫持  还差点死掉
<27-4,CASTLE>I was abducted by a maniac at gunpoint and nearly killed,

742
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,610
<27-4,CASTLE>不过至少我没害得贝克特被炒鱿鱼
<27-4,CASTLE>but at least I didn't get Beckett fired.

743
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,740
<27-5,ESPOSITO>什么  劫持
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Whoa, whoa. Abducted?

744
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,850
<27-5,ESPOSITO>被谁
<27-5,ESPOSITO>By who?

745
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,630
<27-6,CASTLE>兄弟们  我真不能跟你们讨论这事
<27-6,CASTLE>Look, guys, I really shouldn't be talking about this.

746
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,570
<27-7,RYAN>拜托  卡塞尔  咱们谁跟谁呀
<27-7,RYAN>Come on, Castle. It's us.

747
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,850
<27-8,ESPOSITO>而且拜你所赐
<27-8,ESPOSITO>And thanks to you,

748
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,530
<27-8,ESPOSITO>我们已经身陷其中了
<27-8,ESPOSITO>we're already involved.

749
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,760
<27-9,CASTLE>好吧  但这事不能再牵扯别人了  明白吗
<27-9,CASTLE>Okay, but this goes no further, all right?

750
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,180
<27-9,CASTLE>我在街上走
<27-9,CASTLE>So I'm just walking down the street,

751
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,640
<27-9,CASTLE>突然间  他们要找的这个人
<27-9,CASTLE>and this guy that they're looking for

752
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,870
<27-9,CASTLE>冲出来抓住我  把我塞进车里
<27-9,CASTLE>grabs me, shoves me into a car,

753
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,640
<27-9,CASTLE>然后就开始胡言乱语  问我一堆问题
<27-9,CASTLE>starts talking crazy, asking all these questions.

754
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,330
<27-10,ESPOSITO>-什么问题  -什么什么瓦尔基里之类的
<27-10,ESPOSITO>- What kind of questions? - Something about Valkyrie,

755
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,070
<27-11,CASTLE>之后我以为他要晕倒
<27-11,CASTLE>and then I thought he was gonna pass out

756
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,910
<27-11,CASTLE>因为他一直说什么要去梦乡
<27-11,CASTLE>because he was talking about going off to dream world.

757
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,360
<27-11,CASTLE>但结果他没晕倒
<27-11,CASTLE>But he didn't pass out.

758
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,820
<27-11,CASTLE>他死了
<27-11,CASTLE>He dropped dead.

759
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,010
<27-12,ESPOSITO>这个家伙  他
<27-12,ESPOSITO>Uh, this guy -- was he, uh...

760
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,480
<27-12,ESPOSITO>他是军人吗
<27-12,ESPOSITO>was he military?

761
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,170
<27-13,CASTLE>怎么了  瓦尔基里是军事用语吗
<27-13,CASTLE>Why, is "Valkyrie" a military term?

762
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,280
<27-13,CASTLE>我不知道瓦尔基里是不是
<27-13,CASTLE>I don't know about "Valkyrie",

763
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,630
<27-14,ESPOSITO>但是"梦乡"
<27-14,ESPOSITO>but "dream world" --

764
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,430
<27-14,ESPOSITO>是位于波斯湾的高度机密特别行动基地
<27-14,ESPOSITO>it's a highly classified special operations base in the gulf.

765
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,290
<27-16,ESPOSITO>那是个幽灵基地
<27-16,ESPOSITO>It's a ghost base.

766
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,870
<27-14,ESPOSITO>政府从来不承认它的存在
<27-14,ESPOSITO>The government's never confirmed its existence,

767
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,460
<27-14,ESPOSITO>但是我
<27-14,ESPOSITO>but I...

768
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,470
<27-14,ESPOSITO>我认识一个人  他的一个朋友驻扎在那里
<27-14,ESPOSITO>I met a guy who knew a guy who was stationed there.

769
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,980
<27-15,CASTLE>基地在哪
<27-15,CASTLE>Where is it?

770
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,850
<27-16,ESPOSITO>我都说那是个幽灵基地了  卡塞尔
<27-16,ESPOSITO>I-it--it's a ghost base, Castle.

771
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,800
<27-16,ESPOSITO>你认为他会告诉我具体位置吗
<27-16,ESPOSITO>You think he's gonna say where it is?

772
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,700
<27-17,ESPOSITO>当然不会  但我可以告诉你
<27-17,ESPOSITO>No. But I will tell you this.

773
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,960
<27-17,ESPOSITO>如果贝克特的案子跟这个基地有联系
<27-17,ESPOSITO>If Beckett's case has anything to do with this base,

774
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,810
<27-17,ESPOSITO>那她要对付的问题可比她想象的要大得多
<27-17,ESPOSITO>Well, then she's into something way bigger than she realizes.

775
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,320
<28-1,BECKETT>在那
<28-1,BECKETT>There.

776
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,700
<28-2,MCCORD>目标正前往夹层楼面  准备逮捕
<28-2,MCCORD>Target is moving to the mezzanine. Close in.

777
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,280
<28-3,BECKETT>-不  等一下  别着急  -待命
<28-3,BECKETT>- No, wait. Not yet. - Stand by.

778
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,600
<28-4,MCCORD>你想让她上火车吗
<28-4,MCCORD>Would you like her to catch a train?

779
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,640
<28-5,BECKETT>我觉得不对劲
<28-5,BECKETT>No, something else is going on.

780
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,750
<28-5,BECKETT>她把她的车丢在了罗斯蒙特
<28-5,BECKETT>She abandoned her car in Rosemont,

781
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,950
<28-5,BECKETT>然后大老远地跑到这里来
<28-5,BECKETT>and then she came all the way out here?

782
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,870
<28-6,MCCORD>也许她以为自己被人跟踪了
<28-6,MCCORD>Maybe she thought she was being followed.

783
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,810
<28-7,BECKETT>那她为什么不在亚历山德里亚上火车呢
<28-7,BECKETT>Then why didn't she just hop the train in Alexandria?

784
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,340
<28-8,MCCORD>也许她想坐的那条线从这里发车呢
<28-8,MCCORD>Maybe the line she wants only leaves from here.

785
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,760
<28-9,BECKETT>又或者她是要来这里见她的买家
<28-9,BECKETT>Or maybe she's meeting her buyer here.

786
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,670
<28-9,BECKETT>是你教我要跟随自己的直觉的
<28-9,BECKETT>You're the one that told me to follow my instincts,

787
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,710
<28-9,BECKETT>我的直觉告诉我  我们应该等
<28-9,BECKETT>and my instincts say that we should wait.

788
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,750
<28-9,BECKETT>联合车站全楼禁烟
<28-9,BECKETT>Union Station is a nonsmoking building...

789
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,010
<28-10,MCCORD>我给你的直觉两分钟
<28-10,MCCORD>I'll give your instincts two minutes.

790
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,430
<28-10,MCCORD>原地待命
<28-10,MCCORD>Hold position.

791
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,070
<29-1,MCCORD>她人呢  她跑哪去了
<29-1,MCCORD>Where is she? Where did she go?

792
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,420
<29-2,MCCORD>我就知道我们不该等
<29-2,MCCORD>I knew it. I knew we shouldn't have done this.

793
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,400
<29-3,BECKETT>不  她在储物柜那边
<29-3,BECKETT>No, by the lockers.

794
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,910
<29-4,BECKETT>珍奈特·米勒  我们是联邦探员  你被捕了
<29-4,BECKETT>Jeanette Miller. Federal agents. You're under arrest.

795
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,230
<29-6,MCCORD>-什么  -不要引起骚动
<29-6,MCCORD>- What? - Let's do this quietly.

796
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,210
<29-7,BECKETT>-站到一边去  -什么  我干什么了
<29-7,BECKETT>- Step away. - What? What did I do?

797
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,580
<30-1,JEANETTE>我已经告诉过你们了
<30-1,JEANETTE>Look, I told you,

798
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,340
<30-1,JEANETTE>我这辈子就没见过这个东西
<30-1,JEANETTE>I have never seen this before in my life.

799
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,870
<30-2,MCCORD>那它怎么会在那个储物柜里呢
<30-2,MCCORD>Then what was it doing in that locker?

800
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,790
<30-3,BECKETT>走私政府财产
<30-3,BECKETT>Trafficking government property,

801
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,500
<30-3,BECKETT>妨碍国家安全  叛国
<30-3,BECKETT>jeopardizing national security, treason --

802
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,580
<30-3,BECKETT>每一项罪名都够判你终身监禁的了
<30-3,BECKETT>each one is punishable by life imprisonment.

803
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,920
<30-4,MCCORD>或是死刑  你的计划到底是什么
<30-4,MCCORD>Or worse. What was the plan, anyway?

804
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,000
<30-4,MCCORD>有人雇你和杰克·布朗森去偷的吗
<30-4,MCCORD>Did someone hire you and Jack Bronson to steal it?

805
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,110
<30-5,JEANETTE>你们不明白  事情没有这么简单
<30-5,JEANETTE>You don't understand. This isn't how it looks.

806
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,220
<30-6,MCCORD>是吗  你可是扔了你的手机
<30-6,MCCORD>Really? Because you dumped your phone,

807
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,700
<30-6,MCCORD>弃了你的车  还染了头发
<30-6,MCCORD>and then you dumped your car and you dyed your hair.

808
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,810
<30-7,BECKETT>很显然你想要人间蒸发
<30-7,BECKETT>Clearly you're trying to disappear.

809
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,540
<30-8,JEANETTE>因为杰克惹上麻烦了  他被人陷害了  我也是
<30-8,JEANETTE>Because Jack was in trouble. He's being set up. We both are.

810
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,580
<30-9,BECKETT>-珍奈特  -听我说
<30-9,BECKETT>- Jeanette -- - Listen.

811
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,590
<30-10,JEANETTE>他两天前的夜里接到了一个电话
<30-10,JEANETTE>He got a call a couple of nights ago --

812
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,910
<30-10,JEANETTE>有人约他在高尔夫球场见面
<30-10,JEANETTE>someone wanting to meet him at a golf course.

813
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,270
<30-10,JEANETTE>我不知道他们说了什么  但杰克吓坏了
<30-10,JEANETTE>And whatever they said freaked Jack out,

814
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,600
<30-10,JEANETTE>于是他就去了  但是约他的人一直没有出现
<30-10,JEANETTE>so he went out there, but the guy never showed.

815
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,090
<30-10,JEANETTE>当他听说入室盗窃案后
<30-10,JEANETTE>And then when he heard about the break-in,

816
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,010
<30-10,JEANETTE>他意识到他们给他设了套
<30-10,JEANETTE>he realized they'd set him up.

817
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,760
<30-11,MCCORD>-谁  -他不知道
<30-11,MCCORD>- Who? - He didn't know.

818
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,830
<30-12,JEANETTE>但杰克很害怕  他从未这样过
<30-12,JEANETTE>But Jack was scared, and Jack does not get scared.

819
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,450
<30-12,JEANETTE>他说我们得跑路
<30-12,JEANETTE>And he said that we needed to go on the run

820
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,700
<30-12,JEANETTE>直到他弄清发生了什么
<30-12,JEANETTE>until he could figure out what was going on.

821
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,440
<30-12,JEANETTE>他让我去找他在联合车站的储物柜
<30-12,JEANETTE>And he told me to go to his locker at Union Station,

822
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,180
<30-12,JEANETTE>里面放着钱
<30-12,JEANETTE>that there'd be money there...

823
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,110
<30-12,JEANETTE>他会尽快和我见面
<30-12,JEANETTE>and he'd meet up with me when he could.

824
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,140
<30-13,BECKETT>如果他没参与
<30-13,BECKETT>Okay, if he wasn't involved,

825
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,100
<30-13,BECKETT>那模块是怎么出现在他储物柜的
<30-13,BECKETT>then how did that end up in his locker?

826
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,180
<30-14,JEANETTE>我不知道  也许是陷害的一部分
<30-14,JEANETTE>I don't know. Maybe it's part of the setup.

827
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,300
<30-16,JEANETTE>瓦尔基里是什么
<30-16,JEANETTE>What's Valkyrie?

828
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:43,030
<30-17,MCCORD>-瓦尔基里  -关于瓦尔基里  杰克跟你说了什么
<30-17,MCCORD>- Valkyrie? - What did Jack tell you about Valkyrie?

829
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:48,290
<30-18,JEANETTE>杰克在哪儿  你知道他在哪吗
<30-18,JEANETTE>Look, where is Jack? Do you know where he is?

830
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,740
<30-19,JEANETTE>不
<30-19,JEANETTE>Oh, no.

831
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,560
<31-1,MCCORD>她有加密系统
<31-1,MCCORD>She had the encryption system.

832
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,510
<31-1,MCCORD>还有海外关系网
<31-1,MCCORD>she had the overseas contacts,

833
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,660
<31-1,MCCORD>她干了这么多事
<31-1,MCCORD>and yet after everything she did,

834
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,160
<31-1,MCCORD>还指望我们相信她是无辜的吗
<31-1,MCCORD>she really expects us to believe she wasn't involved?

835
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,800
<31-2,BECKETT>为了爱  人会干疯狂的事
<31-2,BECKETT>Well, people do crazy things when they're in love.

836
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,530
<31-3,MCCORD>我注意到了
<31-3,MCCORD>I noticed.

837
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,500
<31-3,MCCORD>别告诉我你相信她
<31-3,MCCORD>Don't tell me you believe her.

838
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,730
<31-4,BECKETT>她说得对  布朗森是被陷害的
<31-4,BECKETT>Well, she's right. Bronson was being set up.

839
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,250
<31-5,MCCORD>-你为什么这么想  -他公寓里的工具
<31-5,MCCORD>- And why do you think that? - The tools in his apartment,

840
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,210
<31-6,BECKETT>高尔夫球场的监控录像
<31-6,BECKETT>the security footage from the golf course,

841
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,650
<31-6,BECKETT>甚至他储物柜里的加密系统
<31-6,BECKETT>even the encryption system in his locker--

842
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,580
<31-6,BECKETT>像他这种受过训练的人不会如此低级
<31-6,BECKETT>someone with his training wouldn't be that sloppy.

843
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,750
<31-7,MCCORD>你觉得这份工作最难的地方是什么吗
<31-7,MCCORD>You know what the hardest thing about this job is?

844
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,260
<31-8,BECKETT>-什么  -知道什么叫适可而止
<31-8,BECKETT>- What? - Knowing when to stop doing this job.

845
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,120
<31-9,MCCORD>我们拿到了加密系统
<31-9,MCCORD>We have the encryption system.

846
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
<31-9,MCCORD>抓到了坏人  这就是胜利
<31-9,MCCORD>We got the bad guy. This is a victory.

847
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,090
<31-10,BECKETT>在火车站我没错
<31-10,BECKETT>I wasn't wrong in the train station,

848
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,950
<31-10,BECKETT>现在我也没错
<31-10,BECKETT>and I'm not wrong here.

849
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,690
<31-10,BECKETT>还有我们忽略的地方
<31-10,BECKETT>There is something that we're missing.

850
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,970
<31-10,BECKETT>好吧
<31-10,BECKETT>Okay.

851
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,840
<31-11,MCCORD>就算有人陷害了布朗森
<31-11,MCCORD>Let's just say someone did have it out for Bronson.

852
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,820
<31-11,MCCORD>他们为什么费这么大力气
<31-11,MCCORD>Why would they go through all the effort

853
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,920
<31-11,MCCORD>精心策划了一场停电
<31-11,MCCORD>to orchestrate a blackout,

854
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,050
<31-11,MCCORD>入侵政府秘密工厂
<31-11,MCCORD>break into a secure government facility,

855
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,590
<31-11,MCCORD>只为偷一个我们注定会追回的东西
<31-11,MCCORD>only to steal something that they knew we'd recover?

856
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,690
<31-11,MCCORD>陷害一个人用不着这么麻烦
<31-11,MCCORD>There are many easier ways to set someone up.

857
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,300
<31-12,BECKETT>等等  你说得对
<31-12,BECKETT>Wait. I mean, you're right.

858
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,760
<31-12,BECKETT>为什么要费这么大劲
<31-12,BECKETT>Why would someone go through all the trouble

859
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,750
<31-12,BECKETT>去偷一个我们注定能追回的东西
<31-12,BECKETT>to steal something just so that we would recover it?

860
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,040
<31-12,BECKETT>除非是为了转移我们的注意
<31-12,BECKETT>Unless it was a diversion.

861
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,740
<31-12,BECKETT>如果说他们要找的
<31-12,BECKETT>What if it wasn't the encryption system

862
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,480
<31-12,BECKETT>不是机密系统呢
<31-12,BECKETT>that they were really after?

864
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,390
<31-13,MCCORD>他们只想让我们认为这是他们想要的
<31-13,MCCORD>They just wanted us to think that that's what they were after.

865
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,760
<31-14,BECKETT>他们既然能从通风井进入赛博科技
<31-14,BECKETT>And the air shaft that they used to access Cybertech--

866
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,290
<31-14,BECKETT>他们就能进入同一栋楼的
<31-14,BECKETT>they could have used that to access any of the floors

867
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,410
<31-14,BECKETT>任何楼层
<31-14,BECKETT>in that same building.

868
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,090
<31-15,MCCORD>赛博科技是在三层和四层
<31-15,MCCORD>Cybertech is on floors 3 and 4.

869
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,520
<31-16,BECKETT>是的
<31-16,BECKETT>Right, and...

870
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,890
<31-16,BECKETT>五层和六层是一个基因实验室
<31-16,BECKETT>5 and 6 are a genetics lab.

872
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,820
<31-16,BECKETT>八层
<31-16,BECKETT>and 8...

873
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,110
<31-17,BECKETT>没有八层租户的详细信息
<31-17,BECKETT>There are no details about the tenant on 8.

874
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,210
<31-17,BECKETT>显示为机密
<31-17,BECKETT>It says it's classified.

875
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,490
<31-17,BECKETT>八层有什么
<31-17,BECKETT>What's on 8?

876

<33-1,CASTLE>发生什么了  为什么没人跟我说
<33-1,CASTLE>What's going on? Why won't anyone talk to me?

903
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,460
<33-1,CASTLE>他们为什么要抽我的血
<33-1,CASTLE>And why would they take my blood?

904
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,820
<33-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你知道我调查的那个案子
<33-2,BECKETT>Castle, you know that case that I've been investigating?

905
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,100
<33-2,BECKETT>入室盗窃案
<33-2,BECKETT>The, um, the break-in and the theft?

906
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,890
<33-3,BECKETT>其实它另有隐情
<33-3,BECKETT>Well, it turns out there's more to it than we thought.

907
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,010
<33-3,BECKETT>你是打算对我用水刑吗
<33-3,BECKETT>Are you gonna waterboard me?

908
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,850
<33-4,CASTLE>那会严重影响我们之间的感情
<33-4,CASTLE>Because that would seriously affect our relationship.

909
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,360
<33-5,BECKETT>不  亲爱的  你听我说
<33-5,BECKETT>No, babe, can-- can you listen for a second?

910
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,180
<33-6,BECKETT>我们发现同一栋楼的另一家实验室
<33-6,BECKETT>It turns out that something else was stolen from another lab

911
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,730
<33-6,BECKETT>丢了别的东西
<33-6,BECKETT>in that building.

912
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,660
<33-6,BECKETT>是他们为军队研发的
<33-6,BECKETT>It was a chemical agent that they were working on

913
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,040
<33-6,BECKETT>一种化学试剂  被认为太危险不能投产
<33-6,BECKETT>for the military, but it was deemed to dangerous to use.

914
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,990
<33-6,BECKETT>丢失的计量足以杀死几千人
<33-6,BECKETT>The amount stolen was enough to kill thousands of people.

915
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,350
<33-7,CASTLE>这种事情应该不用告诉我吧
<33-7,CASTLE>Isn't this "need-to-know" stuff?

916
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,310
<33-7,CASTLE>你为什么要告诉我
<33-7,CASTLE>Why are you telling me?

917
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,480
<33-8,BECKETT>因为这种毒剂杀死了杰克·布朗森
<33-8,BECKETT>Because that toxin was used to kill Jack Bronson,

918
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,450
<33-8,BECKETT>那个劫持你的人
<33-8,BECKETT>the man that abducted you.

919
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,240
<33-8,BECKETT>毒剂是雾化状态的
<33-8,BECKETT>It was aerosolized.

920
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,290
<33-8,BECKETT>它被放置在他汽车的通风装置中
<33-8,BECKETT>It was placed in the ventilation system of his car.

921
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,700
<33-9,CASTLE>我在那辆车里待过
<33-9,CASTLE>I was in that car.

922
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,310
<33-10,CASTLE>我是不是
<33-10,CASTLE>Was I...

923
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,050
<33-11,CASTLE>有多严重
<33-11,CASTLE>How bad?

924
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,120
<33-12,BECKETT>根据它在你血液中的含量
<33-12,BECKETT>Based on the amount found in your bloodstream,

925
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,910
<33-12,BECKETT>你只剩不到一天的生命
<33-12,BECKETT>you have less than a day to live.
