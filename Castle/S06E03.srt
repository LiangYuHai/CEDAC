54
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,070
<4-4,CASTLE>或许我该去表个态
<4-4,CASTLE>Maybe I should just put my foot down,

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,770
<4-4,CASTLE>让她明白我有多反对
<4-4,CASTLE>show her my stern disapproval.

57
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,120

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,280
<5-21,CASTLE>你们不会注意到我的存在的
<5-21,CASTLE>You won't even know I'm here.

120
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,210
<6-1,CASTLE>过气情景喜剧明星挂在钩子上
<6-1,CASTLE>A washed-up sitcom star dangling from a hook?

121
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,300
<6-1,CASTLE>还有比这更好的吗
<6-1,CASTLE>Does it get any better?

122
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,760
<6-2,RYAN>我小时候还一直看这部剧呢
<6-2,RYAN>I grew up watching that show.

123
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,300
<6-2,RYAN>查理·雷诺兹是极度被低估的演员
<6-2,RYAN>Charlie Reynolds is highly underrated as an actor.

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,370
<6-2,RYAN>《跩哥不上学》是永恒的经典
<6-2,RYAN>"2 Cool For School" is a timeless gem.

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,330
<6-3,ESPOSITO>这我深表怀疑  虽然我并没看过
<6-3,ESPOSITO>I seriously doubt that. Not that I've ever watched it.

126
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,510
<6-4,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>卡塞尔先生  你又回来了
<6-4,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>Mr. Castle, you're back.

127
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,450
<6-4,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>但是并不受欢迎
<6-4,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>But not by popular demand.

128
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,300
<6-5,CASTLE>见到你也很高兴  帕穆特
<6-5,CASTLE>Good to see you, too, Perlmutter.

129
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,560
<6-6,RYAN>能确定死亡时间了吗
<6-6,RYAN>Do you have a time of death for us?

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,650
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>晚7点到凌晨2点之间
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>Uh, between 7:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

131
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,480
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>死因不言而喻  他从屋顶坠落下来
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>The cause is obvious. He plummeted off the roof

132
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,490
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>插死在钩子上
<6-7,PERLMUTTER>and landed on the hook.

133
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,810
<6-8,ESPOSITO>会是自杀吗
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Possible suicide?

134
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,830
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>从起重机跟大楼之间的距离
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>Based on the crane's distance from the building

135
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,040
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>以及楼顶的打斗痕迹来看
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>and signs of struggle on the roof...

136
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,200
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>他是被人推下去的
<6-9,PERLMUTTER>He was pushed.

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,790
<6-10,CASTLE>查理·雷诺兹为什么要跑到屋顶上去
<6-10,CASTLE>What was Charlie Reynolds doing on the roof in the first place?

138
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,470
<6-11,RYAN>好问题
<6-11,RYAN>That's a good question.

139
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,360
<6-11,RYAN>这栋楼里有间公寓是他的  但他不住这儿
<6-11,RYAN>He actually owns an apartment in the building, but he wasn't living here.

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,940
<6-11,RYAN>这里都被拆得干干净净了
<6-11,RYAN>Every unit's been stripped down to the studs,

141
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,370
<6-11,RYAN>所以他住在一栋转租房里
<6-11,RYAN>so he was staying in a sublet.

142
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,560
<6-12,CASTLE>他有什么亲人吗
<6-12,CASTLE>Any family or next of kin?

143
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,810
<6-13,RYAN>在电视剧里有  但现实生活中就没有了
<6-13,RYAN>On the tv show, yes. In real life, not so much.

144
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,270
<6-14,ESPOSITO>不管他在做什么
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Well, whatever he was doing here,

145
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,410
<6-14,ESPOSITO>我已经让警员在这一带排查
<6-14,ESPOSITO>I've got unis canvassing to see if anyone saw

146
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,600
<6-14,ESPOSITO>询问昨晚是否有人在这一带看到了他
<6-14,ESPOSITO>him or anyone else last night in the area.

147
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,900
<6-15,RYAN>这是什么意思
<6-15,RYAN>I wonder what this means.

148
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,290
<6-15,RYAN>九位数
<6-15,RYAN>Nine digits.

149
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,630
<6-16,CASTLE>鉴于他被人推下楼  摔在一个钩子上
<6-16,CASTLE>Well, given he was pushed off a roof and landed on a hook,

150
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,890
<6-16,CASTLE>那应该不是个幸运数字了
<6-16,CASTLE>I'm saying that is not his lucky number.

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,180
<6-17,RYAN>苏利
<6-17,RYAN>Yo, Sully.

152
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,250
<6-18,SULLY>来了
<6-18,SULLY>Yeah?

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,130
<6-19,RYAN>查下这串数字跟被害人有什么联系
<6-19,RYAN>Check out this number and see how it connects with our victim,

154
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,930
<6-19,RYAN>然后追查一下他死之前都去过哪里
<6-19,RYAN>and let's start piecing together where he was before he wound up here.

155
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,130
<6-20,SULLY>这就去  我查了他的语音留言
<6-20,SULLY>I'm on it. In the meantime, I checked his voicemail,

156
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,830
<6-20,SULLY>他昨天收到一堆愤怒的留言
<6-20,SULLY>and he had a bunch of angry messages yesterday

157
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,010
<6-20,SULLY>是一个女人留的
<6-20,SULLY>from some chick.

158
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,910
<6-20,SULLY>说如果他不打回来  她就杀了他
<6-20,SULLY>Said she would kill him if he didn't call her back.

159
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,830
<6-20,SULLY>她忍受不了被忽视
<6-20,SULLY>Said she would not be ignored.

160
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,860
<6-21,CASTLE>典型的疯狂前女友
<6-21,CASTLE>Aha. A classic rabbit boiler.

161
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,840
<6-21,CASTLE>跟踪狂  先生们  狂热粉丝
<6-21,CASTLE>Stalker, gentlemen. An obsessed fan.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,290
<6-22,ESPOSITO>查清楚她是谁了吗
<6-22,ESPOSITO>Do we know who the caller is?

163
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,710
<6-23,SULLY>我追踪了号码  显示出市中心的一个地址
<6-23,SULLY>Uh, I traced the number to an address downtown.

164
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,900
<6-24,CASTLE>-名字叫  -杰拉尔丁·鲍奥斯
<6-24,CASTLE>- Uh, name is, uh... - Geraldine Powers.

165
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,820
<6-25,SULLY>杰拉尔丁·鲍奥斯  是的
<6-25,SULLY>Ger-geraldine powers. Yeah.

166
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,660
<6-26,CASTLE>我打赌她甚至还把他供了起来
<6-26,CASTLE>I bet she even has a creepy shrine to him.

167
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,010
<7-1,GERALDINE POWERS>查理·雷诺兹不是我杀的
<7-1,GERALDINE POWERS>I did not kill Charlie Reynolds!

168
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,020
<7-2,ESPOSITO>-但你曾威胁要杀了他  -不止一次
<7-2,ESPOSITO>- But you did threaten to kill him. - Repeatedly.

169
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,000
<7-4,CASTLE>你看起来也对他颇为迷恋
<7-4,CASTLE>And you do seem to have more than a casual interest in him.

170
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,740
<7-5,GERALDINE>当然
<7-5,GERALDINE>Well, of course I do.

171
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,390
<7-5,GERALDINE>是我让他的节目长盛不衰
<7-5,GERALDINE>I'm the one who kept his show on the air

172
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,040
<7-5,GERALDINE>整整六季
<7-5,GERALDINE>for six seasons.

173
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,980
<7-6,ESPOSITO>你在接受治疗吗
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Are you taking any medication?

174
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,210
<7-7,GERALDINE>我没疯
<7-7,GERALDINE>I am not delusional.

175
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,880
<7-7,GERALDINE>我是查理的经纪人  傻瓜
<7-7,GERALDINE>I am Charlie's agent, nitwit.

176
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,580
<7-8,RYAN>他的经纪人
<7-8,RYAN>His agent?

177
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,240
<7-8,RYAN>是啊
<7-8,RYAN>Yeah.

178
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,650
<7-9,GERALDINE>得知噩耗后我一直在看这节目
<7-9,GERALDINE>I've been running the shows nonstop since I got the news.

179
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,330
<7-9,GERALDINE>1992年查理出演《跩哥不上学》时
<7-9,GERALDINE>I signed Charlie back in '92

180
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,180
<7-9,GERALDINE>我签下了他
<7-9,GERALDINE>when he was on "2 Cool For School."

181
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,380
<7-10,CHARLIE>我怎么办
<7-10,CHARLIE>What do I do?

182
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,650
<7-11,RAMON RUSSO>放松  小妞喜欢神秘感
<7-11,RAMON RUSSO>Play it cool. Chicks dig mystery.

183
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,240
<7-13,RAMON>-神秘  -她来了
<7-13,RAMON>- Mystery... - Oh, here she comes.

184
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,470
<7-14,GERALDINE>节目被砍后  电话不再响个不停
<7-14,GERALDINE>After the show was canceled, the phones stopped ringing.

185
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,470
<7-14,GERALDINE>大多数经纪人会抛弃他  而我呢
<7-14,GERALDINE>Most agents would have dumped his ass, but me?

186
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,220
<7-14,GERALDINE>我不离不弃
<7-14,GERALDINE>I stuck with him.

187
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,620
<7-14,GERALDINE>就是这里  这是创造历史的一幕
<7-14,GERALDINE>Oh, this is the scene! This is where history was made.

188
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,750
<7-15,CHARLIE>嗨  丽莎
<7-15,CHARLIE>Hey, Lisa...

189
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,660
<7-16,CHARLIE>哈巴  哈巴
<7-16,CHARLIE>Hubba, hubba!

190
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,820
<7-17,CASTLE>永恒的经典  不是吧你
<7-17,CASTLE>A timeless gem? Really?

191
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,020
<7-18,RYAN>那是很精准的表演
<7-18,RYAN>Eh... that was a very... nuanced performance.

192
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,440
<7-19,ESPOSITO>你说的都不足以解释
<7-19,ESPOSITO>Nothing you're telling me is explaining

193
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,450
<7-19,ESPOSITO>你为何要威胁查理·雷诺兹
<7-19,ESPOSITO>why you threatened Charlie Reynolds.

194
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,310
<7-20,GERALDINE>查理的公寓重新装修期间
<7-20,GERALDINE>Charlie moved into a sublet

195
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,310
<7-20,GERALDINE>他搬进了一间转租的房子
<7-20,GERALDINE>while his building was being rehabbed.

196
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,610
<7-20,GERALDINE>几天前  他的几封信
<7-20,GERALDINE>And a few days ago, some of his mail

197
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,830
<7-20,GERALDINE>被错误地寄到了这里
<7-20,GERALDINE>got forwarded here by mistake.

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,770
<7-20,GERALDINE>他的银行账户显示他刚存了
<7-20,GERALDINE>His bank statement showed that he had just made a deposit

199
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,040
<7-20,GERALDINE>125000元
<7-20,GERALDINE>for 125 grand.

200
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,110
<7-20,GERALDINE>我为查理提供的工作
<7-20,GERALDINE>Charlie could barely cover his rent

201
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,480
<7-20,GERALDINE>仅供他支付房租
<7-20,GERALDINE>with the jobs I booked.

202
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,260
<7-20,GERALDINE>那么  这现金是从哪来的
<7-20,GERALDINE>So... where'd he get the cash?

203
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,270
<7-20,GERALDINE>唯一合理的解释是他背着我
<7-20,GERALDINE>Only thing that makes sense is that he booked a gig

204
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,380
<7-20,GERALDINE>接了别的活  把我的佣金占为己有
<7-20,GERALDINE>on the side and cut me out of my commission.

205
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,170
<7-21,RYAN>你知道是什么活吗
<7-21,RYAN>Do you have any idea what that gig was?

206
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,510
<7-22,GERALDINE>不  但他能存这么多钱
<7-22,GERALDINE>No, but... for him to pull in that kind of money...

207
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,530
<7-22,GERALDINE>这活一定不错
<7-22,GERALDINE>it had to be something big.

208
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,320
<8-1,CASTLE>问题是这个神秘的工作
<8-1,CASTLE>The key here is that mystery gig.

209
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,700
<8-1,CASTLE>一个过气  勉强度日的演员
<8-1,CASTLE>A down-on-his-luck actor barely scraping by?

210
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
<8-1,CASTLE>也许他卷入了什么阴谋
<8-1,CASTLE>Maybe he got involved in some shady deal

211
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,530
<8-1,CASTLE>不幸丧命
<8-1,CASTLE>that cost him his life.

212
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,960
<8-2,RYAN>或是有人赏识他的演技
<8-2,RYAN>Or someone recognized his true acting talent

213
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,760
<8-2,RYAN>给了他一份工作
<8-2,RYAN>and gave him a job.

214
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,040
<8-3,ESPOSITO>那个充斥三流明星的《他们在哪儿》真人秀
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Like some c-list "Where Are They Now?" reality show

215
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,020
<8-3,ESPOSITO>他必须和丹尼·布纳德斯还有韦布斯特打架
<8-3,ESPOSITO>where he has to mud-wrestle Danny Bonaduce and Webster

217
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,730
<8-3,ESPOSITO>才能和唐纳德·特朗普一起工作
<8-3,ESPOSITO>just to get a job with Donald Trump.

219
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,960
<8-4,CASTLE>贝克特的桌子这是怎么了
<8-4,CASTLE>What happened to Beckett's desk?

220
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,730
<8-5,ESPOSITO>现在是苏利的桌子了
<8-5,ESPOSITO>That's Sully's desk now.

221
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,090
<8-6,SULLY>卡塞尔先生
<8-6,SULLY>Oh, uh, Mr. Castle,

222
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,740
<8-6,SULLY>抱歉在现场时我有些冒犯
<8-6,SULLY>sorry if I came on a little strong back at the scene.

223
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,600
<8-6,SULLY>我还在努力融入这里
<8-6,SULLY>I'm still trying to get the lay of the land here.

224
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,610
<8-6,SULLY>接贝克特探长的班可不容易
<8-6,SULLY>Detective Beckett left some big shoes to fill.

225
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,770
<8-7,CASTLE>确实  不过你倒是成功地把她的桌子堆满了
<8-7,CASTLE>Yeah, she did. I see you filled her desk.

226
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,360
<8-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>卡塞尔先生  你在这里做什么
<8-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Castle, what are you doing here?

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,240
<8-9,CASTLE>盖茨警监  我
<8-9,CASTLE>Captain Gates, I'm--I-I--

228
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,310
<8-9,CASTLE>我以为你去开会了
<8-9,CASTLE>I-I thought you were at a conference.

229
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,800
<8-10,GATES>提前一天结束了
<8-10,GATES>It ended a day early.

230
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,150
<8-10,GATES>你肯定是查看了我的行程
<8-10,GATES>But you wouldn't even know that

231
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,020
<8-10,GATES>不然你是不会知道的
<8-10,GATES>unless you were checking up on me.

232
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,790
<9-2,GATES>我明白这是怎么回事了
<9-2,GATES>Oh. I see what's happened here.

233
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,080
<8-10,GATES>他厚着脸皮回来
<8-10,GATES>This man has insinuated himself

234
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,000
<8-10,GATES>就是为了调查查理·雷诺兹的案子  是吧
<8-10,GATES>into the Charlie Reynolds investigation, hasn't he?

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
<8-10,GATES>你们还同意了
<8-10,GATES>And you let him.

236
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,620
<8-10,GATES>告诉你  卡塞尔先生
<8-10,GATES>Well, news for you, Mr. Castle.

237
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,700
<8-10,GATES>你不属于纽约警察局
<8-10,GATES>You are not N.Y.P.D.

238
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,000
<8-10,GATES>没有理由再留下来
<8-10,GATES>And you no longer have a reason for being here.

239
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,620
<8-13,MCCORD>这是我们负责的谋杀案
<8-13,MCCORD>This is our murder case.

240
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,770
<8-11,RACHEL MCCORD>不再是了
<8-11,RACHEL MCCORD>Not anymore.

241
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,950
<8-13,MCCORD>-贝克特  -现在归我们负责了
<8-13,MCCORD>- Beckett. - This is our case now.

251
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,610
<9-1,MCCORD>这有一封司法部长的信
<9-1,MCCORD>I have a letter from the attorney general

252
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,780
<9-1,MCCORD>授权我们接管这个案件
<9-1,MCCORD>authorizing our taking point on this case.

253
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,280
<9-2,GATES>我能看一下吗
<9-2,GATES>May I see that, please?

254
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,620
<9-3,BECKETT>你来这里做什么
<9-3,BECKETT>Wh-- what are you doing here?

<9-4,CASTLE>Me? What am I doing--what are you doing here?

256
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,510
<9-4,CASTLE>你怎么不告诉我你回纽约了
<9-4,CASTLE>Why didn't you tell me you were coming to town?

257
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,590
<9-5,BECKETT>本想给你个惊喜的
<9-5,BECKETT>I was gonna surprise you.

258
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,910
<9-6,CASTLE>真好
<9-6,CASTLE>Well done.

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,920
<9-7,GATES>那么就请你给我们简单介绍下情况吧
<9-7,GATES>Then perhaps you should brief the team.

260
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,120
<9-8,MCCORD>早上好  我是麦考德探员
<9-8,MCCORD>Good morning. I am agent McCord.

261
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,260
<9-8,MCCORD>你认识贝克特探员
<9-8,MCCORD>Of course you know Agent Beckett.

262
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,950
<9-8,MCCORD>我们要参与调查
<9-8,MCCORD>We are joining this investigation,

263
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,650
<9-8,MCCORD>需要知道与查理·雷诺兹死亡
<9-8,MCCORD>so we need access to all information

264
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,340
<9-8,MCCORD>相关的一切信息
<9-8,MCCORD>regarding Charlie Reynolds' death.

265
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,530
<9-9,ESPOSITO>按照调查局的说法  这是你们挤兑我们
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Which is Feds speak for you're pushing us out.

266
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,950
<9-10,BECKETT>不  你们继续调查
<9-10,BECKETT>No, you'll continue to work the case.

267
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,480
<9-10,BECKETT>只不过要向我们汇报
<9-10,BECKETT>You'll just be reporting to us.

268
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
<9-11,RYAN>为什么一个前情景喜剧演员的谋杀案
<9-11,RYAN>Uh, why is the murder of an ex-sitcom star

269
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,850
<9-11,RYAN>会成为联邦案件
<9-11,RYAN>a federal case?

270
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,540
<9-12,BECKETT>我们不便透露
<9-12,BECKETT>We're not at liberty to say.

271
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,470
<9-13,GATES>等等  让我把话说明白
<9-13,GATES>No--wait, let me get this straight.

272
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,410
<9-13,GATES>你想让我们继续调查
<9-13,GATES>You want us to continue investigating,

273
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420

<9-13,GATES>report everything to you,

274
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,780

<9-13,GATES>but you're not going to tell us why you're here?

275
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,950
<9-13,GATES>需者方知
<9-13,GATES>It's need-to-know.

276
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,880
<9-14,MCCORD>我们要借用一下会议室
<9-14,MCCORD>We'll be setting up in the conference room.

277
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,520
<9-14,MCCORD>我们需要所有的初步报告
<9-14,MCCORD>We'll need any preliminary reports

278
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,230
<9-14,MCCORD>以及雷诺兹的个人电子产品
<9-14,MCCORD>and all of Reynolds' personal electronics--

279
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,660
<9-14,MCCORD>手机  平板电脑和电脑
<9-14,MCCORD>phones, iPads, computers.

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,180
<9-14,MCCORD>感谢你们的合作
<9-14,MCCORD>Thank you for your cooperation.

281
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,370
<10-1,MCCORD>我们要用死者的手机和电脑数据
<10-1,MCCORD>We'll use the victim's phone and computer data

282
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,300
<10-1,MCCORD>重建他死前二十四小时
<10-1,MCCORD>to reconstruct what he was up to

283
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,990
<10-1,MCCORD>都做了什么
<10-1,MCCORD>in his last 24 hours.

284
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,410
<10-1,MCCORD>特区说得很清楚
<10-1,MCCORD>And by the way, D.C. made it clear

285
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,870
<10-1,MCCORD>调查结果要发给他们
<10-1,MCCORD>that they want us to send it to them.

286
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,100
<10-2,BECKETT>他们要这些数据做什么
<10-2,BECKETT>Why do they want the data?

287
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,740
<10-3,MCCORD>没说  一贯如此
<10-3,MCCORD>They didn't say. They rarely do.

288
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,980
<10-4,BECKETT>这一定让你很困扰吧
<10-4,BECKETT>That's got to bother you.

289
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,570
<10-5,MCCORD>我们不可能知道所有事
<10-5,MCCORD>We don't always get the whole picture.

290
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
<10-5,MCCORD>在特区工作就这样
<10-5,MCCORD>Comes with the territory.

291
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,370
<11-1,CASTLE>我们是不是该过去
<11-1,CASTLE>Maybe we should go over there and just

292
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,500
<11-1,CASTLE>请她们喝杯咖啡
<11-1,CASTLE>invite 'em in for some coffee, you know?

293
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,640
<11-2,ESPOSITO>才不要
<11-2,ESPOSITO>We are not serving them coffee.

294
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,260
<11-2,ESPOSITO>这咖啡机是你买给纽约警察局的
<11-2,ESPOSITO>You bought this espresso machine for the N.Y.P.D.

295
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,150
<11-2,ESPOSITO>-只能给纽约警局的人喝  -拜托  伙计们
<11-2,ESPOSITO>- This is N.Y.P.D. coffee only. - Come on, guys.

296
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,430
<11-3,CASTLE>-这有点过分了  -过分
<11-3,CASTLE>- That's a little harsh. - Harsh?

297
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,780
<11-4,RYAN>贝克特是犹大
<11-4,RYAN>Beckett's a judas.

298
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,870
<11-4,RYAN>她和她搭档抢了我们的案子
<11-4,RYAN>Her and her partner just hijacked our case.

299
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,790
<11-4,RYAN>你是哪边的
<11-4,RYAN>Whose side are you on?

300
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,190
<11-5,CASTLE>这边  当然是你们这边的
<11-5,CASTLE>Your side. Guys, I'm... I'm on your side.

301
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,870
<11-6,ESPOSITO>莱恩  是不是有点奇怪
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Hey, Ryan, isn't it a little weird

302
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,140
<11-6,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔出现的同一天
<11-6,ESPOSITO>that Castle shows up the same day

303
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,310
<11-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特探员就来了
<11-6,ESPOSITO>that Agent Beckett takes over?

304
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,850
<11-7,RYAN>是啊  真巧合
<11-7,RYAN>Yes. It's quite a coincidence.

305
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,890
<11-7,RYAN>不  不是巧合
<11-7,RYAN>No. It's not. It's not a coincide--that--

306
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,470
<11-8,CASTLE>是  不  还真是个巧合
<11-8,CASTLE>Yeah, well... no, actually, yes, it's a coincidence.

307
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,630
<11-9,ESPOSITO>没准你和贝克特是一伙的
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe you and Beckett are in on this together.

308
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,650
<11-9,ESPOSITO>-没准  -什么
<11-9,ESPOSITO>- Maybe... - What?

309
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,280
<11-9,ESPOSITO>你是她的内应
<11-9,ESPOSITO>You are her inside man.

310
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,030
<11-9,ESPOSITO>你是犹大的犹大
<11-9,ESPOSITO>You... are judas' judas.

311
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,200
<11-9,ESPOSITO>不  伙计们  我发
<11-9,ESPOSITO>No--guys--no, I swe--

312
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,670
<11-10,CASTLE>我发誓  咱们认识这么久了
<11-10,CASTLE>I swear. Come on. You know me.

313
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,490
<11-11,ESPOSITO>我会盯着你的 卡塞尔
<11-11,ESPOSITO>I'm watching you, Castle.

314
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,500
<11-12,RYAN>帕穆特说有发现了
<11-12,RYAN>Perlmutter's got something for us.

315
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,190
<11-13,ESPOSITO>-我们走  -好
<11-13,ESPOSITO>- Let's go. - Yeah.

316
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,710
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>经过仔细检查  我把死亡时间区
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>After a complete examination, I was able to narrow

317
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,590
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>缩为11:30到1:30之间
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>time of death to between 11:30 and 1:30.

318
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,010
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>手臂和肩膀上的死前淤青
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>And... perimortem bruising on the arm and shoulder

319
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,110
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>表明有搏斗的迹象
<12-1,PERLMUTTER>is consistent with signs of a struggle.

320
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,140
<12-2,RYAN>查理被推下去之前有过抵抗
<12-2,RYAN>So Charlie fought back before he was thrown off the roof?

321
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,640
<12-3,PERLMUTTER>对  但是
<12-3,PERLMUTTER>Yes. But...

322
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,290
<12-3,PERLMUTTER>最有趣的发现在这里
<12-3,PERLMUTTER>the most fascinating discovery resides in here.

323
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,220
<12-4,CASTLE>这是
<12-4,CASTLE>Which is?

324
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,880
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>我从被害人的鞋底取出来的
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>An unusually large quantity

325
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,670
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>新鲜鸟粪
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>of fresh bird excrement that I extracted

326
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,320
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>粪量异常的大
<12-5,PERLMUTTER>from the tread of the victim's shoes.

327
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,400
<12-6,CASTLE>不用了  我相信你
<12-6,CASTLE>Uh, no... I'll take your word for it.

328
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,660
<12-7,ESPOSITO>他进过鸽子...
<12-7,ESPOSITO>Okay, so he stepped in some pigeon--

329
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,150
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>对  只不过这不是鸽子粪
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>Sure. Only it didn't come from pigeons.

330
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,000
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>仔细分析之后发现
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>A painstaking analysis proves

331
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,790
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>这其实是鸡屎
<12-8,PERLMUTTER>that this is none other than chicken poop.

332
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,710
<12-9,RYAN>在曼哈顿很不常见
<12-9,RYAN>Not a lot of that in Manhattan.

333
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,490
<12-10,CASTLE>也许查理的秘密工作和鸡有关
<12-10,CASTLE>Maybe Charlie's mystery job had something to do with chickens?

334
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,600
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>《跩哥不上学》那种烂剧之后
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>Well, after "2 Cool For School,"

335
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,950
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>干什么都是一种进步啊
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>almost anything is a step up.

336
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,310
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>-喂  -还有什么发现
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>- Now-- - What else you got for us?

337
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,050
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>目前  我只有权利说这么多
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>I'm afraid that's all I'm authorized to tell you at this time.

338
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,250
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>我简直不敢相信
<12-11,PERLMUTTER>I can't believe it.

339
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,320
<13-1,ESPOSITO>连帕穆特都得听联调局的
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Even Perlmutter's answering to the Feds now.

340
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,820
<13-2,RYAN>我们在自己的案子上被架空了
<13-2,RYAN>We're being iced out of our own case.

341
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,850
<13-3,CASTLE>也许她们保密
<13-3,CASTLE>Guys, maybe there's a perfectly reasonable explanation

342
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,170
<13-3,CASTLE>是有合理的原因的
<13-3,CASTLE>for all this secrecy.

343
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,450
<13-3,CASTLE>你们说的对
<13-3,CASTLE>That's-- you... guys are right.

344
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,370
<13-3,CASTLE>这真令人发指
<13-3,CASTLE>This is outrageous!

345
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,710
<13-4,RYAN>苏利  查理的秘密工作有线索了吗
<13-4,RYAN>Hey, yo, Sully, any leads on Charlie's mystery job?

346
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,930
<13-5,SULLY>没有可以解释那125000美金的
<13-5,SULLY>Nothing that explains that 125 grand.

347
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,310
<13-5,SULLY>我目前查到的唯一线索是
<13-5,SULLY>The only thing I've been able to dig up so far

348
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,930
<13-5,SULLY>在过去几年间
<13-5,SULLY>is some personal appearance trips to Russia

349
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,820
<13-5,SULLY>他去过几次俄国
<13-5,SULLY>over the last few years.

350
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,710
<13-6,ESPOSITO>俄国
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Russia?

351
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,930
<13-7,RYAN>《跩哥不上学》在那边很火
<13-7,RYAN>Oh, yeah. "2 Cool For School" is huge over there.

352
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,890
<13-7,RYAN>杜威在俄国就像大卫·哈塞尔霍夫在德国
<13-7,RYAN>Dewey is to Russia what David Hasselhoff is to Germany.

354
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,880
<13-8,SULLY>我还在他信用卡上有所发现
<13-8,SULLY>Oh, I-I did catch a break off his credit card.

355
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,190
<13-8,SULLY>他出事那天
<13-8,SULLY>I got a line on a cab

356
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,780
<13-8,SULLY>有辆出租车去接过他
<13-8,SULLY>that picked Charlie up the day he got killed.

357
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,870
<13-9,CASTLE>送他去哪里
<13-9,CASTLE>Where'd it take him?

358
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,960
<13-10,SULLY>他的转租房  关键在于
<13-10,SULLY>His sublet. But here's the kicker.

359
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,260
<13-10,SULLY>另外一个人也上了车
<13-10,SULLY>Another dude hopped in the backseat,

360
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,690
<13-10,SULLY>他俩打了起来
<13-10,SULLY>and the two of them got in a huge fight.

361
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,940
<13-11,RYAN>有相貌描述吗
<13-11,RYAN>Did you get a description?

362
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,630
<13-12,SULLY>没有  有更好的  知道名字
<13-12,SULLY>Uh, no. Better. I got a name.

363
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,810
<13-12,SULLY>是他以前的合作演员  雷蒙·罗素
<13-12,SULLY>His former co-star Ramon Russo.

364
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,490
<13-13,ESPOSITO>对  他演体优生马克
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah. He played the Jock Marco, right?

365
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,440
<13-15,RYAN>原来你也看过
<13-15,RYAN>So... you have seen the show.

366
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,190
<13-16,ESPOSITO>就是偶尔看过一眼
<13-16,ESPOSITO>Just caught it by accident once. It was...

367
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,330
<13-17,RYAN>那也许你知道
<13-17,RYAN>Oh. Well, then as you might know,

368
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,770
<13-17,RYAN>不仅雷蒙演过马克  还有传言说
<13-17,RYAN>not only did Ramon play Marco, but word is,

369
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,840
<13-17,RYAN>他们憎恨对方
<13-17,RYAN>they hated each other.

370
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,660
<13-18,CASTLE>也许就是不和才导致了谋杀
<13-18,CASTLE>Maybe that feud led to murder.

371
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,790
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>那是个意外
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>It was an accident.

372
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,530
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>我本来想走的  但是他先推了我
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>I tried to walk away, but he pushed me first.

373
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,940
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>我不想杀他的  我发誓
<14-1,RAMON RUSSO>I didn't mean to kill him, I swear.

374
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,130
<14-2,RYAN>雷蒙·罗素
<14-2,RYAN>Ramon Russo?

<14-3,RAMON>I'm telling you, this happens to me all the time,

377
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,280
<14-3,RAMON>不管是我在外面
<14-3,RAMON>whether I'm out there on the street,

378
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,180
<14-3,RAMON>还是在这里上课
<14-3,RAMON>or here teaching class.

<14-4,ESPOSITO>借用你一些时间如何
<14-4,ESPOSITO>How about some of your time?

382
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,600
<14-5,CASTLE>可能要几十年
<14-5,CASTLE>Maybe even decades of it.

383
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,950
<15-1,RAMON>查理的死  对我个人来说是个悲剧
<15-1,RAMON>I'm telling you, Charlie's death is a personal tragedy for me

384
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,780
<15-1,RAMON>也是演员界的巨大损失
<15-1,RAMON>and a huge loss for the acting community,

<15-5,CASTLE>干什么  和鸡有关吗
<15-5,CASTLE>On what? And did it involve chickens?

391
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,060
<15-6,RAMON>鸡  不是  我们在拍《跩哥不上学》
<15-6,RAMON>Chickens? No! we were doing "2 Cool For School."

392
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,190
<15-7,RYAN>但那部剧已经停播20年了
<15-7,RYAN>But that show's been off the air for 20 years.

393
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,770
<15-8,RAMON>不是  我们在拍重聚电影
<15-8,RAMON>No, man. We're doing a reunion movie.

394
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,080
<15-9,RYAN>真的吗
<15-9,RYAN>You are?

395

<15-11,RYAN>这还是我们第一次听说
<15-11,RYAN>I mean, this is just the first we're hearing of it.

<15-12,RAMON>拍摄是保密的  我们都签了
<15-12,RAMON>It's on the down-low. You know, we all had to sign

397
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,450
<15-12,RAMON>那种保密协议
<15-12,RAMON>those confidentiality agreements.

398
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,970
<15-12,RAMON>实话实说
<15-12,RAMON>But to be honest...

399
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,600
<15-12,RAMON>我本来有很多其他剧
<15-12,RAMON>I had a lot of other projects in the works.

400
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,190
<15-12,RAMON>是查理求我来拍的
<15-12,RAMON>Charlie begged me to do it.

401
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,330
<15-12,RAMON>他说  我们这些兄弟
<15-12,RAMON>He said, you know, it'd be fun

402
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,040
<15-12,RAMON>再聚在一起会很有趣的
<15-12,RAMON>to get the old gang back together, you know?

403
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,110
<15-13,ESPOSITO>即便你们两个不和吗
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Even with all the bad blood between you two?

404
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,510
<15-13,ESPOSITO>你的角色马克
<15-13,ESPOSITO>I mean, wasn't your character-- Marco--

405
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,980
<15-13,ESPOSITO>最开始的设定不是主演吗
<15-13,ESPOSITO>originally supposed to be the star of the show?

406
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,390
<15-13,ESPOSITO>杜威火了  抢了风头
<15-13,ESPOSITO>And then Dewey caught fire, stole the spotlight.

407
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,360
<15-13,ESPOSITO>抢了你的风头
<15-13,ESPOSITO>Stole your spotlight.

408
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,240
<15-14,RAMON>我们那时候还小
<15-14,RAMON>We were kids back then.

409
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,870
<15-14,RAMON>那部剧让我们都受益良多
<15-14,RAMON>I mean, that show did a lot of great things for all of us.

410
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,390
<15-14,RAMON>不管我们有什么矛盾
<15-14,RAMON>Whatever issues we had,

411
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,640
<15-14,RAMON>我们很久之前就冰释前嫌了
<15-14,RAMON>we buried the hatchet a long time ago.

412
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,920
<15-16,CASTLE>你的出租车司机可不是这么说的
<15-16,CASTLE>Not according to your cabbie.

413
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,040
<15-16,CASTLE>他说你们两个打起来了
<15-16,CASTLE>He said the two of you got into a big fight.

414
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,390
<15-17,RAMON>是  我生气了  因为他在浪费我的时间
<15-17,RAMON>Yeah, I lost my temper because he was wasting my time.

415
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,300
<15-17,RAMON>他消极怠工
<15-17,RAMON>He was disrespecting the craft.

416
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,330
<15-17,RAMON>查理记不住台词
<15-17,RAMON>Charlie didn't know any of the lines.

417
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,600
<15-17,RAMON>他以前从不这样
<15-17,RAMON>I mean, I'm telling you, he was never like that.

418
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,210
<15-17,RAMON>他一向
<15-17,RAMON>He was--he was always real good

419
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,990
<15-17,RAMON>很擅长记台词什么的
<15-17,RAMON>with that kind of stuff, you know?

420
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,230
<15-18,CASTLE>你是说查理有心事
<15-18,CASTLE>You're saying there was something going on with Charlie.

421
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,230
<15-18,CASTLE>绝对有
<15-18,CASTLE>Definitely.

<15-19,RAMON>他开始变得很焦虑  很疲倦
<15-19,RAMON>He started showing up anxious and tired.

424
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,740
<15-19,RAMON>我问过他怎么了  他不肯说
<15-19,RAMON>And I asked him what was wrong, but he wouldn't say.

00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,550
<16-8,SULLY>我和片场的工作人员谈过了
<16-8,SULLY>Anyway, I, uh, talked to the office staff at the movie set,

441
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,490
<16-8,SULLY>查理不仅最近表现得很怪
<16-8,SULLY>and not only has Charlie been acting weird lately,

442
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,830
<16-8,SULLY>而且两天前  他哄着会计
<16-8,SULLY>but two days ago, he sweet-talked the accountant

443
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,640
<16-8,SULLY>让他看了账本
<16-8,SULLY>into letting him look over the books.

444
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,610
<16-9,CASTLE>明星为什么在乎剧组预算呢
<16-9,CASTLE>Why would the star care about the budget of the show?

445
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,300
<16-10,SULLY>不知道  不过会计说
<16-10,SULLY>I don't know, but the accountant told me

446
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,530
<16-10,SULLY>查理发现了不合法的地方
<16-10,SULLY>that Charlie said he'd found irregularities.

447
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,490
<16-10,SULLY>听好了  他逼她发誓
<16-10,SULLY>And get this. He made her swear

448
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,440
<16-10,SULLY>不能告诉制片人汉克·哈勃
<16-10,SULLY>not to tell the film's producer Hank Harper

449
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,000
<16-10,SULLY>他四处打听  查探
<16-10,SULLY>that he'd been poking around.

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,710
<16-11,CASTLE>汉克·哈勃  我听过这个人
<16-11,CASTLE>Hank Harper? I've heard of him.

451
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,390
<16-11,CASTLE>有传言说他拿球棍
<16-11,CASTLE>Rumor was he chased a director off set

452
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,980
<16-11,CASTLE>追打过一个导演
<16-11,CASTLE>with a baseball bat.

453
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,980
<16-12,RYAN>看这个  虽然罪名从未成立过
<16-12,RYAN>Check this out. Though he's never been convicted,

454
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,940
<16-12,RYAN>但汉克·哈勃面临着
<16-12,RYAN>Hank Harper has faced numerous charges of

455
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,110
<16-12,RYAN>多起挪用公款的控诉
<16-12,RYAN>embezzling money

456
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,460
<16-12,RYAN>都来自他经手的电影
<16-12,RYAN>from the films that he's worked on.

457
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,830
<16-13,ESPOSITO>如果查理发现汉克
<16-13,ESPOSITO>If Charlie would have found out that Hank

458
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,420
<16-13,ESPOSITO>在挪用电影经费
<16-13,ESPOSITO>was skimming money from the movie...

459
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,410
<16-14,CASTLE>也许汉克解雇了查理[给了他一钩子]
<16-14,CASTLE>Then maybe Hank gave Charlie the hook.

460
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,880
<17-1,ESPOSITO>制作办公室的人说
<17-1,ESPOSITO>According to the production office,

461
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,270
<17-1,ESPOSITO>汉克·哈勃在片场的某个地方
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Hank Harper's somewhere here on this set.

462
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,640
<17-1,ESPOSITO>主角都死了他们怎么还在拍
<17-1,ESPOSITO>What could they even be filming if the star is dead?

463
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,930
<17-2,RYAN>可能是没有杜威的戏份
<17-2,RYAN>Probably the scenes without Dewey.

464
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,150
<17-3,CASTLE>或是解释他为什么没出现的戏份
<17-3,CASTLE>Or scenes that explain why he's not in the whole movie.

465
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,600
<17-4,RYAN>或是他死而复生
<17-4,RYAN>Or he's back from the dead.

466
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,980
<17-5,CASTLE>僵尸末日版  那我可要看一看了
<17-5,CASTLE>The Zombie Apocalypse version. Now that I would watch.

467
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,240
<17-6,RYAN>你看
<17-6,RYAN>No, look, right there.

468
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,010
<17-7,ESPOSITO>还有一个
<17-7,ESPOSITO>There's another one.

469
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,320
<17-8,CASTLE>他们肯定是在重新选角
<17-8,CASTLE>They must be re-casting the part.

470
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,590
<17-9,RYAN>搞什么  杜威·汉考克是独一无二的
<17-9,RYAN>What? There's only one Dewey Hancock.

471
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,070
<17-10,ESPOSITO>是吗  跟他去说
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah? Tell him that.

472
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,280
<17-11,VLAD BARDINOV>开拍
<17-11,VLAD BARDINOV>Action!

473
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,590
<17-12,SVETLANA>杜威  谢谢你腾出周五晚
<17-12,SVETLANA>Dewey, thanks for giving up a friday night

474
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,700
<17-12,SVETLANA>陪我监管舞会
<17-12,SVETLANA>to chaperone the dance with me.

475
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
<17-12,SVETLANA>到时候见
<17-12,SVETLANA>I'll see you there.

476
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,470
<17-13,FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE>哈巴  哈巴
<17-13,FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE>Hubba, hubba.

477
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,350
<17-13,FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE>不不不
<17-13,FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE>No, no, no!

478
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,740
<17-14,VLAD>"哈巴  哈巴"不仅仅是一句口头禅
<17-14,VLAD>"hubba, hubba" is not just a catchphrase,

479
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,180
<17-14,VLAD>它是这个角色的精髓
<17-14,VLAD>It is the essence of your character.

480
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,250
<17-14,VLAD>"哈巴  哈巴"发自内心  而不是用大脑
<17-14,VLAD>"hubba, hubba" comes from here, not here.

481
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,510
<17-14,VLAD>斯维特拉娜  让他找到"哈巴  哈巴"的感觉
<17-14,VLAD>And, Svetlana, make him work for the "hubba, hubba."

482
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,610
<17-14,VLAD>不不
<17-14,VLAD>No! No!

483
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,450
<17-15,HANK HARPER>算了吧  拜托  你已经问过了
<17-15,HANK HARPER>Forget it. Please. Come on. You tried this before.

484
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,970
<17-16,ESPOSITO>-不行  -汉克·哈勃
<17-16,ESPOSITO>- The answer's no. - Hank Harper.

485
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,150
<17-17,HANK>你来晚了  帅哥
<17-17,HANK>It's too late, pretty boy.

486
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,490
<17-17,HANK>肌肉男体育老师的角色已经选定了
<17-17,HANK>We already cast the muscular P.E. teacher.

487
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,230
<17-17,HANK>纽约警局
<17-17,HANK>N.Y.P.D.

488
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,180
<17-18,ESPOSITO>我们是为了查理·雷诺兹的死来的
<17-18,ESPOSITO>We're here about Charlie Reynolds.

489
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,310
<17-19,HANK>我再联系你
<17-19,HANK>I'm gonna have to call you back.

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,380
<18-1,HANK>查理是个好孩子  行家里手
<18-1,HANK>Charlie was a great kid, a real pro.

491
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,720
<18-1,HANK>跟他共事让我回忆起跟帕西诺共事的时光
<18-1,HANK>Working with him reminded me of the pictures I did with Pacino.

492
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,570
<18-2,CASTLE>你跟阿尔·帕西诺共事过
<18-2,CASTLE>You worked with Al Pacino?

494
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,280
<18-3,HANK>巴里·帕西诺  不过毫无关系
<18-3,HANK>Barry Pacino. No relation.

495
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,340
<18-3,HANK>一样有本事  长得还更高
<18-3,HANK>Every bit as talented, and taller.

496
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,690
<18-4,RYAN>既然你对查理的评价这么高
<18-4,RYAN>If you have such a high opinion of Charlie,

497
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,080
<18-4,RYAN>为什么找人替换他
<18-4,RYAN>how come you're already replacing him?

498
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,050
<18-4,RYAN>你们得明白
<18-4,RYAN>Look, you gotta understand,

499
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,480
<18-5,HANK>利益攸关
<18-5,HANK>there's a lot of money at stake here.

500
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,270
<18-5,HANK>演出必须继续
<18-5,HANK>The show must go on.

501
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,050
<18-6,CASTLE>我也经历过
<18-6,CASTLE>Ah! I've been there.

502
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,650
<18-6,CASTLE>我的小说《妮基·希特》几年前拍成电影了
<18-6,CASTLE>My book "Nikki Heat" got made into a movie a few years back.

503
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,110
<18-7,HANK>不是直接发行DVD了吗
<18-7,HANK>Didn't that go straight to DVD?

504
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,790
<18-8,CASTLE>剧本有些问题
<18-8,CASTLE>There were script issues.

505
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,850
<18-8,CASTLE>还有...选角问题和导演问题
<18-8,CASTLE>And... casting issues and directing issues.

506
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,030
<18-9,RYAN>查理跟片场工作人员有冲突吗
<18-9,RYAN>Did Charlie have any problems with anyone on set?

507
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,660
<18-10,HANK>据我所知没有
<18-10,HANK>Not that I'm aware of.

508
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,560
<18-10,HANK>人人都喜欢他  没理由不喜欢啊
<18-10,HANK>Everybody loved him. What's not to love?

509
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
<18-11,ESPOSITO>他最近查看了会计账簿
<18-11,ESPOSITO>He took a look at the accounting books recently.

510
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,720
<18-11,ESPOSITO>知道为什么吗
<18-11,ESPOSITO>Any idea why?

511
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,050
<18-12,HANK>猜不出来  喂喂
<18-12,HANK>Can't imagine. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

512
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,870
<18-13,RYAN>-小心点  -我们知道
<18-13,RYAN>- Easy. - Well, we might.

513
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,760
<18-13,RYAN>也许是查理认为有人中饱私囊
<18-13,RYAN>Maybe Charlie thought somebody was skimming money.

514
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,050
<18-14,CASTLE>我们听说你喜欢做假账
<18-14,CASTLE>Yes, we heard about your penchant for creative bookkeeping.

515
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,090
<18-15,HANK>慢着  你们以为我杀了他
<18-15,HANK>Wait. You think I killed him?

516
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,450
<18-16,ESPOSITO>如果查理发现你故技重施
<18-16,ESPOSITO>Well, if Charlie found out that you were up to your old tricks,

517
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,670
<18-16,ESPOSITO>这就是杀人动机
<18-16,ESPOSITO>it would be motive.

518
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,610
<18-17,HANK>首先  我整晚都在这里改剧本
<18-17,HANK>First of all, I was here all night doing script changes.

519
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,830
<18-17,HANK>再说以前的话我可能稍微揩点油
<18-17,HANK>Plus I may have been caught with my hand in the cookie jar in the past,

520
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,630
<18-17,HANK>但现在我不会那么傻
<18-17,HANK>but I'm not stupid enough

521
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,430
<18-17,HANK>去从俄国佬手里偷钱
<18-17,HANK>to steal from the Russians.

522
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,810
<18-18,CASTLE>俄国佬
<18-18,CASTLE>The Russians?

523
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,050
<18-19,HANK>是啊  是他们投资的
<18-19,HANK>Yeah, they're financing this picture.

524
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,760
<18-19,HANK>他们想把它做成系列电影
<18-19,HANK>They want to make this into a franchise.

525
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,470
<18-19,HANK>这可是我的饭票
<18-19,HANK>This is my meal ticket!

526
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,860
<18-19,HANK>所以如果账簿有哪里不妥的
<18-19,HANK>So if there's anything hinky with the books,

527
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,150
<18-19,HANK>跟我无关
<18-19,HANK>it's not 'cause of me.

528
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
<18-19,HANK>我们不会相信你的一面之辞
<18-19,HANK>Yeah, well, we're not gonna take your word for that.

529
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,820
<18-20,ESPOSITO>我们要看看账簿
<18-20,ESPOSITO>We're gonna need to see those books.

530
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,190
<18-21,HANK>好吧
<18-21,HANK>Oh, oh, yeah.

531
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,290
<18-21,HANK>都给你们
<18-21,HANK>They're all yours.

532
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,450
<18-21,HANK>谢谢
<18-21,HANK>Thanks.

533
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,410
<18-22,RYAN>我们还要一顶帽子
<18-22,RYAN>We're gonna need one of these hats, too.

534
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,000
<19-1,RYAN>我有一点不明白
<19-1,RYAN>You know what I don't get?

535
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,090
<19-2,ESPOSITO>你戴着那顶帽子  不明白的东西多了
<19-2,ESPOSITO>You're wearing that hat. There's a lot you don't get.

536
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,730
<19-3,RYAN>假设汉克真的挪用了公款
<19-3,RYAN>Let's say Hank did embezzle money

537
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:35,980
<19-3,RYAN>然后杀了查理封口
<19-3,RYAN>and killed Charlie to silence him.

538
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,440
<19-3,RYAN>联调局怎么牵扯进来了
<19-3,RYAN>Why are the feds involved?

539
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
<19-4,CASTLE>可能跟俄国佬有关系
<19-4,CASTLE>Maybe it has something to do with the Russians.

540
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,770
<19-5,ESPOSITO>如果我们掌握了联调局的切入点
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Well, if we knew the feds' angle,

541
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,470
<19-5,ESPOSITO>就能占据先机了
<19-5,ESPOSITO>we'd have a leg up on solving this.

542
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,130
<19-6,CASTLE>不好意思  我还没想出
<19-6,CASTLE>Sorry, guys, I have yet to come up with

543
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,670
<19-6,CASTLE>疯狂超赞的想法
<19-6,CASTLE>a crazy genius... theories yet.

544
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,360
<19-8,RYAN>不需要
<19-8,RYAN>You don't need to,

545
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,660
<19-8,RYAN>你可以直接接触消息源头
<19-8,RYAN>not when you can go directly to the source.

546
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,400
<19-9,ESPOSITO>让贝克特告诉我们内幕
<19-9,ESPOSITO>Get Beckett to give us the lowdown.

547
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,790
<19-10,CASTLE>等一下
<19-10,CASTLE>Okay, wait a minute--

548
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,480
<19-11,RYAN>我们得到急需的案件资料
<19-11,RYAN>We get much-needed case information,

549
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,240
<19-11,RYAN>你能解决纠结不清的忠诚问题
<19-11,RYAN>you get to clear up any lingering doubts about your loyalty.

550
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,050
<19-11,RYAN>双赢
<19-11,RYAN>Everybody wins.

551
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,160
<19-12,CASTLE>好吧  伙计们  我不能这么做
<19-12,CASTLE>Okay, guys, no, I can't do that, all right?

552
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,300
<19-12,CASTLE>特区那事之后  我们保证不
<19-12,CASTLE>After D.C., we promised we wouldn't--

553
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,220
<19-13,ESPOSITO>我们帮你争取到参与这个案子  卡塞尔
<19-13,ESPOSITO>We did you a solid getting you on this case, Castle.

554
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,010
<19-13,ESPOSITO>这人情是时候还了
<19-13,ESPOSITO>It's time to pay up.

555
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,250
<19-13,ESPOSITO>伙计们
<19-13,ESPOSITO>Guys...

556
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,660
<19-14,CASTLE>她是我未婚妻
<19-14,CASTLE>This is my fiancee.

557
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,580
<19-14,CASTLE>好吗  如果我频频越界
<19-14,CASTLE>Okay? What does it say about our future

558
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,910
<19-14,CASTLE>会影响我们的未来啊
<19-14,CASTLE>if I keep pushing the boundaries?

559
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,600
<19-15,RYAN>卡塞尔  你们的关系就建立在
<19-15,RYAN>Castle, your whole relationship is built

560
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,580
<19-15,RYAN>你各种越界之上
<19-15,RYAN>on a foundation of your boundary pushing.

561
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,330
<19-16,CASTLE>说得好
<19-16,CASTLE>Good point.

562
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,040
<20-1,BECKETT>收到你的短信了
<20-1,BECKETT>I got your text.

563
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,240
<20-2,CASTLE>我就是想跟你见见面
<20-2,CASTLE>I just wanted to check in with you.

564
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,660
<20-2,CASTLE>换了身份
<20-2,CASTLE>You know, it must be weird for you

565
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,180
<20-2,CASTLE>回到局里办案
<20-2,CASTLE>being back here at the precinct,

566
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,670
<20-3,BECKETT>-很怪吧  -是啊
<20-3,BECKETT>- working a case. - Yeah. Yeah, it is.

567
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,590
<20-4,CASTLE>特别是自从麦考德下达禁言令
<20-4,CASTLE>Yeah. Especially since Mccord's little gag order

568
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,250
<20-4,CASTLE>不让你接近
<20-4,CASTLE>prevents you from accessing

569
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,850
<20-4,CASTLE>最得力的破案工具
<20-4,CASTLE>your most effective investigative tool...

570
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,140
<20-4,CASTLE>我
<20-4,CASTLE>Me.

571
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,760
<20-5,BECKETT>好吧  你是工具[混蛋]
<20-5,BECKETT>Yeah, you are a tool, all right?

572
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,600
<20-6,CASTLE>那么
<20-6,CASTLE>So, uh...

573
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,770
<20-6,CASTLE>趁她现在不在
<20-6,CASTLE>She's not here right now,

574
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,810
<20-6,CASTLE>透点消息给我没什么大碍吧
<20-6,CASTLE>so what's the harm in giving me a little tidbit?

575
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,960
<20-7,BECKETT>你这是在行贿
<20-7,BECKETT>This is a bribe.

576
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
<20-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你用一杯拿铁向我行贿
<20-7,BECKETT>Castle, you're bribing me with a latte?

577
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,590
<20-8,CASTLE>没有  我没有
<20-8,CASTLE>No, I am not.

578
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,050
<20-8,CASTLE>得了  别说笑了
<20-8,CASTLE>Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

579
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,030
<20-9,BECKETT>太下作了  即使是对你来说
<20-9,BECKETT>This is low, even for you.

580
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,340
<20-10,CASTLE>听着  我能解决这个案子
<20-10,CASTLE>Look, I can solve this.

581
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,250
<20-10,CASTLE>只是需要更多信息接着查
<20-10,CASTLE>I just need a little more to go on.

582
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,390
<20-10,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<20-10,CASTLE>Castle...

583
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,380
<20-11,BECKETT>你别跟我来这套
<20-11,BECKETT>You're not gonna Castle me on this one.

584
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,360
<20-11,BECKETT>她过来了
<20-11,BECKETT>Okay, she's coming.

585
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,970
<20-12,CASTLE>如果跟俄国佬有关就点一下头
<20-12,CASTLE>Just nod once if it's about the Russians,

586
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,830
<20-12,CASTLE>如果关于其他事就点两下头
<20-12,CASTLE>twice if it's about something else.

587
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,710
<20-12,CASTLE>两下  是关于其他事
<20-12,CASTLE>Twice. About something else.

588
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,050
<20-12,CASTLE>三下  那是
<20-12,CASTLE>Three times. What's--

589
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,240
<20-13,MCCORD>那是...什么意思
<20-13,MCCORD>What does th-- what does that mean?

590
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
<20-14,BECKETT>什么...为什么...我不明白
<20-14,BECKETT>What--how come-- I don't know what that means.

592
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,590
<20-15,MCCORD>有线索  我们走
<20-15,MCCORD>We got a lead. Let's go.

593
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,980
<20-16,BECKETT>再见啦  卡塞尔
<20-16,BECKETT>See you, Castle.

594
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,840
<20-17,CASTLE>点三下头是什么意思
<20-17,CASTLE>What does th-- what does three nods mean?

595
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,270
<21-1,ESPOSITO>如何
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Well?

596
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,490
<21-2,CASTLE>我试过了  但是...
<21-2,CASTLE>I tried, but...

597
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,220
<21-2,CASTLE>她不肯告诉我案子的事
<21-2,CASTLE>She won't talk to me about the case.

598
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,390
<21-3,ESPOSITO>那她们两个要去哪
<21-3,ESPOSITO>Well, where did the two of them go just now?

599
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,060
<21-4,CASTLE>她也没告诉我
<21-4,CASTLE>Yeah, she wouldn't tell me that, either.

600
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,080
<21-5,CASTLE>我只是
<21-5,CASTLE>Hey, I was just--

601
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,190
<21-6,ESPOSITO>我现在不想理你
<21-6,ESPOSITO>I can't even look at you right now.

602
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,760
<21-7,RYAN>伙计们  我们找到一些
<21-7,RYAN>Hey, guys, I think we found something

603
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,510
<21-7,RYAN>查理所看账簿上的线索
<21-7,RYAN>in these books Charlie was looking into.

604
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,190
<21-8,SULLY>我都看过了
<21-8,SULLY>I went over them, and there's no signs

605
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,670
<21-8,SULLY>没有商业诈骗的迹象
<21-8,SULLY>of any financial shenanigans.

606
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,650
<21-9,RYAN>资产负债表看上去很干净  但是
<21-9,RYAN>The balance sheet seems kosher, but, um,

607
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,720
<21-9,RYAN>看看这个分类账条目
<21-9,RYAN>check out this ledger entry.

608
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,380
<21-10,RYAN>这个数字跟查理口袋里找到的一样
<21-10,RYAN>That is the number we found in Charlie's pocket.

609
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,900
<21-11,CASTLE>这就是查理口中的异常部分
<21-11,CASTLE>This must be that irregularity that Charlie was talking about.

610
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,880
<21-11,CASTLE>但这是什么意思呢
<21-11,CASTLE>But what does it mean?

611
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,530
<21-12,RYAN>这是从俄罗斯运来的
<21-12,RYAN>Well, it corresponds to an invoice number

612
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,640
<21-12,RYAN>电影摄像设备的
<21-12,RYAN>for a shipment of camera equipment for the movie

613
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,870
<21-12,RYAN>发票号码
<21-12,RYAN>sent over from Russia.

614
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,180
<21-13,ESPOSITO>这有什么异常的
<21-13,ESPOSITO>What makes that an irregularity?

615
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,570
<21-14,CASTLE>首先  在这里租摄像机
<21-14,CASTLE>Well, for one thing, it'd be a lot cheaper

616
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,730
<21-14,CASTLE>便宜多了
<21-14,CASTLE>just to rent cameras here.

617
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,650
<21-15,RYAN>不仅如此
<21-15,RYAN>Not only that,

618
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,580
<21-15,RYAN>货物还运到了布鲁克林的一家仓库
<21-15,RYAN>but the shipment was sent to a warehouse in Brooklyn...

619
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,220
<21-16,SULLY>隔壁正好是一家鸡加工厂
<21-16,SULLY>which happens to be right next to a chicken processing plant.

620
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,840
<21-17,CASTLE>这就解释了查理鞋上的粪便了
<21-17,CASTLE>Which explains the poop on Charlie's shoes.

621
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,150
<21-18,ESPOSITO>查理被杀之前去了那间仓库
<21-18,ESPOSITO>Charlie went to that warehouse right before he was killed.

622
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,220
<21-18,ESPOSITO>也许凶手也去了那
<21-18,ESPOSITO>Maybe whoever killed him came from there.

623
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,900
<22-1,ESPOSITO>看起来是个废弃仓库
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Looks deserted.

624
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,650
<22-2,CASTLE>是  但并不代表真的被废弃了
<22-2,CASTLE>Yeah, that doesn't mean that it is.

625
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,990
<22-2,CASTLE>这里可能涌现一大群残忍的哥萨克人
<22-2,CASTLE>This place could be teeming with bloodthirsty cossacks.

627
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,360
<22-2,CASTLE>-你还有枪吗  -没你的份
<22-2,CASTLE>- Do you have an extra gun? - Not for you.

628
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,350
<22-4,CASTLE>至少我们来对地方了
<22-4,CASTLE>At least we know we're in the right place.

629
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,280
<22-4,CASTLE>我肯定踩到了什么东西
<22-4,CASTLE>I definitely stepped in something.

630
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,510
<23-1,RYAN>伙计们  我找到了
<23-1,RYAN>Hey, guys, I found it.

631
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,580
<23-1,RYAN>我找到了货物  一样的发票号
<23-1,RYAN>I found the shipment. Same invoice number.

632
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,220
<23-2,ESPOSITO>只是一些摄像器材
<23-2,ESPOSITO>It is just camera gear.

633
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,440
<23-2,ESPOSITO>等等  这是个假底
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. It's a false bottom.

634
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,310
<23-2,ESPOSITO>好的
<23-2,ESPOSITO>All right.

635
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,480
<23-3,CASTLE>我妈总说电影生意很难做
<23-3,CASTLE>My mother always said that the film business was tough.

636
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,890
<23-4,ESPOSITO>这就是为什么俄罗斯人为这部愚蠢的电影筹资
<23-4,ESPOSITO>That's why the Russians are financing that dumbass movie.

637
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,090
<23-4,ESPOSITO>他们利用拍电影走私非法武器
<23-4,ESPOSITO>They're using the production to smuggle in illegal weapons.

638
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,820
<23-5,CASTLE>就像《逃离德黑兰》  只是换成了枪
<23-5,CASTLE>It's like "Argo," but with guns.

639
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,360
<23-6,MCCORD>放下枪  双手举起来
<23-6,MCCORD>Put the gun down and show me your hands!

640
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,060
<23-6,MCCORD>现在慢慢转身
<23-6,MCCORD>Now turn around slowly.

641
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,420
<23-7,BECKETT>你们在这干什么
<23-7,BECKETT>What the hell are you guys doing here?

642
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,040
<23-8,CASTLE>我们找到了你们在找的枪
<23-8,CASTLE>We're finding the guns you're looking for.

643
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,990
<23-9,MCCORD>什么枪
<23-9,MCCORD>What guns?

644
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,790
<23-10,RYAN>你们不知道枪的事吗
<23-10,RYAN>You didn't know about the guns?

645
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,880
<23-11,MCCORD>我们此行是为了观察和汇报
<23-11,MCCORD>We came here to observe and report.

646
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,650
<23-11,MCCORD>关于这件案子我们没你们知道的多
<23-11,MCCORD>We don't know any more about this case than you do.

647
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,310
<23-12,CASTLE>那你们怎么会到这
<23-12,CASTLE>Well, then how did you guys get here?

648
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,210
<23-13,BECKETT>通过重现被害人的行踪
<23-13,BECKETT>By retracing our victim's movements.

649
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,120
<23-14,MCCORD>他被杀那天来过这
<23-14,MCCORD>He came here the day he died.

650
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,630
<23-15,BECKETT>他肯定是无意间发现这些枪
<23-15,BECKETT>He must have come across these guns.

651
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,290
<23-16,MCCORD>我会联系烟草火器与爆炸物管理局保护这些武器
<23-16,MCCORD>I'll contact the A.T.F., have them secure the weapons.

652
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,720
<23-17,ESPOSITO>别这么快  克拉丽斯
<23-17,ESPOSITO>Not so fast, Clarice.

653
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,120
<23-17,ESPOSITO>这是我们找到的
<23-17,ESPOSITO>We're the ones who found 'em,

654
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,830
<23-17,ESPOSITO>所以纽约警察会把这些归为证据
<23-17,ESPOSITO>So N.Y.P.D.'s gonna be the one booking these into evidence.

655
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,320
<23-18,ETHAN WRIGHT>你们都错了
<23-18,ETHAN WRIGHT>That's where you're both wrong!

656
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,330
<23-19,WRIGHT>这些枪哪也不会去
<23-19,WRIGHT>These guns aren't going anywhere.

657
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,840
<24-1,BECKETT>放下你的武器
<24-1,BECKETT>Put your weapon down now.

658
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,000
<24-2,RYAN>你是那个慢跑者 发现尸体的人
<24-2,RYAN>You're the jogger. The guy who found the body.

659
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,240
<24-3,MCCORD>放下枪  我们是联邦探员
<24-3,MCCORD>Just put the gun down. We're federal agents.

660
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,870
<24-4,WRIGHT>我也是
<24-4,WRIGHT>I'm a federal agent, too.

661
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,570
<24-4,WRIGHT>我叫伊森·怀特  中情局的人
<24-4,WRIGHT>Name's Ethan Wright. I'm C.I.A.

662
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,750
<24-4,WRIGHT>让拉丁壮男打个电话  一切就清楚了
<24-4,WRIGHT>Have Mario Lopez here make the call.

664
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,270
<24-5,MCCORD>就算你说的一切属实
<24-5,MCCORD>Assuming you are who you say you are,

665
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,060
<24-5,MCCORD>中情局为什么牵涉其中呢
<24-5,MCCORD>why would the C.I.A. be involved?

666
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,960
<24-6,WRIGHT>查理·雷诺兹在为我们做事
<24-6,WRIGHT>Charlie Reynolds was working for us.

667
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,650
<24-6,WRIGHT>两年前我雇了他
<24-6,WRIGHT>I recruited him two years ago.

668
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,000
<24-7,RYAN>杜威是个间谍
<24-7,RYAN>Dewey was a spy?

669
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,630
<24-8,WRIGHT>我们利用他渗入安东·伦科夫家族
<24-8,WRIGHT>We used him to infiltrate the family of Anton Renkov.

670
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,770
<24-9,CASTLE>安东·伦科夫  我听说过
<24-9,CASTLE>Anton Renkov? I know that name.

671
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,470
<24-9,CASTLE>在俄罗斯他是臭名远昭的黑帮老大
<24-9,CASTLE>He's the most notorious gangster in all Russia.

672
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,950
<24-10,WRIGHT>他也是《跩哥不上学》的狂热粉丝
<24-10,WRIGHT>He's also a major fan of "2 Cool For School."

673
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,210
<24-11,CASTLE>那就是为什么查理去俄罗斯的原因
<24-11,CASTLE>That's why Charlie was taking all those trips to Russia.

674
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,750
<24-12,WRIGHT>没错  那里的人喜欢他
<24-12,WRIGHT>That's right. They love him there,

675
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,570
<24-12,WRIGHT>所以我找到他  希望利用他
<24-12,WRIGHT>So I approached him about using those trips

676
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,180
<24-12,WRIGHT>收集伦科夫及他的黑帮组织的情报
<24-12,WRIGHT>to gather intel on Renkov and his organization.

677
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
<24-12,WRIGHT>查理毫不犹豫答应了  他是个好人
<24-12,WRIGHT>Charlie didn't hesitate. He was good.

678
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,890
<24-12,WRIGHT>事实上他的演技
<24-12,WRIGHT>Turned out he was a better actor

679
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,950
<24-12,WRIGHT>比大部分人想的要好
<24-12,WRIGHT>than most people gave him credit for.

680
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
<24-13,RYAN>我就是这个意思
<24-13,RYAN>That's what I've been saying.

681
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,880
<24-14,ESPOSITO>这家伙身份核实了
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Yo. This guy checks out.

682
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,940
<24-15,RYAN>谢天谢地  胳膊快麻了
<24-15,RYAN>Thank god. My arm.

683
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,760
<24-16,BECKETT>这么说安东·伦科夫利用这部电影
<24-16,BECKETT>So Anton Renkov was using the movie

684
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,210
<24-16,BECKETT>做为幌子为俄罗斯黑帮
<24-16,BECKETT>as a front to smuggle arms into the U.S.

685
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,400
<24-16,BECKETT>走私武器进美国
<24-16,BECKETT>for the Russian mob.

686
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,890
<24-16,BECKETT>而查理的任务就是找到这些枪
<24-16,BECKETT>And Charlie's job was to find those guns.

687
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,120
<24-17,WRIGHT>差不多是这样
<24-17,WRIGHT>More or less.

688
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,340
<24-17,WRIGHT>几天前他联系了我
<24-17,WRIGHT>He contacted me a couple of days ago.

689
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,260
<24-17,WRIGHT>告诉我他已经找到了货物
<24-17,WRIGHT>He told me that he'd located the shipment.

690
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,120
<24-17,WRIGHT>我们安排了会面  打算给他一个GPS追踪器
<24-17,WRIGHT>We set up a meet so we could get him a G.P.S. tracker

691
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
<24-17,WRIGHT>安防在枪支上
<24-17,WRIGHT>to attach to the guns.

692
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,090
<24-17,WRIGHT>他没打电话给我  我开始找他
<24-17,WRIGHT>When he didn't call, I started looking for him.

693
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,700
<24-18,MCCORD>你可以早点告诉我们的
<24-18,MCCORD>Would have been nice if you told us sooner.

694
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,790
<24-19,WRIGHT>怎么说呢  需者方知
<24-19,WRIGHT>What can I say? It was need-to-know.

695
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,790
<24-20,WRIGHT>我们需要你监控这次调查
<24-20,WRIGHT>We needed you to monitor the investigation

696
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,020
<24-20,WRIGHT>以防纽约警察惊动俄罗斯人
<24-20,WRIGHT>So N.Y.P.D. didn't get too close to the Russians

697
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,650
<24-20,WRIGHT>从而损害我们的行动
<24-20,WRIGHT>to compromise our operation.

698
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,650
<24-20,WRIGHT>我们也想到你们会指引我们找到军火
<24-20,WRIGHT>We also figured you might lead us to the weapons,

699
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,630
<24-20,WRIGHT>你们真的找到了
<24-20,WRIGHT>which you did.

700
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,460
<24-21,CASTLE>那现在怎么办
<24-21,CASTLE>So... what happens now?

701
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,110
<24-22,WRIGHT>我们希望伦科夫拿走这些枪
<24-22,WRIGHT>We hope that Renkov sends the guns on

702
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,450
<24-22,WRIGHT>不论这些枪去往何地
<24-22,WRIGHT>to wherever they're going...

703
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,150
<24-22,WRIGHT>我们就可以追踪它们
<24-22,WRIGHT>So we can track them.

704
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,240
<24-22,WRIGHT>而你们可以走了
<24-22,WRIGHT>And you guys walk away.

705
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
<25-1,RYAN>不敢相信查理被派去
<25-1,RYAN>I can't believe Charlie was spying

706
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,840
<25-1,RYAN>安东·伦科夫和黑帮组织身边做间谍
<25-1,RYAN>on Anton Renkov and his organization.

707
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,880
<25-1,RYAN>-有没有哪个熟面孔  -有
<25-1,RYAN>- Any of them look familiar? - Yeah.

708
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,340
<25-2,ESPOSITO>我看到三个俄罗斯人出现在电影片场
<25-2,ESPOSITO>I saw about three of those Russians on the movie set.

709
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,610
<25-3,SULLY>根据国际刑警那边的资料
<25-3,SULLY>Mm-hmm. And according to interpol,

710
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,870
<25-3,SULLY>他们在本国都有犯罪记录
<25-3,SULLY>all of them got criminal records back in the motherland--

711
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,030
<25-3,SULLY>袭击  谋杀  坏事做尽
<25-3,SULLY>Assault, murder, all kinds of bad stuff.

712
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,950
<25-4,RYAN>我猜他们其中一个发现了查理是个间谍
<25-4,RYAN>I bet one of them found out that Charlie was a spy,

713
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,920
<25-4,RYAN>然后杀了他
<25-4,RYAN>and they killed him.

714
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,370
<25-5,BECKETT>尤其当我们知道
<25-5,BECKETT>Especially since we know that Charlie

715
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,120
<25-5,BECKETT>查理去仓库的时候被跟踪
<25-5,BECKETT>was followed to the warehouse.

716
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,170
<25-6,RYAN>基于什么
<25-6,RYAN>Based on what?

717
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,740
<25-7,BECKETT>我们通过查理的手机信号
<25-7,BECKETT>We tracked Charlie's movements

718
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,240
<25-7,BECKETT>三角定位追踪查理的行踪
<25-7,BECKETT>by triangulating the cell towers that his phone pinged off,

719
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,090
<25-7,BECKETT>之后我们用时间标志
<25-7,BECKETT>and then we used that time stamp

720
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,660
<25-7,BECKETT>拿到了仓库的卫星录像
<25-7,BECKETT>to pull satellite footage of the warehouse.

721
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,050
<25-8,BECKETT>你们怎么找到那的
<25-8,BECKETT>How'd you guys get there?

722
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,370
<25-9,ESPOSITO>鸡粪
<25-9,ESPOSITO>Chicken poop.

723
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,920
<25-10,BECKETT>不管怎么找到的
<25-10,BECKETT>Well, whatever works.

724
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,960
<25-10,BECKETT>我们知道有人跟踪他
<25-10,BECKETT>We knew someone was following him.

725
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,250
<25-10,BECKETT>这就是调查的方向
<25-10,BECKETT>That's what I'd investigate.

726
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,790
<25-11,MCCORD>事实上  我们要暂停调查了
<25-11,MCCORD>Actually, we need to hit pause on the investigation.

727
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,180
<25-11,MCCORD>特区那边下通知了
<25-11,MCCORD>Word just came down from D.C.

728
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,940
<25-12,ESPOSITO>为什么
<25-12,ESPOSITO>Why?

729
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,730
<25-13,MCCORD>中情局不相信伦科夫知道查理是间谍
<25-13,MCCORD>C.I.A. doesn't believe Renkov knows Charlie was a mole.

730
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,110
<25-13,MCCORD>他们认为俄罗斯人会转移那些武器
<25-13,MCCORD>They think the Russians would have moved the weapons

731
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,800
<25-13,MCCORD>如果他们知道的话
<25-13,MCCORD>If they knew.

732
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,620
<25-14,RYAN>我们对那些武器没兴趣
<25-14,RYAN>Well, we're not interested in the weapons.

733
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,750
<25-14,RYAN>我们只是想破谋杀案
<25-14,RYAN>We just want to solve his murder.

734
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,360
<25-15,MCCORD>特区对此也有问题
<25-15,MCCORD>And D.C. Has a problem with that.

735
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,590
<25-15,MCCORD>你们跟俄罗斯人谈话  会打草惊蛇
<25-15,MCCORD>You talk to these Russians, it could kick up some dust,

736
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,630
<25-15,MCCORD>引起他们对查理·雷诺兹的警觉
<25-15,MCCORD>set off their alarms about Charlie Reynolds

737
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,460
<25-15,MCCORD>这会影响中情局的行动
<25-15,MCCORD>and jeopardize the C.I.A. operation.

738
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,220
<25-16,ESPOSITO>那你的暂停调查意思就是停止调查
<25-16,ESPOSITO>Okay. So by "pause," what you really mean is "stop."

739
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,450
<25-17,MCCORD>我知道你的感受
<25-17,MCCORD>I know how you feel,

740
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,650
<25-17,MCCORD>但这个案子牵涉到国家安全
<25-17,MCCORD>but this case intersects with national security issues.

741
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,340
<25-17,MCCORD>我很抱歉  但一切都结束了
<25-17,MCCORD>I'm sorry, but it's over.

742
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,360
<26-1,CASTLE>收到你的短信了  你几点的飞机
<26-1,CASTLE>Got your text. What time's your flight?

743
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,630
<26-2,BECKETT>明天早上
<26-2,BECKETT>Tomorrow morning.

744
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,830
<26-3,CASTLE>听着
<26-3,CASTLE>So listen.

745
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:38,000
<26-3,CASTLE>关于收买你那件事我很抱歉
<26-3,CASTLE>I'm, uh, sorry about that whole bribe thing.

746
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,900
<26-3,CASTLE>我早该清楚你是清廉的
<26-3,CASTLE>I should have known you were incorruptible.

747
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,430
<26-4,BECKETT>我可不这么认为
<26-4,BECKETT>Yeah, I wouldn't say that.

748
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,510
<26-5,CASTLE>那么  允许我试着带坏你
<26-5,CASTLE>Well, then allow me to try and corrupt you

749
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,610
<26-5,CASTLE>待会儿在我家
<26-5,CASTLE>A little later at my place,

750
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,310
<26-5,CASTLE>我们终于可以二人世界
<26-5,CASTLE>Where we can finally have some alone time.

751
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,470
<26-5,CASTLE>我说的二人世界  指的是你和我
<26-5,CASTLE>And by "alone time," I mean you and me and...

752
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,170
<26-5,CASTLE>还有我妈和阿莱克西斯还有...派
<26-5,CASTLE>My mother and Alexis and... Pi.

753
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,070
<26-6,BECKETT>这个
<26-6,BECKETT>That...

754
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,110
<26-6,BECKETT>听起来有点挤
<26-6,BECKETT>That sounds... crowded.

755
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,330
<26-7,CASTLE>是的
<26-7,CASTLE>Yeah.

756
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,680
<26-8,BECKETT>等你们破了这个案子
<26-8,BECKETT>You know what? Why don't you just give me a call

757
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,130
<26-8,BECKETT>给我打个电话
<26-8,BECKETT>after you guys have solved the case?

758
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,560
<26-9,CASTLE>你没听麦考德说的吗  案子结束了
<26-9,CASTLE>Didn't you hear McCord? The case is wrapped.

759
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,900
<26-10,BECKETT>是吗
<26-10,BECKETT>Is it?

760
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,740
<27-1,RYAN>"牺牲小我"什么的最操蛋
<27-1,RYAN>This whole "greater good" thing blows.

761
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,380
<27-1,RYAN>查理是为国牺牲的
<27-1,RYAN>Charlie died serving his country.

762
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,560
<27-1,RYAN>他应该得到公道
<27-1,RYAN>He deserves justice.

763
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,870
<27-2,ESPOSITO>贝克特怎么了  她以前明白这个道理的
<27-2,ESPOSITO>What happened to Beckett? She used to understand that.

764
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,560
<27-3,CASTLE>我认为她依旧明白
<27-3,CASTLE>I think she still does.

765
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,650
<27-3,CASTLE>这个应该就是贝克特所说的
<27-3,CASTLE>This must be the satellite footage

767
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,070
<27-3,CASTLE>卫星摄像
<27-3,CASTLE>Beckett was talking about.

768
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,590
<28-1,RYAN>这里拍到查理走进仓库
<28-1,RYAN>And there's Charlie entering the warehouse.

770
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,960
<28-2,ESPOSITO>先生们
<28-2,ESPOSITO>Uh, gentlemen?

771
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,510
<28-3,GATES>我猜你们是在处理那个已经结束调查的
<28-3,GATES>I take it you're finishing up paperwork on the case

772
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,040
<28-3,GATES>案子的文书工作
<28-3,GATES>that you are no longer investigating?

773
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,630
<28-6,RYAN>-没错  -是的  头  -必须的
<28-6,RYAN>- You bet. - Yes, sir. - Absolutely.

774
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,300
<28-7,GATES>很好  继续吧
<28-7,GATES>Good. Carry on.

775
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,710
<28-8,CASTLE>看到这个人了吗
<28-8,CASTLE>Okay. You see him?

777
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,020
<28-8,CASTLE>贝克特说的没错  查理被人跟踪了
<28-8,CASTLE>Beckett was right. Charlie was followed.

778
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,770
<28-9,ESPOSITO>而且他还带着棒球帽做伪装
<28-9,ESPOSITO>And look, he's wearing a baseball cap to be incognito.

779
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,620
<28-10,RYAN>隐藏得不够深呀  你看帽子上的图案
<28-10,RYAN>Not incognito enough. Check out the design on that hat.

781
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,090
<28-10,RYAN>就跟我拿的那顶
<28-10,RYAN>Just like the...

782
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,680
<28-10,RYAN>《跩哥不上学》的剧组帽子一样
<28-10,RYAN>"2 Cool For School" crew hat that I got.

783
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,670
<28-10,RYAN>那顶被你取笑的帽子
<28-10,RYAN>The one you made fun of.

784
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,600
<28-11,CASTLE>所以跟踪查理的人是剧组里的人
<28-11,CASTLE>So whoever followed Charlie came from the movie set.

785
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,380
<29-1,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Thanks for your time.

786
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,650
<29-1,ESPOSITO>伙计们  剧组上的人都说
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Guys, nobody at the production office

787
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,190
<29-1,ESPOSITO>没看到有人跟踪查理
<29-1,ESPOSITO>saw Charlie being followed.

788
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,010
<29-1,ESPOSITO>但是那天他录影一结束
<29-1,ESPOSITO>But soon as he was done filming for the day,

789
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,600
<29-1,ESPOSITO>就让私人助理开车送他去了布鲁克林的一个杂货铺
<29-1,ESPOSITO>a P.A. gave him a ride to a bodega in Brooklyn.

790
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,110
<29-1,ESPOSITO>那个杂货铺离仓库只有五个街区
<29-1,ESPOSITO>That bodega -- five blocks from the warehouse.

791
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,840
<30-1,RYAN>这是杂货铺外面的摄像头的监控录像
<30-1,RYAN>This is the security cam footage from outside the bodega.

792
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,900
<30-1,RYAN>根据时间
<30-1,RYAN>And based on the time stamp,

793
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
<30-2,ESPOSITO>私人助理正是这个时候把查理送到那
<30-2,ESPOSITO>this is when the P.A. dropped Charlie off.

794
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,080
<30-3,CASTLE>来了  是他
<30-3,CASTLE>That's him. There he is.

795
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,440
<30-3,CASTLE>好的
<30-3,CASTLE>Okay...

796
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,700
<30-4,RYAN>接着
<30-4,RYAN>and...

797
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,620
<30-4,RYAN>之后就是戴帽子那家伙了
<30-4,RYAN>there's our guy in the crew hat.

798
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,210
<30-4,RYAN>看不清他的脸
<30-4,RYAN>I can't quite make out his face.

799
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,260
<30-5,ESPOSITO>换个角度试试
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Try a different angle.

800
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,210
<30-6,RYAN>我拉近画面试试
<30-6,RYAN>Ah, I'm gonna try zooming in.

801
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,490
<30-7,CASTLE>那是电影里的女演员
<30-7,CASTLE>That's the actress from the movie.

802
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,230
<30-8,ESPOSITO>等一下  她不只是个演员
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. She's not just an actress.

803
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,550
<30-8,ESPOSITO>她还是斯维特拉娜·伦科夫
<30-8,ESPOSITO>She's also Svetlana Renkov.

804
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,070
<30-8,ESPOSITO>她是安东的侄女
<30-8,ESPOSITO>She's Anton's niece.

805
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,400
<30-8,ESPOSITO>哈巴  哈巴
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Hubba, hubba.

806
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,250
<31-1,MCCORD>也就是说你们的人做了
<31-1,MCCORD>So basically your people did exactly

807
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,790
<31-1,MCCORD>我明确说明不要做的事
<31-1,MCCORD>what I told them not to do?

808
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,980
<31-2,GATES>当你认为中情局的行动
<31-2,GATES>You put us in a difficult spot when you decided

809
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,060
<31-2,GATES>比破谋杀案更重要的那刻起
<31-2,GATES>that the C.I.A.'s agenda was more important

810
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,030
<31-2,GATES>我们就已经骑虎难下了
<31-2,GATES>than solving a murder?

811
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,870
<31-3,MCCORD>这不是我的决定  我也只是听命而行
<31-3,MCCORD>I didn't decide anything. Orders came down.

812
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,810
<31-4,GATES>这不是我第一次
<31-4,GATES>This is not my first rodeo

813
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,720
<31-4,GATES>对付华府来的人了
<31-4,GATES>dealing with the folks down in D.C.

814
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,460
<31-4,GATES>很快  对于你们来说
<31-4,GATES>Soon enough,

815
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,670
<31-4,GATES>查理·雷诺兹就消失在记忆的长河里了
<31-4,GATES>the name "Charlie Reynolds" will be a distant memory for you.

816
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,810
<31-4,GATES>但是我们则不会
<31-4,GATES>But not for us.

817
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,950
<31-4,GATES>也许他没有伤心欲绝的母亲
<31-4,GATES>He may not have had a grieving mother

818
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,050
<31-4,GATES>或是妻子在家等候
<31-4,GATES>or a wife waiting for him,

819
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,470
<31-4,GATES>但是他的凶手仍应得到惩罚
<31-4,GATES>but his killer should not go unpunished.

820
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,790
<31-5,MCCORD>不管怎么说
<31-5,MCCORD>Regardless,

821
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,610
<31-5,MCCORD>我都不能让你们去审问斯维特拉娜·伦科夫
<31-5,MCCORD>I can't let you take a run at Svetlana Renkov.

822
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,500
<31-6,BECKETT>中情局之所以停了这个案子
<31-6,BECKETT>Look, the whole reason

823
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,670
<31-6,BECKETT>就是因为他们坚信
<31-6,BECKETT>the C.I.A. is shutting this case down

824
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,070
<31-6,BECKETT>俄国佬还不知道
<31-6,BECKETT>is because they are convinced that the Russians

825
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,620
<31-6,BECKETT>查理是个间谍
<31-6,BECKETT>didn't realize that Charlie was a spy.

826
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,610
<31-6,BECKETT>但是安东的侄女在跟踪他
<31-6,BECKETT>But Anton's niece following Charlie

827
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,150
<31-6,BECKETT>这似乎跟他们的结论不符
<31-6,BECKETT>seems to contradict that.

828
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,460
<31-6,BECKETT>而且如果俄国佬真的盯上了查理
<31-6,BECKETT>And if the Russians did get on to Charlie,

829
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,650
<31-6,BECKETT>中情局应该也希望知道
<31-6,BECKETT>wouldn't the C.I.A. want to know

830
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,630
<31-6,BECKETT>他们的行动暴露了吧
<31-6,BECKETT>that their mission is compromised?

831
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,250
<39-6,BECKETT>好吧
<39-6,BECKETT>Okay.

832
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,590
<31-6,BECKETT>为了控制住局面
<31-6,BECKETT>In the spirit of containment...

833
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,010
<31-7,MCCORD>我们去找斯维特拉娜聊聊吧
<31-7,MCCORD>let's talk to Svetlana.

834
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,130
<32-1,MCCORD>你跟踪了他
<32-1,MCCORD>You followed him.

835
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,280
<32-1,MCCORD>你跟踪他到了仓库
<32-1,MCCORD>You followed him to the warehouse.

836
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,840
<32-2,SVETLANA RENKOV>是的
<32-2,SVETLANA RENKOV>Yes.

837
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,160
<32-3,BECKETT>他为什么要去仓库
<32-3,BECKETT>Why did he go there?

838
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,280
<32-4,SVETLANA>他在找枪
<32-4,SVETLANA>He was looking for guns.

839
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,150
<32-5,MCCORD>你也正是在那个时候意识到
<32-5,MCCORD>And that was when you realized...

840
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,720
<32-5,MCCORD>他要背叛你的家人
<32-5,MCCORD>he was about to betray your family,

841
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,420
<32-5,MCCORD>所以你就告密了
<32-5,MCCORD>and so you told them.

842
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,730
<32-6,SVETLANA>我没告诉任何人
<32-6,SVETLANA>I told no one.

843
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,460
<32-7,BECKETT>你甚至没告诉你的叔叔安东
<32-7,BECKETT>You didn't even tell your uncle Anton

844
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,510
<32-7,BECKETT>-或是其他亲戚吗  -没有
<32-7,BECKETT>- or your other relatives? - No.

845
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,400
<32-8,SVETLANA>我知道查理是间谍
<32-8,SVETLANA>I knew Charlie was a spy,

846
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,260
<32-8,SVETLANA>但我从来没跟家人透露过
<32-8,SVETLANA>but I never said so to my family.

847
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,930
<32-8,SVETLANA>我宁愿先死
<32-8,SVETLANA>I would die first.

848
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,010
<32-8,SVETLANA>我和查理相爱了
<32-8,SVETLANA>We were in love.

849
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,760
<32-9,BECKETT>抱歉  你说什么
<32-9,BECKETT>I'm sorry. What?

850
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,210
<32-10,SVETLANA>我可以拿我们的情书给你看
<32-10,SVETLANA>I can show you our love letters.

851
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,930
<33-1,RYAN>你笑话杜威  可他不仅仅是秘密特工
<33-1,RYAN>You mock Dewey, but not only was he a secret agent,

852
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,960
<33-1,RYAN>还抱得美人归
<33-1,RYAN>look at that.

853
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,310
<33-1,RYAN>他风流倜傥
<33-1,RYAN>He was a stud.

854
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,010
<33-2,CASTLE>这简直就是罗密欧与朱丽叶
<33-2,CASTLE>It's Romeo and Juliet...

855
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,350
<33-2,CASTLE>只不过罗密欧是个书呆子
<33-2,CASTLE>with a nerdy Romeo.

856
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,570
<33-3,ESPOSITO>而朱丽叶是个超级火辣的俄国妹
<33-3,ESPOSITO>And a smokin'-hot Russian Juliet.

857
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,310
<33-3,ESPOSITO>我们是一见钟情
<33-3,ESPOSITO>We fell in love the moment we met.

858
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,920
<34-1,SVETLANA>两年来我只有在查理
<34-1,SVETLANA>For two years, I only saw Charlie

859
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,520
<34-1,SVETLANA>来俄国参加安东的派对时才有机会见他
<34-1,SVETLANA>when he came to Anton's parties in Russia.

860
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,010
<34-1,SVETLANA>他知道我想逃离
<34-1,SVETLANA>He knew I wanted to get away --

861
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,830
<34-1,SVETLANA>逃离那种生活
<34-1,SVETLANA>away from that life.

862
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,300
<34-1,SVETLANA>所以当安东投资这部电影时
<34-1,SVETLANA>So when Anton paid for the movie,

863
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,420
<34-1,SVETLANA>查理说这是我来美国
<34-1,SVETLANA>Charlie said it was a-a perfect chance

864
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,690
<34-1,SVETLANA>我们俩团聚的绝佳机会
<34-1,SVETLANA>for me to come here, for us to be together.

865
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,990
<34-2,BECKETT>如果你说的都是事实的话
<34-2,BECKETT>Okay, if all of that's true,

866
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,300
<34-2,BECKETT>那你又为什么要跟踪他到仓库去呢
<34-2,BECKETT>then why did you trail him to the warehouse?

867
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,960
<34-3,SVETLANA>我想求他不要去找那些枪
<34-3,SVETLANA>To beg him not to look for those guns.

868
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,560
<34-3,SVETLANA>我担心我的家人会发现
<34-3,SVETLANA>I was afraid my family would find out.

869
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,200
<34-4,MCCORD>事实上呢
<34-4,MCCORD>And did they?

870
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,800
<34-5,SVETLANA>没发现  不然的话我也死定了
<34-5,SVETLANA>No. If they knew, I would be dead, too.

871
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,660
<34-5,SVETLANA>我叫查理罢手  但他不肯听我的
<34-5,SVETLANA>I told him to stop, but Charlie wouldn't listen to me.

872
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,550
<34-5,SVETLANA>他说在我们消失之前
<34-5,SVETLANA>He said he had to finish this one last mission

873
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,130
<34-5,SVETLANA>他必须完成这个最后的任务
<34-5,SVETLANA>before we disappeared.

874
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,080
<34-6,MCCORD>你说消失是什么意思
<34-6,MCCORD>What do you mean, disappeared?

875
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,820
<34-7,SVETLANA>我们准备私奔然后重新开始
<34-7,SVETLANA>We were going to run away and start over.

876
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,800
<34-7,SVETLANA>我们原定在今天离开的
<34-7,SVETLANA>We were supposed to leave today,

877
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,900
<34-7,SVETLANA>逃离我的家庭  重新开始
<34-7,SVETLANA>get away from my family, get a fresh start.

878
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,840
<34-7,SVETLANA>查理想抛下过去的一切
<34-7,SVETLANA>Charlie wanted to leave everything behind --

879
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,390
<34-7,SVETLANA>间谍工作  演艺工作
<34-7,SVETLANA>the spying, the acting,

880
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,840
<34-7,SVETLANA>和杜威那个愚蠢的角色
<34-7,SVETLANA>the stupid character of Dewey.

881
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,120
<34-8,MCCORD>那他的公寓呢  他可是刚花了一大笔钱
<34-8,MCCORD>What about his apartment? He just spent a lot of money

882
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,420
<34-8,MCCORD>重新装修呢
<34-8,MCCORD>renovating it.

883
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,640
<34-9,SVETLANA>也不要了
<34-9,SVETLANA>He was leaving that, too.

884
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,670
<34-10,BECKETT>他可能忍不住
<34-10,BECKETT>I mean, he could have gone to the roof

885
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,580
<34-10,BECKETT>想要再最后看一眼那个地方  道个别
<34-10,BECKETT>for one last look at the place, say good-bye.

886
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,380
<34-11,SVETLANA>他用不着  他知道公寓会有人照顾的
<34-11,SVETLANA>He didn't have to. He knew it was in good hands.

887
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,990
<34-11,SVETLANA>他把它赠给了一个朋友
<34-11,SVETLANA>He was giving it to a friend.

888
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,010
<34-11,SVETLANA>所以他那晚才会在那
<34-11,SVETLANA>That's why he was there that night.

889
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,240
<34-12,MCCORD>那位朋友是谁
<34-12,MCCORD>Who's the friend?

890
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,340
<35-1,CASTLE>这太难以置信了
<35-1,CASTLE>I can't believe it.

891
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,530
<35-2,RYAN>真没想到是他
<35-2,RYAN>It's not who I would have expected.

892
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,340
<35-3,ESPOSITO>他一直躲在我们眼皮底下
<35-3,ESPOSITO>He was hiding in plain sight this whole time.

893
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,010
<35-3,ESPOSITO>雷蒙
<35-3,ESPOSITO>Ramon.

894
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,720
<35-4,RYAN>你被捕了
<35-4,RYAN>You're under arrest.

895
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,710
<35-4,RYAN>雷蒙你之前跟我们说
<35-4,RYAN>Now, Ramon, you told us

896
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,620
<36-1,ESPOSITO>你除了这部电影外还有别的工作
<36-1,ESPOSITO>that you had other projects in the works,

897
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,610
<36-1,ESPOSITO>你说你接拍完全是为了查理
<36-1,ESPOSITO>that you did the reunion move as a favor to Charlie.

898
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,930
<36-2,RAMON>看在旧情义的份上
<36-2,RAMON>For old times' sake.

899
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,430
<36-2,RAMON>朋友就该这样
<36-2,RAMON>That's what friends are for.

900
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,040
<36-2,RAMON>但我并不是个凶手
<36-2,RAMON>That doesn't make me a killer.

901
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,350
<36-3,ESPOSITO>我们调查了一下
<36-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Well, we looked into these, um,

902
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,640
<36-3,ESPOSITO>你所谓的其它工作  我们发现
<36-3,ESPOSITO>other projects, and, well, this is what we found.

903
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,720
<36-4,RYAN>你在东环球安保公司
<36-4,RYAN>You've been working the graveyard

904
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,000
<36-4,RYAN>当了四年的墓地看守员
<36-4,RYAN>at Global East Security for four years.

905
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
<36-6,RAMON>演艺事业嘛
<36-6,RAMON>Well, you know, acting has its, uh,

906
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,120
<36-6,RAMON>有起有落
<36-6,RAMON>ups and downs, you know?

907
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,070
<36-6,RAMON>我知道我会很快重回演艺圈的
<36-6,RAMON>I knew I'd get back in the game soon enough.

908
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,640
<36-7,ESPOSITO>是啊  特别是当在《跩哥不上学》里
<36-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Especially if playing the football coach

909
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,820
<36-7,ESPOSITO>扮演足球教练
<36-7,ESPOSITO>on "2 Cool For School"

910
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,220
<36-7,ESPOSITO>成了稳定的工作
<36-7,ESPOSITO>turned out to be a recurring gig.

911
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,120
<36-8,RYAN>本来是想拍续集的  但如果查理退出
<36-8,RYAN>Plan was to make sequels, but if Charlie bailed,

912
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,630
<36-8,RYAN>就拍不成了
<36-8,RYAN>there wouldn't be any.

913
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,580
<36-10,RYAN>你就又得回去当保安了
<36-10,RYAN>You'd be back to working security.

914
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,280
<36-11,RAMON>我没有伤害查理  我有不在场证明
<36-11,RAMON>I didn't hurt Charlie. I have an alibi.

915
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,660
<36-11,RAMON>现在没有了
<36-11,RAMON>Well, yeah... not anymore.

<36-12,ESPOSITO>See, your girlfriend admitted to us

917

<36-12,ESPOSITO>她为你说了谎
<36-12,ESPOSITO>that she lied for you.

918
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,790
<36-13,RYAN>她同时承认
<36-13,RYAN>She also mentioned that

919
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,290
<36-13,RYAN>那晚你借了他的信用卡
<36-13,RYAN>you borrowed her credit card that night.

920
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,460

<36-14,ESPOSITO>去查理的住处
<36-14,ESPOSITO>To Charlie's building.

922
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,590
<36-15,RYAN>你从未告诉我们查理打算让你
<36-15,RYAN>You never told us that Charlie was gonna let you

923
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,400
<36-15,RYAN>住他的公寓  因为你知道
<36-15,RYAN>stay at his apartment, because you knew

924
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,470
<36-15,RYAN>那会将你与犯罪现场联系起来
<36-15,RYAN>it connected you to the crime scene.

925
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,040
<36-16,RAMON>我可以解释清楚一下  好吗
<36-16,RAMON>I can explain, okay? I can explain everything, all right?

926
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,850
<36-17,RYAN>-都结束了  雷蒙  -不不  听着
<36-17,RYAN>- It's over, Ramon. - No, no, no, no, no. Look.

927
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,440
<36-18,RAMON>他拍了一场戏  之后他说他要离开
<36-18,RAMON>He was doing a scene, and after that, he told me he was leaving.

928
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,800
<36-18,RAMON>不是暂时离开
<36-18,RAMON>And I don't mean just for the day.

929
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,360
<36-18,RAMON>是再也不回来了
<36-18,RAMON>He was leaving for good.

930
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,930
<36-18,RAMON>他想重新开始
<36-18,RAMON>He wanted a fresh start.

931
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,260
<36-18,RAMON>他跟我一样没工作好久了
<36-18,RAMON>He had been out of work as long as me.

932
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,190
<36-18,RAMON>现在我们有机会拍电影
<36-18,RAMON>And now we had a shot at doing these movies.

933
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,480
<36-18,RAMON>不能就这样放弃机会
<36-18,RAMON>You don't walk away from that kind of opportunity,

934
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,640
<36-18,RAMON>不要这工钱
<36-18,RAMON>that kind of money!

935
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,250
<36-19,ESPOSITO>你怎么会出现在房顶
<36-19,ESPOSITO>How did you end up on the roof?

936
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,810
<36-20,RAMON>他约我在那见面
<36-20,RAMON>'cause he asked me to meet him there!

937
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,600
<36-20,RAMON>我以为他改变主意了  就去了
<36-20,RAMON>So I thought maybe he'd changed his mind, so I went.

938
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,220
<36-20,RAMON>我们站在那儿  看着风景
<36-20,RAMON>So there we were, looking at the great view.

939
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,320
<36-20,RAMON>他说我可以免费住在他的公寓
<36-20,RAMON>And he's saying to me that I can stay at his place for free.

940
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,710
<36-20,RAMON>我才不要他的怜悯
<36-20,RAMON>I don't want no charity!

941
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,090
<36-20,RAMON>我才不要给他看房子
<36-20,RAMON>I don't want to be house-sitting.

942
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,470
<36-20,RAMON>我想找回我的演艺事业  他毁了一切
<36-20,RAMON>I wanted my career back, and he ruined it!

943
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,790
<36-21,RYAN>于是你就发怒了
<36-21,RYAN>So you just snapped.

944
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,320
<36-22,RAMON>当我演那部剧时
<36-22,RAMON>You know, when I was on the show,

945
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,530
<36-22,RAMON>我有钱  姑娘  好车  名牌衣服
<36-22,RAMON>I had money--for girls, for cars, for clothes,

946
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,690
<36-22,RAMON>找啥有啥  突然  一切都没了
<36-22,RAMON>for whatever, and then, bam, all it's gone.

947
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,400
<36-22,RAMON>没有提醒你一无所有的感觉
<36-22,RAMON>And nobody tells you how it feels when it's gone, you know?

948
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,290
<36-22,RAMON>倒是有一帮人在你身边帮你花钱
<36-22,RAMON>Plenty of people around you to help you spend it, though.

949
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,790
<36-23,RAMON>我想回到那种生活
<36-23,RAMON>I just wanted my old life back.

950
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,210
<37-1,GATES>我们拿到了完整的认罪
<37-1,GATES>We're getting a full confession,

951
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,900

<37-4,BECKETT>Why is Svetlana still here?

956
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,030
<37-5,MCCORD>中情局要我们先扣留她
<37-5,MCCORD>The C.I.A. asked us to hold her.

<37-6,WRIGHT>to carry on his work.

960
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,380
<37-7,SVETLANA>你要我出卖我的家人
<37-7,SVETLANA>You are asking me to spy on my family?

961

<37-8,WRIGHT>That is extremely valuable to us.

964

<37-9,SVETLANA>你知道如果他们发现了会对我做出什么吗
<37-9,SVETLANA>Do you know what they will do to me when they learn of this?

965
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,440
<37-10,WRIGHT>他们现在就能知道
<37-10,WRIGHT>They could learn of this right now.

966
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,420
<37-10,WRIGHT>如果查理是中情局特工的消息传出
<37-10,WRIGHT>If word somehow got out that Charlie was C.I.A.,

967
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,910
<37-10,WRIGHT>你的家人会问些让你头疼的问题
<37-10,WRIGHT>your family would ask some pretty tough questions.

968
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:14,590
<37-11,SVETLANA>你为什么要这样对我
<37-11,SVETLANA>You would do this to me?

969
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,650
<37-12,WRIGHT>你如果帮我们  我就不会
<37-12,WRIGHT>Not if you help us.

970
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,130
<37-13,BECKETT>他在吓唬她
<37-13,BECKETT>He's bluffing.

971
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,940
<37-13,BECKETT>中情局不会那样暴露她的
<37-13,BECKETT>C.I.A.'s not gonna just expose her like that.

972
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,810
<37-14,MCCORD>那可不一定
<37-14,MCCORD>Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.

<37-15,BECKETT>她爱的男人被谋杀了
<37-15,BECKETT>The man that she loved was murdered,

974
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,400
<37-15,BECKETT>他还让她去执行自杀行动
<37-15,BECKETT>and he's gonna send her on a suicide mission?

975
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,700
<37-16,MCCORD>如我所说
<37-16,MCCORD>Like I said,

976
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,500
<37-16,MCCORD>我们无法总是看到大局
<37-16,MCCORD>we don't always see the whole picture.

<39-11,CASTLE>我在哪儿都可以写书  于是我就找到一个住处
<39-11,CASTLE>I can write from anywhere, so I found a place

1042
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,240
<39-11,CASTLE>有个小小的工作室
<39-11,CASTLE>with a little home office.

<39-12,BECKETT>我不用看  我非常喜欢
<39-12,BECKETT>No. I don't need to see it. I love this.

1045
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,300
<39-13,CASTLE>稍等
<39-13,CASTLE>Hold that thought. Okay.

1046
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,690
<39-14,BECKETT>我给母亲  阿丽克西斯和派买了过夜的瑜伽之旅
<39-14,BECKETT>I bought mother, Alexis, and Pi a overnight yoga retreat.

1047
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,450
<39-15,CASTLE>他们不会这么早回来
<39-15,CASTLE>They should not be home early.

1048
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,110
<39-16,CASTLE>我以为我们的航班明早8点才起飞
<39-16,CASTLE>Hey. I thought our flight was at 8:00 in the morning.

1049
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,160

<39-20,MCCORD>我呢  很敬佩你的选择
<39-20,MCCORD>A part of me really admires you for the choice that you made,

1052
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,760
<39-20,MCCORD>因为我希望当时
<39-20,MCCORD>Maybe because I'd like to think there was a time

1053
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,050
<39-20,MCCORD>我也能像你一样有这样的勇气和正义感
<39-20,MCCORD>that I would have done it.

1054
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,450
<39-20,MCCORD>但是我们的上司不这么想
<39-20,MCCORD>But the people we answer to don't feel that way.

1055
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,470
