<14-8,MIKE>不，Susan 邀请我参加她的传统的欢迎新邻居的晚餐

00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,615
<14-8,MIKE>only I'm cooking...
<14-8,MIKE>由我来做饭

313

<14-9,EDIE>Ha ha. Traditional, huh? I didn't get one.
<14-9,EDIE>哈哈，传统的，嗯？ 我怎么没有被邀请过？

315
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,582
<14-10,SUSAN>Oh, it's sort of a new tradition.
<14-10,SUSAN>哦，是新的传统

316
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,585
<14-11,MIKE>Well, it won't be anything fancy. Just a little home cooking.
<14-11,MIKE>哦，不会有什么太新奇的 只是在家做些吃的

317
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:53,712
<14-12,EDIE>That sounds so good.
<14-12,EDIE>听起来不错

318
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:57,591
<14-13,NARRATOR>Susan suddenly had an awful feeling in the pit of her stoma...
<14-13,NARRATOR>Susan突然觉得胃里非常不舒服

319
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,594
<14-14,EDIE>I've been having nothing but fast food lately.
<14-14,EDIE>最近我除了快餐还没吃过别的

320
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,805
<14-15,NARRATOR>As if she was watching an accident in slow motion.
<14-15,NARRATOR>好像她正在看一次事故的慢镜头

321
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:09,311
<14-15,NARRATOR>She knew it would happen, but was powerless to stop it.
<14-15,NARRATOR>她知道会发生什么事 却无能为力

322
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,818
<14-16,SUSAN>Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?
<14-16,SUSAN>Edie，你愿意参加我们的晚餐吗？

<14-17,EDIE>不过我不想打扰 三个人不太好

325
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:24,910
<14-18,MIKE>No, it's not like that. I mean, Susan's bringing Julie.
<14-18,MIKE>不是那样的 我是说，Susan会带Julie来

326
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,788
<14-19,SUSAN>Yeah, it's not like that.
<14-19,SUSAN>是的，不是那样的

327
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,082
<14-19,SUSAN>The more, the merrier.
<14-19,SUSAN>人越多越开心

328
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,084
<14-20,EDIE>- Well, this will be fun.
<14-20,EDIE>- 那就太好了

332
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,799
<14-22,EDIE>Oh, and, Susan...
<14-22,EDIE>－对了， Susan

333
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,799
<5-10,JULIE> Yeah.
<5-10,JULIE> 什么事？

334
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,802
<14-24,EDIE>This will make up for the dinner that you never threw me.
<14-24,EDIE>这可以弥补你欠我的那顿晚饭了

335
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:44,888
<14-26,EDIE>Right. Ha ha.
<14-26,EDIE>是的，呵

336
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,683
<14-27,MIKE>Should I have told her we were having steak?
<14-27,MIKE>我是不是该告诉她我们要吃肋排？

337
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,893
<14-27,MIKE>She's not, like, a vegetarian or something, is she?
<14-27,MIKE>她应该不会是个素食主意者 是吗？

338
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,396
<20-21,LADY>Oh, no, no.
<20-21,LADY>哦，不会，不会

339
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,399
<14-28,SUSAN>No, edie's definitely a carnivore.
<14-28,SUSAN>不，Edi绝对是个肉食动物

340
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,905
<22-3,MIKE>Here's, um...
<22-3,MIKE>这里是，嗯……

341
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,991
<14-29,LYNETTE>Here's what I pulled for Edie.
<14-29,LYNETTE>这是我为Edie准备的

342
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,910
<14-29,LYNETTE>I should warn you that most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish.
<14-29,LYNETTE>我要告诉你 大部分衣服都不是那么过时

343
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,496
<14-30,MRS HUBER>Oh, don't worry about it. Edie's a beggar now,
<14-30,MRS HUBER>哦，没关系 Edie现在是个小乞丐

344
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,915
<14-30,MRS HUBER>which means she can'be a chooser.
<14-30,MRS HUBER>就是说她不能挑三拣四的

345
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,918
<14-30,MRS HUBER>Of course, we don't have to add salt to the wound.
<14-30,MRS HUBER>当然我们也没必要 雪上加霜

346
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,213
<14-31,LYNETTE>Listen, I was just getting dinner ready.
<14-31,LYNETTE>哦，我要去做晚饭了

347
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,381
<14-32,MRS HUBER>Say no more.
<14-32,MRS HUBER>不用招呼我了

348
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,009
<14-32,MRS HUBER>- I'll get out of your hair.
<14-32,MRS HUBER>- 我不耽误你做事了

349
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,009
<14-33,LYNETTE> No, no.
<14-33,LYNETTE> 没关系

350
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,013
<14-34,MRS HUBER>By the way, was that you I saw getting pulled over by a policeman?
<14-34,MRS HUBER>对了，那天我看见有个人被警察拦下了，是你吗？

351
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,016
<14-35,LYNETTE>Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car,
<14-35,LYNETTE>是啊，小家伙们在汽车里捣乱

352
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,018
<14-35,LYNETTE>and I couldn't get them to sit down.
<14-35,LYNETTE>我没办法让他们老实呆一会

353
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,103
<14-36,MRS HUBER>Young boys can be so willful.
<14-36,MRS HUBER>小孩子们就是这样任性

354
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,813
<14-37,LYNETTE>I try everything.
<14-37,LYNETTE>我什么招都使了

355
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:38,817
<14-37,LYNETTE>I scream, I threaten, I reason, I beg. Nothing works.
<14-37,LYNETTE>大叫，威胁，讲道理，请求 但都不管用

356
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:42,487
<14-37,LYNETTE>I don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand,
<14-37,LYNETTE>我不知道是不是因为他们太小 听不懂我的意思

357
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:46,491
<14-37,LYNETTE>or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me.
<14-37,LYNETTE>他们不断的挑战我从中取乐

358
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,203
<14-38,MRS HUBER>My mother used to have the worst time with me in the car,
<14-38,MRS HUBER>我妈妈过去也总为我在车里捣乱而头疼不已

359
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,914
<14-38,MRS HUBER>so one time when I was acting up, she stopped
<14-38,MRS HUBER>有一次我不听话的时候 她停下车

360
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,917
<14-38,MRS HUBER>and left me on the side of the road, and she drove off.
<14-38,MRS HUBER>把我扔在路边 然后把车开走了

361
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:58,587
<14-39,LYNETTE>You're kidding.
<14-39,LYNETTE>你在开玩笑吧

362
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,506
<14-40,MRS HUBER>Oh, she came back immediately,
<14-40,MRS HUBER>不过，她很快就回来了

363
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,883
<14-40,MRS HUBER>but I never misbehaved in the car again.
<14-40,MRS HUBER>从那以后我就老实了

364
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,384
<14-40,MRS HUBER>You should try that.
<14-40,MRS HUBER>你也可以试试

365
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:08,180
<14-41,LYNETTE>Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids by the side of the road.
<14-41,LYNETTE>Huber夫人，我不可能把我的孩子丢在路边

366
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,183
<14-42,MRS HUBER>When it comes to discipline, sometimes you must be creative.
<14-42,MRS HUBER>在教育孩子守规矩的时候 你要有些创意

367
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,810
<14-42,MRS HUBER>My mother knew that. Smart lady.
<14-42,MRS HUBER>我妈妈就懂得这一点 她是个聪明的母亲

368
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,604
<14-42,MRS HUBER>Of course, she's in a home now,
<14-42,MRS HUBER>当然，她现在已经不在人世了

369
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:18,607
<14-42,MRS HUBER>and her mind has just turned to mush.
<14-42,MRS HUBER>但她的想法确实很管用

370
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,403
<14-43,LYNETTE>Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready.
<14-43,LYNETTE>我差点忘了，我要回去准备晚饭了

371
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,406
<14-25,SUSAN>Oh, right, right.
<14-25,SUSAN>好吧

372
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,409
<14-45,LYNETTE>- Goodbye.
<14-45,LYNETTE>- 再见

373
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,409
<14-45,LYNETTE> Goodbye.
<14-45,LYNETTE> 再见

374
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,996
<14-46,MRS HUBER>Susan, have you been able to find old clothes for Edie?
<14-46,MRS HUBER>Susan，你能给Edie找一些旧衣服吗？

375
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,915
<14-46,MRS HUBER>She has nothing to wear.
<14-46,MRS HUBER>她没的穿了

376
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,417
<14-47,SUSAN>I thought that was the look she was going for.
<14-47,SUSAN>我还以为她故意穿成那样呢

377
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,585
<14-22,EDIE>Oh, Susan.
<14-22,EDIE>哦, Susan

378
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,588
<14-48,MRS HUBER>Edie may be trash, but she's still a human being.
<14-48,MRS HUBER>Edie may be trash, but she's still a human being. Edie也许善乏可陈 但还是人性未泯

379
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,813
<14-49,SUSAN>Zach? Is your dad home?
<14-49,SUSAN>Zach？你爸爸在家吗？

380
00:23:57,813 --> 00:24:00,816
<14-49,SUSAN>I need to talk to him.
<14-49,SUSAN>我需要和他谈谈

381
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,283
<14-50,SUSAN>- Hey, Paul.
<14-50,SUSAN>- 嗨, Paul

<14-56,SUSAN>我能想到

389
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,883
<14-56,SUSAN>I mean, not knowing why Mary Alice...
<14-56,SUSAN>我是说，不知道Mary Alice为什么……

<14-57,PAUL>Why what?
<14-57,PAUL>什么为什么？

396
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:47,321
<14-63,PAUL>I don't care what her reasons were.
<14-63,PAUL>我不在乎到底为什么

397
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,489
<14-63,PAUL>Maybe she was depressed, maybe she was bored.
<14-63,PAUL>也许她很消沉 也许她厌倦了生活

398
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,116
<25-21,SUSAN>It doesn't matter.
<25-21,SUSAN>这些都不重要

<14-64,NARRATOR>我看着Susan的时候 忍不住为她感到悲哀

<15-1,NARRATOR>为什么要自杀

403
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,113
<15-1,NARRATOR>It's not enough to want the truth.
<15-1,NARRATOR>但光是想知道还不够

404
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,117
<15-1,NARRATOR>You must know where to look for it.
<15-1,NARRATOR>你必须清楚在哪儿能够找到事实

405
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,083
<15-1,NARRATOR>And the truth is elusive, because it knows where to hide.
<15-1,NARRATOR>但事实并不是那么显而易见的 因为它清楚该隐藏在哪

406
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,883
<14-54,SUSAN>Hello, Julie.
<14-54,SUSAN>你好，Julie
