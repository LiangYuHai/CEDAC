<15-14,Andrew>And I also feel bad that now I'm going to have to ride my bike to school.
<15-14,Andrew>而且我还觉得我要骑车上学很难过

<19-12,Susan>恩,我们可能不应该约会

545
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,500
<19-12,Susan>Maybe we shouldn't.
<19-12,Susan>可能我们是不应该

546
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,500
<19-14,Susan>Do you mean that?
<19-14,Susan>你认真的吗?

547
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,800
<0-0,None>Yeah.
<0-0,None>是的

548

<19-16,Susan>因为你扔掉了一些重要的东西来保护它.

<19-17,Lynette>Susan, you got to take my kids for a while.
<19-17,Lynette>Susan, 你能帮我看一下孩子吗?

<19-18,Susan>Lynette, 现在真不是时候

552
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,700
<19-19,Lynette>no, no, I'm sorry, but I can't do this.
<19-19,Lynette>不,不,对不起,但我做不了

<19-19,Lynette>It's just --it's too much.
<19-19,Lynette>那只是,只是太多了

<20-2,Susan>我希望对Danielle来说孩子们不是太难搞定.

<20-4,Susan>有些事真的很不对劲.

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,600
<0-0,None>Lynette, honey?
<0-0,None>Lynette, 亲爱的?

<21-3,Gabrielle>听着,自从你在这儿

<21-3,Gabrielle>there's something I've always wondered about.
<21-3,Gabrielle>有些事我真的很想知道

572
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,500
<21-3,Gabrielle>That whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions --
<21-3,Gabrielle>整件事是牧师们不被允许重复他们所听到的忏悔词..

573
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,000
<21-3,Gabrielle>is that a hard rule or just a general guide line?
<21-3,Gabrielle>是一个艰难的角色又或者只是个总的指引线路?

574
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,100
<21-4,Father Crowley>Rest assured, everyone's secrets are safe.
<21-4,Father Crowley>放心,每个人的秘密都是安全的

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,900
<21-5,Gabrielle>That's good to hear.
<21-5,Gabrielle>听到这个太好了.

576
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,600
<21-6,Father Crowley>I'll keep yours, too, if you want to talk.
<21-6,Father Crowley>我也会保守你的,如果你要说的话

577
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,500
<21-7,Gabrielle>Oh, me?
<21-7,Gabrielle>哦,我?

578
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
<21-7,Gabrielle>No, no.
<21-7,Gabrielle>不,不

579
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
<21-7,Gabrielle>Confession's not really my thing.
<21-7,Gabrielle>忏悔真的不是我的事

580
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,600
<22-5,Bree>That's a shame.
<22-5,Bree>那是个可耻的事

581
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,500
<21-9,Gabrielle>Okay, you can stop condemning me with your eyes.
<21-9,Gabrielle>好了,你可以停止用你的眼睛谴责我了.

582
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,700
<21-9,Gabrielle>Right now.
<21-9,Gabrielle>现在

583
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,000
<21-9,Gabrielle>I know you know about the affair,
<21-9,Gabrielle>我知道你知道我的事

584
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,800
<21-9,Gabrielle>but you know nothing about my life.
<21-9,Gabrielle>但是你对我的生活一无所知

585
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,500
<21-9,Gabrielle>Look, it's not even an issue anymore. John and I are finished.
<21-9,Gabrielle>瞧,那甚至不再是一件事了,John和我结束了

586
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,300
<21-10,Father Crowley>Gabrielle, the church is pretty clear on this.
<21-10,Father Crowley>Gabrielle, 教堂是很纯洁的

587
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,000
<21-10,Father Crowley>If you commit a mortal sin and you die without repenting,
<21-10,Father Crowley>如果你犯了不可饶恕的罪你会因为没有忏悔而死的

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,700
<21-10,Father Crowley>you go to hell.
<21-10,Father Crowley>你会下地狱

589
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,000
<21-11,Gabrielle>Well, aren't you just a ball of fun.
<21-11,Gabrielle>好啊,你难道只有找乐子的胆啊

590
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,800
<21-11,Gabrielle>So if I confess, it'll clean the slate, right?
<21-11,Gabrielle>所以如果我承认了,那就会了结往事,对吗?

591
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,900
<21-12,Father Crowley>Not only that.
<21-12,Father Crowley>不止那样

592
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,700
<21-12,Father Crowley>If you want god's forgiveness, you have to be truly sorry,
<21-12,Father Crowley>如果你要上帝的原谅的话,你就得真的感到抱歉

593
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,800
<21-12,Father Crowley>and you have to promise not to commit the sin again.
<21-12,Father Crowley>而且你还得保证不再犯

594
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,300
<21-13,Gabrielle>So what happens if I repent later,
<21-13,Gabrielle>如果我忏悔的晚些会怎么样?

595
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,400
<21-13,Gabrielle>like, say, when I'm 75?
<21-13,Gabrielle>像是,我75岁的时候说

596
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,500
<21-14,Father Crowley>I wouldn't recommend waiting. What if you die before then?
<21-14,Father Crowley>我不建议等待,如果你在那之前就死了呢?

597
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,300
<21-15,Gabrielle>Well, let's say I don't die.
<21-15,Gabrielle>恩,就想我不会死

598
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,000
<21-15,Gabrielle>I do yoga, I eat well.
<21-15,Gabrielle>我做榆枷,我吃好的

599
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,300
<21-15,Gabrielle>If I wait, does my repenting still count?
<21-15,Gabrielle>如果我等,我的忏悔还有效吗?

600
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,200
<21-16,Father Crowley>If you mean it, yes.
<21-16,Father Crowley>如果你真的想,是的

601
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
<21-17,Gabrielle>Thank you, father Crowley.
<21-17,Gabrielle>谢谢你,Crowley神父

602
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,900
<21-17,Gabrielle>You have been a tremendous comfort.
<21-17,Gabrielle>你是个很好的安慰者

603
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,300
<21-17,Gabrielle>Um, I will let you do your thing.
<21-17,Gabrielle>恩..我会让你做些事

604
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,900
<0-0,None>Gabrielle.
<0-0,None>Gabrielle.

605
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,000
<21-18,Father Crowley>You know, we're all responsible for the choices we make.
<21-18,Father Crowley>你知道,我们对我们做的选择有全部责任

606
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,300
<21-18,Father Crowley>Don't you want to be a good person?
<21-18,Father Crowley>你真的想做个好人吗?

607
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,800
<21-19,Gabrielle>What I want is to be happy.
<21-19,Gabrielle>我想做的只是快乐

608
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,500
<21-20,Father Crowley>That's the answer of a selfish child.
<21-20,Father Crowley>那是个自私小孩的答案.

609
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,900
<21-9,Gabrielle>I know.
<21-9,Gabrielle>我知道

610
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
<22-1,Lynette>Then I started taking the pills because they gave me energy,
<22-1,Lynette>然后我要开始吃药因为它给我能量.

611
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
<22-1,Lynette>but then I couldn't sleep at night,
<22-1,Lynette>但是我那之后睡不着

612
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,300
<22-1,Lynette>and I was getting so tired in the daytime,
<22-1,Lynette>然后我在白天就很累

613
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,300
<22-1,Lynette>and it totally messed me up.
<22-1,Lynette>那真的让我很乱

614

<22-1,Lynette>I love my kids so much.
<22-1,Lynette>我很爱我的孩子

<22-1,Lynette>我很抱歉他们有我这样一个母亲

<22-2,Bree>Lynette, you are a great mother.
<22-2,Bree>Lynette, 你是个伟大的母亲.

617
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
<21-7,Gabrielle>No, I'm not.
<21-7,Gabrielle>不,我不是

618
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,800
<22-3,Lynette>I can't do it.
<22-3,Lynette>我做不到

619
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,700
<22-3,Lynette>I'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
<22-3,Lynette>我不想再有作为一个失败者的感觉

620
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,000
<22-6,Lynette>It's so humiliating.
<22-6,Lynette>那是很羞耻的

621
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
<21-7,Gabrielle>No, it's not.
<21-7,Gabrielle>不,它不是

622
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
<22-4,Susan>So you got addicted to your kids' A.D.D. medication.
<22-4,Susan>你对你孩子的A.D.D药物治疗上瘾了.

623
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,500
<21-13,Gabrielle>It happens.
<21-13,Gabrielle>它发生了

<22-5,Bree>亲爱的,你只是需要一些帮助.

626
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,600
<22-6,Lynette>That's what's so humiliating.
<22-6,Lynette>那就是很羞耻的

627
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
<22-6,Lynette>Other moms don't need help.
<22-6,Lynette>别的母亲不需要帮助

<22-6,Lynette>Other moms make it look so easy.
<22-6,Lynette>别的母亲看起来很容易

<22-6,Lynette>All I do is complain.
<22-6,Lynette>我所做的所有事就只是抱怨.

630
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,800
<22-7,Susan>That's not true.
<22-7,Susan>那不是真的

631

<22-7,Susan>When -- when Julie was a baby,
<22-7,Susan>当,当Julie还是个小孩的时候

<22-7,Susan>I-I was out of my mind almost every day.
<22-7,Susan>我每天几乎快要失去理智了

<22-8,Bree>I used to get so upset when Andrew and Danielle were little,
<22-8,Bree>我经常很不安当Andrew和Danielle都很小的时候

<22-9,Lynette>你们干吗从不跟我说这个?
