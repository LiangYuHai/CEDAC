00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,100
<10-1,Lynette>I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck.
<10-1,Lynette>我的意思是，Claire昨天和孩子们相处得很好， 但那可能是初学者的运气

214
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,000
<10-1,Lynette>You think I should call? I should call.
<10-1,Lynette>你认为我应该打个电话吗？我应该打一个

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,700
<10-2,Bree>Lynette, for the first time in years, you finally have some free time,
<10-2,Bree>Lynette, 在这么多年来你终于有了一些自由时间

216
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,000
<10-2,Bree>and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids.
<10-2,Bree>而你却把它浪费在担心你的孩子上

217
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,000
<10-3,Lynette>It's just I don't know this woman. I mean, not really.
<10-3,Lynette>关键是我不了解这个女人，我的意思是，不真正了解

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,700
<10-3,Lynette>So she has a degree in sociology. Well, big deal. Who doesn't?
<10-3,Lynette>她有社会学学位 那又怎么样，谁没有呢？

219

<10-3,Lynette>我的孩子们很难管理 要是她搞不定怎么办？

220

<10-4,Bree>You know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera.
<10-4,Bree>我说，如果你真的有那么多的疑问， 你应该去买个隐藏的摄像器

221

<10-7,Lynette>我觉得我不能监视Claire, 这是一种不信任

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,000
<35-1,Mary Alice Voiceover>Trust is overrated.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,800
<10-11,Lynette>Well, I'm just curious. I mean, he moves out, moves back in. Is he back for good?

<10-13,Lynette>那么如果你不确定他搬回来是出于好的原因， 为什么你还熨他的寸衫呢

234
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,000
<10-14,Bree>Because I have faith that he'll come back
