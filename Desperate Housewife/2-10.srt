<17-14,Carlos>He's being a real mensch about this.
<17-14,Carlos>这件事上他一直都很支持我

<17-15,Gabrielle>I may be a catholic,but I am so not above slapping a nun.
<17-15,Gabrielle>但我实在忍不住要抽你这修女一耳光

<17-16,Sister Mary>使点劲 留下个手掌印

436

<17-16,Sister Mary>Yeah. I didn't think so.
<17-16,Sister Mary>谅你也不敢打

<18-2,Ed>日托的事我很抱歉 lynette

440
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,980
<18-2,Ed>but Fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.
<18-2,Ed>但是fran几乎不让我抱孩子

441
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,210
<18-2,Ed>You know,since day one,all I ever got was,
<18-2,Ed>你知道嘛 自打第一天起 我能做的就是听她说

<18-2,Ed>"support the head,support the head."
<18-2,Ed>“托住头部 托住头部”

443
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,420
<18-2,Ed>I think I know how to support a damn baby head.
<18-2,Ed>我难道连个婴儿的头 都不知道怎么托住吗？！

444

<18-2,Ed>I don't want to be here all night.
<18-2,Ed>我可不想一晚上都呆在这

446
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,130
<18-3,Lynette>you're Mindy's father.
<18-3,Lynette>可你是mindy的父亲啊

<18-4,Ed>我知道 可我又能如何呢？

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
<18-5,Lynette>You could stand up to Fran.
<18-5,Lynette>你应该直面fran

450

<18-5,Lynette>If you don't,you'll just become more resentful,
<18-5,Lynette>你要不这样 你就会越来越充满怨恨

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,720
<18-5,Lynette>she'll get nuttier.
<18-5,Lynette>而fran也会越来越得寸进尺

452
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,450
<18-5,Lynette>And without a father figure,
<18-5,Lynette>而且孩子成长中没有父亲陪伴

<18-5,Lynette>poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper.
<18-5,Lynette>可怜的mindy长大后 很可能成为一个脱衣舞女

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,120
<20-14,Ed>A stripper?
<20-14,Ed>跳脱衣舞？

455
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,920
<18-7,Lynette>There's science to back that up.
<18-7,Lynette>这可是科学研究证明的

456
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,310
<18-8,Ed>You know what?
<18-8,Ed>好吧

457
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,690
<18-8,Ed>You go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette,
<18-8,Ed>你继续张罗日托的事 lynette

458
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,950
<18-8,Ed>and count Mindy in.
<18-8,Ed>把mindy也算上

<20-9,Ed>Yeah,I'll handle Fran.
<20-9,Ed>我来对付fran

<18-9,Lynette>You're doing the right thing, Ed,
<18-9,Lynette>为了小mindy 你算是做了件好事

461
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,700
<19-1,Justin>dude,what if your mom walks in?
<19-1,Justin>要是你老妈突然进来怎么办？

462
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,070
<20-2,Lynette>She won't.
<20-2,Lynette>她不会的

463
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,040
<19-3,Justin>You don't know that.
<19-3,Justin>这可说不准

464
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,280
<19-3,Justin>Just wait till everybody's asleep.
<19-3,Justin>还是等他们都睡着了吧

465
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,860
<19-3,Justin>Seriously.
<19-3,Justin>说真的

466
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,710
<19-3,Justin>I'll make it worth your while.
<19-3,Justin>我不会让你白等的

467
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,510
<20-39,Lynette>You better.
<20-39,Lynette>那最好了

468
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,380
<19-4,Andrew>I wish she would walk in on us,
<19-4,Andrew>我倒希望她能突然进来

469
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,960
<19-4,Andrew>just to see the expression on her face.
<19-4,Andrew>到时候看她什么表情

470
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,030
<19-4,Andrew>God,I hate her so much.
<19-4,Andrew>我恨死她了

471
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,410
<19-5,Justin>Still, though,she's your mother.
<19-5,Justin>不过她怎么说也是你老妈呀

472
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,630
<19-5,Justin>Don't you sort of have to love her?
<19-5,Justin>儿子不是应该爱老妈嘛？

473
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,970
<19-6,Andrew>Last year,when she found out that I like guys,
<19-6,Andrew>去年 她知道我喜欢男的 惊恐的要命

474
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,500
<19-6,Andrew>she freaked out.
<19-6,Andrew>去年 她知道我喜欢男的 惊恐的要命

475
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:48,340
<19-6,Andrew>She said that if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell,
<19-6,Andrew>她说我要是不悔改 我就要下地狱

476
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,040
<19-6,Andrew>so since I knew that I couldn't change,
<19-6,Andrew>既然我没法改 我就想

477
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,720
<19-6,Andrew>one day,my own mother was gonna stop loving me,
<19-6,Andrew>既然我妈不爱我了

478
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,770
<19-6,Andrew>so I decided to stop loving her first.
<19-6,Andrew>我也没必要爱她了

479
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,400
<19-6,Andrew>That way,it wouldn't hurt so bad.
<19-6,Andrew>这样的话 大家心里也就平衡了

480
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,150
<19-7,Justin>She didn't know what she was saying.
<19-7,Justin>她说那话也许不是当真的

481
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,550
<19-8,Andrew>Yes,she did,
<19-8,Andrew>不 就是当真的

482
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,580
<19-8,Andrew>so now she's gotto be punished.
<19-8,Andrew>她要为此受到惩罚

483
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,190
<19-9,Justin>How are you gonna punish her?
<19-9,Justin>那你怎么罚她？

484
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,940
<19-10,Andrew>One day,she'll slip up,
<19-10,Andrew>她终有一天会疏忽

485
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,740
<19-10,Andrew>and I'll have something against her
<19-10,Andrew>到时候我就有她的把柄抓在手中

486
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,500
<19-10,Andrew>and when that happens,
<19-10,Andrew>只要有了这个

487
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,400
<19-10,Andrew>I'm gonna take her down so hard,she'll never get back up.
<19-10,Andrew>我就可以一下子击倒她 让她永世不得翻身

488
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,280
<19-11,Justin>It may take you a while to get something on her.
<19-11,Justin>要想抓她把柄可不容易啊

489
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,570
<20-35,Fran>That's Okay.
<20-35,Fran>没关系

490
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,280
<19-12,Andrew>I don't mind waiting for the things that I want.
<19-12,Andrew>等待自己期待的东西 我有耐心

491
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,830
<20-1,Ed>Lynette,hey,hey.Look who's here.
<20-1,Ed>Lynette 嘿嘿 看看谁来了

492
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,820
<20-2,Lynette>You know,the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.
<20-2,Lynette>可日托用的房间最早 也得下周才能准备好呀

493
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,190
<20-3,Ed>If I had waited,I might have lost my nerve.
<20-3,Ed>我要是再等下去 就快疯了

494
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,750
<20-3,Ed>I had a window.
<20-3,Ed>我逮着了一个机会

495

<20-3,Ed>Fran was in the shower,so I just grabbed the baby and ran.
<20-3,Ed>Fran在洗澡  所以我就趁机把孩子带出来

<20-4,Lynette>You took the baby without telling Fran?
<20-4,Lynette>你没告诉fran就把孩子带出来了？

497
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,470
<20-5,Ed>I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.
<20-5,Ed>我可不想被那个女人欺压  你说的没错,Mindy是我的女儿
