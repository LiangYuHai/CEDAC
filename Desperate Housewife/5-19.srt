1
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,434
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>So i'm driving my car the other night,
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>那天晚上  我正开着车

2

<1-1,Edie Voiceover>And what do you think happens?
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>知道发生什么了吗

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,300
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>I crashed into a utility pole.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>我撞到了电线杆上

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,400

<1-1,Edie Voiceover>It was one of those days.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>就那么发生了

8
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,434
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>All my neighbors heard it happen,
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>所有邻居都听到了

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:29,667
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>So they quickly left their microwaved burritos...
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>她们很快放下了卷饼

10
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:34,200
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>And their expensive jars of moisturizer...
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>价格不菲的润肤霜

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:38,968
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>And their racy pay-per-view movies...
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>计费电影

12
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,601
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>And they hurried outside,
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>冲到外面

13
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,601
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>Excited to see what all the ruckus was about.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>想知道究竟发生了什么事

14
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,968
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>But then, when they saw it was me,
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>她们看到是我时

15
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,934
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>This weird thing happened.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>奇怪的事情发生了

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,033
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>For a moment, no one moved or said anything.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>片刻寂静  大家站着不动

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,367
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>They just stared.
<1-1,Edie Voiceover>只是盯着我

18
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,667
<3-12,Gabrielle>And then...
<3-12,Gabrielle>然后

19
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,300
<1-2,Gabrielle>Oh, my god.
<1-2,Gabrielle>天哪

20
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,133
<1-3,Edie Voiceover>All hell broke loose.
<1-3,Edie Voiceover>大家一阵躁动

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
<1-4,Katherine>Does anybody know c.p.r.?
<1-4,Katherine>有人懂心肺复苏吗

22
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,434
<1-5,Lee>There's been an accident.

26
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:14,834
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>Which was touching,
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>这很让我感动

27
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,100
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>But ultimately pointless.
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>但最终还是无济于事

28
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,567
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>Moments before the ambulance finally arrived,
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>急救车到达之前

29
00:01:23,634 --> 00:01:26,133
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>I heard someone whisper...
<1-6,Edie Voiceover>我听到有人小声说
