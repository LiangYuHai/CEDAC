17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,170
<1-1,Monica>这没什么好说的
<1-1,Monica>There's nothing to tell!

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,040
<1-1,Monica>他不过是我的同事
<1-1,Monica>He's just some guy I work with!

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,290
<1-2,Joey>少来了  你们都在约会了
<1-2,Joey>C'mon, you're going out with the guy!

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,340
<1-2,Joey>这个男人一定有什么问题
<1-2,Joey>There's gotta be something wrong with him!

21
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,910
<1-3,Chandler>他是驼背吗  戴着假发的驼背
<1-3,Chandler>So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,570
<1-4,Phoebe>等等  他吃粉笔吗
<1-4,Phoebe>Wait, does he eat chalk?

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,420
<1-5,Phoebe>我只是不想你
<1-5,Phoebe>Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,090
<1-5,Phoebe>重蹈我和卡尔的覆辙
<1-5,Phoebe>what I went through with Carl

25
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,320
<1-6,Monica>拜托各位  放松点  这甚至不算是约会
<1-6,Monica>Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-6,Monica>只不过是两个人出去吃个饭
<1-6,Monica>It's just two people going out to dinner

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,630
<1-6,Monica>而且不会上床
<1-6,Monica>and not having sex.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,540
<1-7,Chandler>听起来像是和我约会
<1-7,Chandler>Sounds like a date to me.

29
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,400
<1-8,Chandler>于是我回到了高中学校
<1-8,Chandler>Alright, so I'm back in high school,

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,990
<1-8,Chandler>我站在食堂中间
<1-8,Chandler>I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,610
<1-8,Chandler>然后发现自己全身赤裸
<1-8,Chandler>and I realize I am totally naked.

32
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,280
<1-9,All>噢  做过那种梦
<1-9,All>Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,530
<1-10,Chandler>然后我低下头  看见那里有一部
<1-10,Chandler>Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone

34
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,450
<1-10,Chandler>大哥大
<1-10,Chandler>there.

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,000
<1-11,Joey>-那话儿变成了  -没错

<1-13,Joey>-这种梦倒从未做过  -没有
<1-13,Joey>- Never had that dream. - No.

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,500
<1-15,Chandler>突然  那电话响起来了
<1-15,Chandler>All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,650
<1-16,Monica>结果是我妈打来的
<1-16,Monica>And it turns out it's my mother,

39
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,180
<1-17,Chandler>这非常非常奇怪
<1-17,Chandler>which is very-very weird because-

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,700
<1-17,Chandler>因为她从来不打电话给我
<1-17,Chandler>she never calls me!

41
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,770
<1-18,Ross>嗨

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,770
<1-21,Ross>我感觉有人把手伸入我的喉咙
<1-21,Ross>I just feel like someone reached down my throat

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,630
<1-21,Ross>抓住我的小肠
<1-21,Ross>grabbed my small intestine,

46
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,820
<1-21,Ross>从我嘴里扯出来
<1-21,Ross>pulled it out of my mouth

47
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,010
<1-21,Ross>然后缠在我脖子上
<1-21,Ross>and tied it around my neck...

<1-49,Monica>Oh, God...well,

87
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,990
<1-50,Rachel>大概在婚礼前半个小时
<1-50,Rachel>it started about a half hour before the wedding.

88
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,190
<1-50,Rachel>我当时在存放礼品的房间里
<1-50,Rachel>I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents,

89
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,600
<1-50,Rachel>看着调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>and I was looking at this gravy boat.

90
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,730
<1-50,Rachel>那是一件极其美丽的里摩日细瓷调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

91
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,750
<1-50,Rachel>然后  突然间
<1-50,Rachel>When all of a sudden

92
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,650
<1-50,Rachel>有糖吗
<1-50,Rachel>Sweet 'n' Lo?

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,410
<1-50,Rachel>我发现我对这个调味汁瓶
<1-50,Rachel>I realized that I was more turned on

94
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,760
<1-50,Rachel>比巴瑞更能引发我的兴奋感
<1-50,Rachel>by this gravy boat than by Barry!

95
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,730
<1-50,Rachel>然后我真的吓坏了
<1-50,Rachel>And then I got really freaked out,

96
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,070
<1-50,Rachel>突然想到
<1-50,Rachel>and that's when it hit me:

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,790
<1-50,Rachel>巴瑞真的超像薯头先生
<1-50,Rachel>how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,330
<1-50,Rachel>我是说  我总是觉得他眼熟
<1-50,Rachel>Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar,

99
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,700
<1-50,Rachel>但是
<1-50,Rachel>but...

100
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,970
<1-50,Rachel>不管怎么说  我必须离开那里
<1-50,Rachel>Anyway, I just had to get out of there,

101
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,630
<1-50,Rachel>我开始想
<1-50,Rachel>and I started wondering

102
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,380
<1-50,Rachel>"我干吗这么做  我这么做是为了谁"
<1-50,Rachel>"Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?"

103
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,120
<1-50,Rachel>不管怎么说  我不知该去哪里
<1-50,Rachel>So anyway I just didn't know where to go,

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,200
<1-50,Rachel>而且我知道我们有点疏远了
<1-50,Rachel>and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart,

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,370
<1-50,Rachel>但是  你是我在这个城市
<1-50,Rachel>but you're the only person I knew

106
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,990
<1-50,Rachel>唯一认识的人
<1-50,Rachel>who lived here in the city.

107
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,910
<1-51,Monica>还没有被邀请参加婚礼
<1-51,Monica>Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

108
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,530
<1-52,Rachel>噢  我希望这不是个问题
<1-52,Rachel>Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,930
<2-1,Monica>我猜他送她一台管风琴
<2-1,Monica>Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ,

110
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,800
<2-1,Monica>而她很不喜欢
<2-1,Monica>and she's really not happy about it.

111
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,670
<2-4,Rachel>爸爸  我只是  不能嫁给他
<2-4,Rachel>Daddy, I just... I can't marry him!

112
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,720
<2-4,Rachel>对不起  我只是不爱他
<2-4,Rachel>I'm sorry. I just don't love him.

113
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,180
<2-4,Rachel>可是对我来说就有关系
<2-4,Rachel>Well, it matters to me!

114
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,320
<2-6,Chandler>噢  她真不应该穿那条裤子
<2-6,Chandler>Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.

115
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,960
<2-7,Joey>要我说  推她下楼
<2-7,Joey>I say push her down the stairs.

116
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,690
<2-7,Joey>推她下楼  把推她下楼  把推她下楼
<2-7,Joey>Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

117

<2-8,Rachel>爸  你听我说
<2-8,Rachel>C'mon Daddy, listen to me!

118
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,730

<11-36,Monica>It's like, it's like, all of my life,

119
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,810
<2-8,Rachel>所有人都一直告诉我"你是一只鞋子
<2-8,Rachel>everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!

<2-8,Rachel>你是鞋子  你是鞋子  你是鞋子
<2-8,Rachel>You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'.

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,180
<2-8,Rachel>可今天我停下来说
<2-8,Rachel>And today I just stopped and I said,

122
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,790
<2-8,Rachel>"如果我不想成为一只鞋呢"
<2-8,Rachel>'What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

123
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,690
<2-8,Rachel>如果我想当一个包包  或是一顶帽子呢
<2-8,Rachel>What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat!

124
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,230

<2-8,Rachel>No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat,

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600

<2-11,Monica>我猜和莫妮卡一起住的人选已然敲定了
<2-11,Monica>Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

131
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,880

132
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,280
<2-12,Rachel>也许我不需要你的钱

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,500

<2-16,Monica>Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know?

143
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,300

<7-8,Ross>我真不晓得现在自己是真饿了还是欲火难耐
<7-8,Ross>I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

233
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,980
<7-8,Ross>离我的冰箱远点
<7-8,Ross>Stay out of my freezer!

236
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,140
<8-3,Paul>不  这该是第五次约会时候才说的事儿
<8-3,Paul>No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

237
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,780
<8-4,Monica>噢  这么说会有第五次约会了
<8-4,Monica>Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

<8-6,Monica>What were you gonna say?

241

242
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,170
<8-7,Paul>我就一直无法过
<8-7,Paul>um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.

243
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,730

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,870
<8-10,Monica>我知道你现在需要的必然不是被人喷一身水
<8-10,Monica>I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

247
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,430
<8-11,Paul>-多久了  -两年了
<8-11,Paul>- Um... how long? - Two years.

<9-2,Rachel>Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon?

255
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,670
<10-1,Ross>难道"比利  别逞英雄"这句话对你没意义
<10-1,Ross>Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

257
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,220
<10-2,Joey>还有个问题

<10-4,Joey>Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,...

259
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,810
<10-5,Ross>我又能约谁呢

<11-6,Joey>If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something..

265
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,210

<11-18,Joey>那还不叫真正的约会
<11-18,Joey>That wasn't a real date?!

273
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,670
<11-18,Joey>那你真正的约会到底要干些什么
<11-18,Joey>What the hell do you do on a real date?

274
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,150
<11-19,Monica>-闭嘴  把桌子抬回去  -好啦

277
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,940
<11-21,Chandler>也没什么关系
<11-21,Chandler>it doesn't make much of a difference...

278

280
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,030

283
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,750
<11-26,Joey>难说  大部分范围都挺小的
<11-26,Joey>I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

284
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,650
<11-27,Monica>等下  除非你碰巧看过

294
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,420
<11-33,Rachel>你活像昨晚睡觉时嘴里放了个撑衣架
<11-33,Rachel>You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

302
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,030
<11-40,Monica>或者只是站起来去工作

<12-8,Monica>You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

315
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,000
<12-9,Frannie>开玩笑吧  保罗还欠我一个人情呢

<13-2,Monica>为什么  为什么会有人那样做
<13-2,Monica>Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?

319

<13-3,Ross>我想你是想让我们拿出一个
<13-3,Ross>I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated

320
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,440
<13-3,Ross>比"想和你上床"更为复杂的回答
<13-3,Ross>than 'to get you into bed'.

321
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,890
<13-6,Monica>问题出在我身上
<13-6,Monica>Is it me?

322
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,830
<13-6,Monica>难道我身上带着某种味儿
<13-6,Monica>Is it like I have some sort of beacon

326
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,650
<13-9,Joey>我真不相信  你不知道那是个谎言
<13-9,Joey>I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,210
<13-11,Ross>-猜猜怎么了  -你找到工作了
<13-11,Ross>- Guess what?  - You got a job?

328
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,380

<13-13,Chandler>不过你却异常兴奋
<13-13,Chandler>And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

331
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,370
<13-14,Rachel>如果你遇见"约翰&大卫"的皮靴打五折
<13-14,Rachel>You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale,

332
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,280
<13-14,Rachel>也会跟我一样的
<13-14,Rachel>fifty percent off!

340
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,950
<14-2,Monica>拜托  你不能靠你爸一辈子
<14-2,Monica>C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.

341

<14-4,Phoebe>饶了她吧  第一次独立并不轻松
<14-4,Phoebe>Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.

343

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,900
<14-3,Rachel>当时我十四岁
<14-3,Rachel>I was fourteen.

346
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,910
<14-6,Phoebe>我妈刚自杀  我继父再度入狱
<14-6,Phoebe>My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison,

347
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,230
<14-6,Phoebe>我来到这里  举目无亲
<14-6,Phoebe>and I got here, and I didn't know anybody.

348
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,630

<14-6,Phoebe>cleaning windshields outside port authority,

350
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,900
<14-6,Phoebe>后来他也自杀了
<14-6,Phoebe>and then he killed himself,

351
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,000
<14-6,Phoebe>然后我成了按摩师
<14-6,Phoebe>and then I found aromatherapy.

352

<14-6,Phoebe>所以相信我  我完全了解你的感受
