<1-3,Ross>嘿  对了  约会怎么样
<1-3,Ross>Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,740
<1-4,Phoebe>不是很好  他送我到地铁然后说
<1-4,Phoebe>Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,160
<1-5,All>"我们应该再来一次"
<1-5,All>'We should do this again!'

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,490
<1-6,Rachel>怎么啦  他说要再来一次那不是很好吗
<1-6,Rachel>What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,230
<1-7,Monica>不  他说我们应该再来一次
<1-7,Monica>Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again'

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,380
<1-7,Monica>代表你将无法再见到裸体的我
<1-7,Monica>means 'You will never see me naked'.

9
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,760
<1-8,Rachel>什么时候这样子的
<1-8,Rachel>Since when?

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,120
<1-9,Joey>一直都是这样  这是约会用语
<1-9,Joey>Since always. It's like dating language.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,040
<1-9,Joey>就像"不是你的问题"代表"就是你"
<1-9,Joey>Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,950
<1-10,Chandler>"你真的挺好的"代表
<1-10,Chandler>Or 'You're such a nice guy' means

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,170
<1-10,Chandler>"我要和穿皮衣的酒鬼约会"
<1-10,Chandler>'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,650
<1-10,Chandler>然后再跟你抱怨他们"
<1-10,Chandler>and complaining about them to you

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,600
<1-11,Phoebe>还有还有  "我们该试试别人"代表
<1-11,Phoebe>Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,570
<1-11,Phoebe>"哈哈  我已和别人约会了"
<1-11,Phoebe>'Ha, ha, I already am'.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,250
<1-13,Joey>-大家都懂  -对  放轻松啦
<1-13,Joey>- And everybody knows this? - Yeah. Cushions the blow.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,380
<1-14,Chandler>没错就像你小时候
<1-14,Chandler>Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,950
<1-14,Chandler>父母把你的狗狗送去安乐死
<1-14,Chandler>and your parents put your dog to sleep,

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,030
<1-14,Chandler>却对你说它跑到别人家农场去住了
<1-14,Chandler>and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,010
<1-15,Ross>真有意思  不是  我是说
<1-15,Ross>That's funny, that, no, because,

22
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,140
<1-15,Ross>我爸妈是真的把我家的狗
<1-15,Ross>uh, our parents actually did, uh,

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,540
<1-15,Ross>送别人农场去养了
<1-15,Ross>send our dog off to live on a farm.

24
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,340
<1-16,Monica>罗斯
<1-16,Monica>Uh, Ross.

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,770
<1-17,Ross>米尔纳家在康乃迪克州的农场
<1-17,Ross>What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut?

26
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,340
<1-17,Ross>米尔纳家
<1-17,Ross>The Millners,

27
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,280
<1-17,Ross>他们家的农场好棒
<1-17,Ross>they had this unbelievable farm,

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,260
<1-17,Ross>有马还有可供追逐的兔子
<1-17,Ross>and horses, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,710
<1-17,Ross>哦  我的天  芝芝
<1-17,Ross>Oh, my God, Chi Chi!

45
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,820
<2-1,Chandler>"知道自己不久于人世有何感受"
<2-1,Chandler>"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,090
<2-2,Joey>"华顿  我的痛苦将在五分钟内消失
<2-2,Joey>"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

47
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,600
<2-2,Joey>而你  要知道
<2-2,Joey>But you'll have to live with the knowledge that

48
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,270
<2-2,Joey>你让一位诚实的人丢掉了性命
<2-2,Joey>you sent an honest man to die."

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,590
<2-3,Chandler>嘿  表演得真好
<2-3,Chandler>Hey, that was really good!

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,550
<2-4,Joey>是吗  谢了  咱们继续吧
<2-4,Joey>Yeah? Thanks! Let's keep going.

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,610
<2-5,Chandler>好  你要我怎么做呢  达蒙
<2-5,Chandler>Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

52
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,720
<2-6,Joey>我只想回到我的牢房内
<2-6,Joey>"I just wanna go back to my cell.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,860
<2-6,Joey>因为在那里  我可以抽烟
<2-6,Joey>'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."

54
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,340
<2-7,Chandler>抽去吧
<2-7,Chandler>"Smoke away."

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,610
<2-8,Chandler>我想这就是达蒙独自在牢房抽烟的原因
<2-8,Chandler>I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.

56
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,130
<2-10,Chandler>-什么  -手放轻松  手腕自然点
<2-10,Chandler>- What? - Relax your hand! Let your wrist go.

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,240
<2-11,Chandler>别太过火
<2-11,Chandler>Not so much!

<2-16,Chandler>算了  不对  把烟给我
<2-16,Chandler>Okay. No. Give it to me.

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,370
<2-17,Joey>你休想  我不会给你烟的
<2-17,Joey>No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,090
<2-18,Chandler>没关系啦
<2-18,Chandler>It's fine, it's fine.

63
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,060
<2-18,Chandler>你到底想不想演这个角色  拿来
<2-18,Chandler>Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,850
<2-18,Chandler>很好  现在
<2-18,Chandler>All right, now.

65
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,830
<2-19,Chandler>别把它当成是支烟
<2-19,Chandler>Don't think of it as a cigarette.

66
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,370
<2-19,Chandler>把它当成是你思念已久的东西
<2-19,Chandler>Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand.

67
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,100
<2-19,Chandler>当你夹着它时  感到自在  感到满足
<2-19,Chandler>When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,280
<2-21,Chandler>-你很想它吗  -没  不怎么想
<2-21,Chandler>- Y'miss it? - Nah, not so much.

00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,480
<3-1,Monica>不对不对  他们说
<3-1,Monica>No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,230
<3-1,Monica>跟从拇指尖到食指尖的距离相等
<3-1,Monica>from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

73
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,330
<3-2,Joey>这太荒谬了
<3-2,Joey>That's ridiculous!

74
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,010
<3-3,Ross>我可以用另一个拇指么
<3-3,Ross>Can I use.. either thumb?

82
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,680
<3-7,Joey>菲比  你没事吧
<3-7,Joey>Y'okay, Phoebe?

83

84
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,000
<3-8,Phoebe>是我存钱的银行
<3-8,Phoebe>It's my bank.

85
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,800
<3-9,Monica>他们对你怎么了
<3-9,Monica>What did they do to you?

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,690
<3-10,Phoebe>也没怎么  只是  好吧
<3-10,Phoebe>It's nothing, it's just- Okay.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,070
<3-10,Phoebe>我当时正在看信  一打开他们的每月
<3-10,Phoebe>I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly,

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,690
<3-10,Phoebe>所谓的  "通知"
<3-10,Phoebe>you know, STATEMENT-

89

<3-11,Ross>别激动  别激动
<3-11,Ross>Easy, easy...

90
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,900
<3-12,Phoebe>发现我户头里多了五百元
<3-12,Phoebe>and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.

91
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,050
<3-13,Chandler>撤旦的爪牙又来祸害人间啦
<3-13,Chandler>Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

92
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,510
<3-14,Phoebe>没错  因为我得到银行找他们解决处理
<3-14,Phoebe>Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
<3-15,Joey>你脑子中风了吗  自己留着呗
<3-15,Joey>What are you talking about? Keep it!

94
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,790
<3-16,Phoebe>这钱不是我的  不是我赚来的
<3-16,Phoebe>It's not mine, I didn't earn it,

95
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,000
<3-16,Phoebe>我留着  就如同偷窃
<3-16,Phoebe>if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,060
<3-17,Rachel>对  可如果你把它花了  就如同购物
<3-17,Rachel>Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!

97
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,180
<3-18,Phoebe>好吧  就比方说我买了一双很棒的鞋
<3-18,Phoebe>Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.

98
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,670
<3-18,Phoebe>你们知道我每踏出一步都会听到什么吗
<3-18,Phoebe>Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took?

99
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,700
<3-18,Phoebe>不是我的
<3-18,Phoebe>'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.'

100
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,980
<3-18,Phoebe>即使我再快乐再雀跃都会听到
<3-18,Phoebe>And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping-I'd hear

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,920
<3-18,Phoebe>不是我的  不是我的  不是我的
<3-18,Phoebe>'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,680
<3-19,Monica>我们知道你的意思了
<3-19,Monica>We're with you. We got it.

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,370
<3-20,Phoebe>很好  我只是  没办法享受这些钱
<3-20,Phoebe>Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it.

104
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,720
<3-20,Phoebe>因为这就像是沉重的因果报应一样
<3-20,Phoebe>It would be like this giant karmic debt.

105
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,160
<3-21,Rachel>钱德勒  你在干什么
<3-21,Rachel>Chandler, what're you doing?

<3-26,Phoebe>我真不敢相信你
<3-26,Phoebe>Oh, I can't believe you!

111
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,530
<3-26,Phoebe>你一直以来都表现良好  都三年了

114
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,060
<3-28,Ross>想想你戒烟后是怎么活过来的
<3-28,Ross>Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.

115
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,960
<3-29,Chandler>所以这一次我不再戒了

00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,290
<3-39,Monica>不  史蒂夫那次之后就别想了
<3-39,Monica>No. Not after what happened with Steve.

129
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,890
<3-40,Chandler>你在说什么  我们都爱史蒂胡
<3-40,Chandler>What are you talking about? We love Schhteve!

130
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,070
<3-40,Chandler>史蒂胡很性感
<3-40,Chandler>Schhteve was schhexy!..

131
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,060
<3-40,Chandler>不好意思
<3-40,Chandler>Sorry.

132
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,720
<3-41,Monica>我自己都还没清楚对他的感觉呢
<3-41,Monica>Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet.

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,310
<3-41,Monica>给我一点时间想清楚
<3-41,Monica>Just give me a chance to figure that out.

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,330
<3-42,Rachel>那么  到时我们就可以见他了吗
<3-42,Rachel>Well, then can we meet him?

135
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,560
<4-1,Monica>凭什么我得让他们见他啊
<4-1,Monica>I mean, why should I let them meet him?

136
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,370
<4-1,Monica>我带个人回家
<4-1,Monica>I mean, I bring a guy home,

137
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,040
<4-1,Monica>五分钟之内他们便会蜂拥而上
<4-1,Monica>and within five minutes they're all over him.

138
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
<4-1,Monica>他们就像丛林狼一样
<4-1,Monica>I mean, they're like- coyotes,

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,600
<4-1,Monica>专挑兽群中的弱者下手
<4-1,Monica>picking off the weak members of the herd.

140
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,780
<4-2,Paula>我说  身为一位阅尽天下极品男的人
<4-2,Paula>Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef,

141
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,660
<4-2,Paula>我告诉你  这事没什么大不了的
<4-2,Paula>I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.

142
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,920
<4-2,Paula>再说了  他们毕竟是你的朋友
<4-2,Paula>Come on now, they're your friends,

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,190
<4-2,Paula>-他们只是关心你  -我知道
<4-2,Paula>- they're just looking out after you. - I know.

144
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,090
<4-3,Monica>我只是希望至少有那么一次
<4-3,Monica>I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home

145
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,820
<4-3,Monica>能带一个他们真正喜欢的男人回家
<4-3,Monica>that they actually liked.

146
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,710
<4-4,Paula>那么你应该很清楚  如果不让他们见面
<4-4,Paula>Well, you do realise that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer

147
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,460
<4-4,Paula>-这种几率就愈发渺茫
<4-4,Paula>- if they never get to meet the guy.

148
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,300
<5-1,Joey>别再想了  罗斯

<6-6,Ross>Alan.He was unbelievable.

213
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,230

<6-6,Ross>He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon

214
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,960
<6-6,Ross>一人包揽所有位置的兔巴哥一样
<6-6,Ross>where Bugs is playing all the positions, right,

215
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,970
<6-6,Ross>只不过取而代之的是
<6-6,Ross>but instead of Bugs it was

226
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,390
<6-12,Rachel>他不可能太过于艾伦
<6-12,Rachel>You can never be too Alan.

227
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,950
<6-13,Ross>没错  我们欣赏的就是那内在的艾伦感
<6-13,Ross>Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.

<7-4,Lizzie>Did you pick out the vowels?

232

<9-1,Ross>I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there,

257
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,860
<9-2,All>像个迷你搭便车的人
<9-2,All>like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

259
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,300
<9-3,Phoebe>没准这是某种竞赛呢
<9-3,Phoebe>Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know?

<9-8,Rachel>这比大拇指更糟糕
<9-8,Rachel>It's worse than the thumb!

264
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,570
<9-9,Chandler>嘿  这很不公平啊
<9-9,Chandler>Hey, this is so unfair!

<9-10,Monica>Oh, why is it unfair?

<9-11,Chandler>So I have a flaw! Big deal?

267
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,320
<9-11,Chandler>乔伊常扳指关节就不惹人厌吗
<9-11,Chandler>Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
<9-11,Chandler>还有罗斯  把每个音发无比清楚
<9-11,Chandler>And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?

269
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,030
<9-11,Chandler>莫妮卡大笑时的鼻音
<9-11,Chandler>And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?

270
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,410
<9-11,Chandler>这算搞什么嘛
<9-11,Chandler>I mean, what the hell is that thing?

271
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,710
<9-11,Chandler>我接受大家所有的缺点
<9-11,Chandler>I accept all those flaws,

272
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,100
<9-11,Chandler>为什么你们就不肯接受我呢
<9-11,Chandler>why can't you accept me for this?

273
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,000
<9-12,Joey>扳指关节真的很惹人厌吗
<9-12,Joey>...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody,

274
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,640
<9-13,Rachel>我觉得有一点点烦
<9-13,Rachel>Well, I-I could live without it.

275
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,260
<9-14,Joey>是只是一点点惹人厌
<9-14,Joey>Well, is it, like, a little annoying,

276
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,030
<9-14,Joey>还是像菲比咬她的头发一样惹人厌
<9-14,Joey>or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

277
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,010
<9-15,Ross>别听他的  菲比
<9-15,Ross>Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right?

278
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,240
<9-15,Ross>我觉得那样很可爱
<9-15,Ross>I think it's endearing.

279
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,250
<9-16,Joey>哦  真的  是吗
<9-16,Joey>Oh, "you do, do you"?

280
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,290
<9-17,Ross>咬字清晰又不犯法
<9-17,Ross>You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

281
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,190
<9-18,Rachel>确实没错
<9-18,Rachel>"Indeed there isn't"...

<9-19,Phoebe>他们真正点的东西了
<9-19,Phoebe>what they actually ordered.

285
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,030
<9-20,Rachel>刚吐出头发  就戴上拳击手套了哈
<9-20,Rachel>The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

<12-14,Phoebe>And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.

341
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,160
<12-14,Phoebe>这世界到底怎么了
<12-14,Phoebe>...What is up with the universe?!

342
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,420
<12-15,Joey>怎么啦
<12-15,Joey>What's going on?

343
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,510
<12-16,Monica>没什么  只是觉得正好大家都在
<12-16,Monica>Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

344
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,650
<12-17,Joey>如果大家都有穿内裤会更好
<12-17,Joey>Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..

345
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,760
<12-18,Rachel>-乔伊  你那里  -天呀
<12-18,Rachel>- Uh, Joey.. - Oh, God!

346

<12-21,All>-好  -哦  是小羊排
<12-21,All>- Okay.. - Oh! That was Lambchop!

347

<12-22,Monica>好了  我们必须得谈谈
<12-22,Monica>Please, guys, we have to talk.

348
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,920
<12-23,Phoebe>等等  我有似曾相识的感觉
<12-23,Phoebe>Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...

349
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,820
<12-23,Phoebe>不  不对
<12-23,Phoebe>No, I'm not.

350
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,460
<12-24,Monica>好吧  我们需要谈谈
<12-24,Monica>Alright, we have to talk.

351
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,990
<12-25,Phoebe>瞧来了
<12-25,Phoebe>There it is!

352
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,660
<12-26,Monica>是有关艾伦的事
<12-26,Monica>Okay. It's-it's about Alan.

353
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,710
<12-26,Monica>有件事应该让你们知道
<12-26,Monica>There's something that you should know.

354
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,260
<12-26,Monica>真的很难启齿
<12-26,Monica>I mean, there's really no easy way to say this..

355
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,440
<12-26,Monica>我决定和艾伦分手
<12-26,Monica>I've decided to break up with Alan.

356
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,320
<12-27,Ross>有第三者
<12-27,Ross>Is there somebody else?

357
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,880
<12-28,Monica>没有没有  只是因为
<12-28,Monica>No, nononono.. it's just..

358
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,410
<12-28,Monica>只是世事难料  人是会变的
<12-28,Monica>y'know, things change. People change.

359
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,370
<12-29,Rachel>我们没变啊
<12-29,Rachel>We didn't change..

360
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,550
<12-30,Joey>这就完了  没戏了吗
<12-30,Joey>So that's it? It's over?

361
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,930
<12-30,Joey>就这么结束了吗
<12-30,Joey>Just like that?

362
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,820
<12-31,Phoebe>当你放下一切防备
<12-31,Phoebe>You know.. you let your guard down,

363
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,090
<12-31,Phoebe>开始真心对待一个人时  我真的
<12-31,Phoebe>you start to really care about someone, and I just- I-

364
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,230
<12-32,Monica>-我可以继续伪装  -好啊
<12-32,Monica>- Look, I- I could go on pretending. - Okay!

365
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,680
<12-33,Joey>不  这样对我不公平
<12-33,Joey>No, but that wouldn't be fair to me,

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,430
<12-34,Monica>对艾伦不公平
<12-34,Monica>it wouldn't be fair to Alan.

367
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,860
<12-34,Monica>对你们大家也不公平
<12-34,Monica>It wouldn't be fair to you!

368
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,970
<12-35,Ross>是吗  谁要公平
<12-35,Ross>Yeah, who wants fair?

<12-35,Ross>I mean, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.

370
