215
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,460
<7-7,Phoebe>充满了一切的未知和可能
<7-7,Phoebe>outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff..

216
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,080
<7-7,Phoebe>他住在一个村庄
<7-7,Phoebe>And he lived in a village,

217
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,540

<7-10,Rachel>But see, it was a plan.

223
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,630
<7-10,Rachel>曾经非常地清楚
<7-10,Rachel>Y'know, it was clear,

224
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,780
<7-10,Rachel>每一步都很有条理
<7-10,Rachel>and everything was figured out.

<7-12,Rachel>So what, you're not the only one.

228
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,620
<7-13,Monica>我们也常不知自己何去何从
<7-13,Monica>I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going.

229
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,040
<7-13,Monica>你得仔细想清楚
<7-13,Monica>You've just gotta figure at some point

230
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
<7-13,Monica>自然就能步上轨道
<7-13,Monica>it's all gonna come together,

231
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,480
<7-13,Monica>这样才能  诸事顺利
<7-13,Monica>and it's just gonna be...un-floopy.

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,680
<7-14,Phoebe>真能拼
<7-14,Phoebe>Oh, like that's a word.

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,090
<7-15,Rachel>好吧莫妮卡  但如果无法步上轨道呢
<7-15,Rachel>Okay, but Monica, what if-what if it doesn't come together?

234
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,390
<7-16,Monica>菲比
<7-16,Monica>...Pheebs?

235
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,060
<7-17,Phoebe>因为你我不喜欢这个问题
<7-17,Phoebe>Oh, well.... 'cause..... you just...I don't like this question.

236
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,600
<7-18,Rachel>瞧如果我们没拿到魔豆吗
<7-18,Rachel>Okay, see, see, you guys,what if we don't get magic beans?
