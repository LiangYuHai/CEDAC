1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,390
<1-1,Monica>别纠结了好吗  这又没什么大不了的
<1-1,Monica>Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,300
<1-1,Monica>没什么大不了  这太神奇了
<1-1,Monica>Not that big a deal? It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,770
<1-2,Ross>你们只不过是用手伸进去鼓捣几下
<1-2,Ross>Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver,

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,750
<1-2,Ross>然后啪一下  文胸就从袖子里抽出来了
<1-2,Ross>and bam, a bra right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,320
<1-2,Ross>好吧  据我所知
<1-2,Ross>All right, as far as I'm concerned,

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,350
<1-2,Ross>男生即使靠的再近也做不到
<1-2,Ross>there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,380
<1-2,Ross>我说得对不对
<1-2,Ross>Am I right?

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,320
<1-3,Rachel>拜托  男生可以站着尿
<1-3,Rachel>Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,630
<1-4,Chandler>我们行吗  我倒要试试看
<1-4,Chandler>We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,080
<1-5,Joey>知道什么最令我嫉妒吗
<1-5,Joey>Ok, you know what blows my mind?

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,760
<1-5,Joey>女人随时都可以看自己的胸部
<1-5,Joey>Women can see breasts any time they want.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,820
<1-5,Joey>只需低头就看到
<1-5,Joey>You just look down and there they are.

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,250
<1-5,Joey>真搞不懂你们怎么会有心工作
<1-5,Joey>How you get any work done is beyond me.

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,610
<1-6,Phoebe>知道我搞不懂什么吗
<1-6,Phoebe>Oh, ok, you know what I don't get?

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,540
<1-6,Phoebe>男人可以做许多下流的事却能毫不在乎
<1-6,Phoebe>The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,050
<1-7,Ross>女人能多重高潮
<1-7,Ross>Multiple orgasms!

32
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,930
<2-1,Chandler>了不起  周末夜

<2-1,Chandler>the big night, date night,

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,820
<2-1,Chandler>周末夜  周末夜
<2-1,Chandler>Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,180
<2-2,Joey>-没计划是吧  -一个都没有
<2-2,Joey>- No plans, huh? - Not a one.

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,600
<2-4,Ross>连和珍妮斯分手的打算都没有
<2-4,Ross>Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,260
<2-5,Chandler>对对对  闭嘴
<2-5,Chandler>Oh, right, right, shut up.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,580
<2-6,Monica>钱德勒  没有人喜欢分手
<2-6,Monica>Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,750
<2-6,Monica>但你还是要做呀
<2-6,Monica>You just gotta do it.

40
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,540
<2-7,Chandler>我知道  但是真的很难  我的意思是
<2-7,Chandler>No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean,

41
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,610
<2-7,Chandler>你坐在她身旁  而她却一无所知
<2-7,Chandler>you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening,

42
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,490
<2-7,Chandler>最后你终于鼓起勇气
<2-7,Chandler>and then you finally get up the courage to do it,

43
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,030
<2-7,Chandler>当你将纸条递给她的那一刻
<2-7,Chandler>and there's the horrible awkward moment

44
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,600
<2-7,Chandler>真的非常尴尬
<2-7,Chandler>when you've handed her the note.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,920
<2-8,Joey>那你干嘛要和她分手
<2-8,Joey>Why do you have to break up with her?

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,970
<2-8,Joey>男人一点  不再打电话就行了
<2-8,Joey>Be a man, just stop calling.

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,680
<2-9,Phoebe>如果你愿意  我和你一起分吧
<2-9,Phoebe>You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,930
<2-10,Chandler>谢了  可我觉得她会以为咱俩演戏蒙她
<2-10,Chandler>Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,800
<2-11,Phoebe>不  我的意思是你和珍妮斯分手
<2-11,Phoebe>No, I mean you break up with Janice

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,180
<2-11,Phoebe>我和托尼分手
<2-11,Phoebe>and I'll break up with Tony.

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,660
<2-13,Monica>-托尼  -你要和托尼分手
<2-13,Monica>- Tony? - Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,160
<2-14,Phoebe>对  我知道  他人很好
<2-14,Phoebe>Yeah, I know, he's sweet,

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,940
<2-14,Phoebe>但我觉得没意思了  明白吗
<2-14,Phoebe>but it's just not fun anymore, you know?

54
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,590
<2-14,Phoebe>我不知道问题是在于我
<2-14,Phoebe>I don't know if it's me,

55
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,280
<2-14,Phoebe>还是他的绝食抗议  我也不知道
<2-14,Phoebe>or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.

56
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,300
<2-15,Rachel>还有人需要什么吗
<2-15,Rachel>Does anybody want anything else?

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,440
<2-16,Ross>对了  上星期你们做的
<2-16,Ross>Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty,

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,310
<2-16,Ross>巧克力坚果派特好吃
<2-16,Ross>chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,800
<2-16,Ross>没事  算了  我不要了
<2-16,Ross>Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

60
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,830
<2-17,Phoebe>怎么啦  一脸不高兴的样子
<2-17,Phoebe>What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?

61
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,230
<2-18,Rachel>是我爸  他要买奔驰敞篷车给我
<2-18,Rachel>It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,550
<2-19,Ross>那人真叫我生气呢
<2-19,Ross>That guy, he burns me up.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,150
<2-20,Rachel>如果我搬回家  就可以得到奔驰
<2-20,Rachel>Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,210
<2-20,Rachel>太可恶了  他称我为"年轻的女士"
<2-20,Rachel>Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.

65
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,480
<2-21,Chandler>我也受不了我爸这样叫我
<2-21,Chandler>Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,380
<2-22,Monica>他是不是又唠叨你不适合在这里之类的话
<2-22,Monica>Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?

67
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,120
<2-23,Rachel>对  而且这次是迪斯科加长版
<2-23,Rachel>Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version,

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,620
<2-23,Rachel>带着三重唱说  "你永远不能自立"
<2-23,Rachel>with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".

69
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,690
<2-25,Angela>嘿  乔伊

71
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,740
<2-27,Monica>被你甩掉显然对她大有好处
<2-27,Monica>Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

72
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,110
<2-28,Phoebe>你想过去吗
<2-28,Phoebe>Are you gonna go over there?

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,030
<2-29,Joey>待会再说  我不想显得太急色
<2-29,Joey>ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.

75
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,790
<2-29,Joey>一只羊  两只羊
<2-29,Joey>One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

76
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,160
<2-29,Joey>三只羊  这样显得比较酷
<2-29,Joey>three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.

77

<2-29,Joey>安吉拉

<2-31,Joey>- Joey. - You look good.

79
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,290
<2-32,Angela>因为我穿了一件很显胸的裙子
<2-32,Angela>That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

80
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,510
<2-33,Joey>看得出来
<2-33,Joey>You don't say.

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,420
<3-3,Ross>想知道有个巧合吗
<3-3,Ross>You uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence?

84
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,660
<3-3,Ross>猜猜谁也要去洗衣店
<3-3,Ross>Guess who's doing laundry there too?

91
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,760
<3-7,Ross>它们显然对烘干纸很感兴趣
<3-7,Ross>Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets,

92
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,080
<3-7,Ross>它们进去时还好  出来是却毛绒绒的

282
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,870

297
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,680
<13-8,Ross>所以白衣全变成粉红色
<13-8,Ross>and now, everything's kinda pink.

298
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,310

<13-11,Rachel>不  它只发生在我身上
<13-11,Rachel>Except it didn't. It happened to me.

303
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,290
<13-11,Rachel>我穿这些看来会像一大团粉红棉花糖
<13-11,Rachel>Oh, God, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep.

304
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,650
<13-11,Rachel>我在做什么  我在做什么啊
<13-11,Rachel>What am I doing? What am I doing?

305
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,050
<13-11,Rachel>我爸说得对  我无法独立生活
<13-11,Rachel>My father's right. I can't live on my own!

306
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,470
<13-11,Rachel>我连洗衣服都不会
<13-11,Rachel>I can't even do laundry!

307
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,110
<14-1,Monica>超能狗的头坏了
<14-1,Monica>Something went wrong with Underdog,

308
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,730
<14-1,Monica>导致充不进去气
<14-1,Monica>and they couldn't get his head to inflate.

309
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:53,340
<14-1,Monica>于是呢  他的头就在百老汇上掉下来了
<14-1,Monica>So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right,

310
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,950
<14-1,Monica>我心想  这实在太不像话了
<14-1,Monica>and I'm just thinking...how inappropriate this is.

311
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,050
<14-1,Monica>有东西跑进我眼睛
<14-1,Monica>Um, I've got something in my eye,

312
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,660
<14-1,Monica>乔伊  能到灯下帮我看看吗
<14-1,Monica>uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

313

<14-3,Joey>-我的天呀  -怎么啦
<14-3,Joey>- Oh my God. - What?

314

<14-4,Monica>喂  我们是坐在同一桌吗
<14-4,Monica>Hello! Were we at the same table?

315
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,170
<14-4,Monica>这真是  太离谱了
<14-4,Monica>It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.

316
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,590
<14-5,Joey>拜托  他们姐弟感情很好
<14-5,Joey>Come on, they're close.

<14-6,Monica>感情很好  她舌头都伸进了他的耳朵
<14-6,Monica>Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

318
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,420
<14-7,Joey>你和罗斯就不会有小动作
<14-7,Joey>Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.

319
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,120
<14-8,Monica>乔伊  这是病态  太恶心了
<14-8,Monica>Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting,

320
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,590
<14-8,Monica>这不是真的  对不
<14-8,Monica>it's, it's? Not really true, is it?

321
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,560
<14-9,Joey>谁说是真的  我是说
<14-9,Joey>Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...

322
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,120
<14-10,Monica>天哪  你到底在想什么
<14-10,Monica>Oh my God, what were you thinking?

323
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,590
<14-11,Joey>好吧  我也不喜欢这样
<14-11,Joey>All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok?

324
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,160
<14-11,Joey>或许有一点
<14-11,Joey>Well, maybe I am a little.

325
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,200
<14-14,Monica>我要走了

330
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,800
<14-17,Joey>就能让他们劳燕分飞
<14-17,Joey>between the two of us, we can break them up.

331
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,310
<14-18,Monica>真是抱歉  没想到我会这样
<14-18,Monica>I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this,
