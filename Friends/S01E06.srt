<4-20,Chandler>what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having

125
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,950
<4-20,Chandler>既然你已有丈夫和男友
<4-20,Chandler>if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,870
<4-21,Aurora>大概是炮友关系吧
<4-21,Aurora>I suppose mainly sexual.

127
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,160
<4-23,Monica>真是遗憾你们吹了
<4-23,Monica>Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,360
<4-24,Chandler>什么吹了  周四我还要和她约会
<4-24,Chandler>What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,980
<4-24,Chandler>难道你没听懂
<4-24,Chandler>Didn't you listen to the story?

130
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,330
<4-25,Monica>难道你没听懂  这太离谱了
<4-25,Monica>Didn't you listen to the story? This is twisted!

131
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,570
<4-25,Monica>你怎能和这种女人交往
<4-25,Monica>How could you get involved with a woman like this?

132
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,130
<4-26,Chandler>开始我也无法接受
<4-26,Chandler>Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too,

133
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,090
<4-26,Chandler>但后来我想
<4-26,Chandler>but the way I look at it is,

134
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,080
<4-26,Chandler>这事我完全不吃亏啊
<4-26,Chandler>I get all the good stuff all the fun,

135
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,470
<4-26,Chandler>可以甜言蜜语  男欢女爱
<4-26,Chandler>all the talking, all the sex,

136
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,000
<4-26,Chandler>不用负任何责任
<4-26,Chandler>and none of the responsibility.

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,280
<4-26,Chandler>这是每个男人的梦想
<4-26,Chandler>I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!

138
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,610
<4-27,Phoebe>是吗  未必吧
<4-27,Phoebe>Oh, yeah. That is not true.

139
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,090
<4-27,Phoebe>罗斯  这是你的梦想吗
<4-27,Phoebe>Ross, is this your fantasy?

140
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,020
<4-28,Ross>当然不可能
<4-28,Ross>No, of course not!

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,950
<4-28,Ross>好吧  是
<4-28,Ross>Yeah, yeah, it is.

142
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,260
<4-29,Monica>你们男生不介意和
<4-29,Monica>So you guys don't mind going out with someone else

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,310
<4-29,Monica>已有对象的女人交往吗
<4-29,Monica>who's going out with someone else?

144
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,950
<4-30,Joey>我办不到
<4-30,Joey>I couldn't do it.

145
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,100
<4-31,Monica>干得好  乔伊
<4-31,Monica>Good for you, Joey.

146
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,350
<4-32,Joey>和女人交往时  我必须确定
<4-32,Joey>When I'm with a woman, I need to know that

147
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,940
<4-32,Joey>我交往的对象比她多
<4-32,Joey>I'm going out with more people than she is.

148
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,290
<4-33,Ross>一夫一妻  值得商榷
<4-33,Ross>Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept.

149
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,570
<4-33,Ross>就人类学的观点而言
<4-33,Ross>I mean, anthropologically speaking-

150
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,990
<4-34,Ross>行  这是你们的损失
<4-34,Ross>Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,090
<4-35,Monica>逗你的
<4-35,Monica>We're kidding.

152
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,580
<4-35,Monica>快说  我们想知道
<4-35,Monica>Come on, tell us!

153
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,540
<4-37,Ross>好吧  理查德·里奇提出这样的理论
<4-37,Ross>Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-

154
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,640
<5-2,Chandler>现在都这样打招呼吗  我喜欢
<5-2,Chandler>Are we greeting each other this way now? Cause I like that.

155
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,380
<5-3,Rachel>瞧  我大扫除了

<5-3,Rachel>我擦窗户拖地板
<5-3,Rachel>I did the windows, I did the floors...

157
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,580
<5-3,Rachel>我甚至还用了吸尘器上的所有装置
<5-3,Rachel>I even used all the attachments on the vacuum,

158
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,820
<5-3,Rachel>除了圆形有鬃毛那个之外
<5-3,Rachel>except that little round one with the bristles,

159
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,950
<5-3,Rachel>因为我不知道用途为何
<5-3,Rachel>I don't know what that's for.

160
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,740
<5-4,Ross>没人知道  我们也不该问
<5-4,Ross>Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.

161
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,770
<5-5,Rachel>你们感觉怎样
<5-5,Rachel>Well, what think?

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,190
<5-7,Monica>看来你把绿色软椅也挪动了
<5-7,Monica>...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.

164
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,460
<5-9,Monica>你怎么想这样做呢
<5-9,Monica>How-how did that happen?

165
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,230
<5-10,Rachel>我不知道  我觉得摆那儿会更好看
<5-10,Rachel>I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there.

166
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,680
<5-10,Rachel>而且这样  咖啡桌旁就多了一个座位
<5-10,Rachel>And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.

167
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,460
<5-11,Monica>是啊  这倒有意思
<5-11,Monica>Yeah, yeah, it's interesting..

168
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,280
<5-11,Monica>这样好了  只是为了好玩

<5-11,Monica>我们看它在原来位置的感觉如何
<5-11,Monica>let's see what it looked like in the old spot.

170
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,850
<5-11,Monica>只是做个比较
<5-11,Monica>Alright, just to compare.

171

<5-11,Monica>就摆那儿一阵子吧
<5-11,Monica>Let's just leave it there for a while.

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,030
<5-12,Phoebe>我无法相信你竟敢搬动那个绿软椅
<5-12,Phoebe>I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.

174
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,290
<5-13,Chandler>幸好你没摊开摆杂志
<5-13,Chandler>Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines.

175
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,670
<5-13,Chandler>否则她铁定会挖出你的眼睛
<5-13,Chandler>I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.

176
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,760

<5-16,Monica>这太不公平了
<5-16,Monica>That is so unfair!

181
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,470
<5-17,Ross>拜托  我们小时候时
<5-17,Ross>Oh come on! When we were kids,

<5-18,Monica>But hey, I can be a kook.

185
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,850
<5-19,Ross>好吧  懒女人  想像这个情况
<5-19,Ross>Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this.

186
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,650
<5-19,Ross>电话账单来了  但你不能立刻去交钱
<5-19,Ross>The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.

187
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,860
<5-20,Monica>-为什么  -因为你是个大懒人
<5-20,Monica>- Why not? - Because you're a kook!

188
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,610
<5-21,Ross>直拖到他们寄催缴通知单来
<5-21,Ross>Instead you wait until they send you a notice.

189
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,170
<5-22,Monica>我可以办到
<5-22,Monica>I could do that.

<5-23,Rachel>但是很难倒出来的那种
<5-23,Rachel>but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,130
<5-24,Monica>为什么有人会那样做
<5-24,Monica>Why would someone do that?! ...

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
<5-24,Monica>有人会想
<5-24,Monica>One might wonder.

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,490
<5-25,Chandler>冷气凝结的小水珠
<5-25,Chandler>Little beads of condensation are inching their way

199
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,610
<5-25,Chandler>逐渐逼近桌面
<5-25,Chandler>closer and closer to the surface of the wood...

315
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,730
<8-28,Aurora>我们为何不能及时行乐
<8-28,Aurora>Why can't we just have what we have now?

316
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,450
<8-28,Aurora>为何不能只是谈谈  笑笑  再做爱呢
<8-28,Aurora>Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love,

317
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,120
<8-28,Aurora>彼此没有任何负担
<8-28,Aurora>without feeling obligated to one another...

318
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,280
<8-28,Aurora>今晚之前  我以为这也是你想要的
<8-28,Aurora>and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.

319
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,980
<8-29,Chandler>部分的我想要
<8-29,Chandler>...Well, y'know, part of me wants that,

320
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,190
<8-29,Chandler>但我就像是双面人
<8-29,Chandler>but it's like I'm two guys, you know?

321
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,420
<8-29,Chandler>一个说"闭嘴  及时行乐"
<8-29,Chandler>I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!'

322
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,890
<8-29,Chandler>还有另一个
<8-29,Chandler>But there's this other guy.

323
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,860
<8-29,Chandler>他每回都会浮现出来
<8-29,Chandler>Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time

324
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,490
<8-29,Chandler>就好像圣诞怪杰的心扩大三倍
<8-29,Chandler>that Grinch's heart grows three sizes

325
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,840
<8-29,Chandler>砸掉测量计那样
<8-29,Chandler>and breaks that measuring device...

326
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,680
<8-29,Chandler>他会一直说
<8-29,Chandler>And he's saying, y'know,

327
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,010
<8-29,Chandler>"这太纠结了  停下  停下"
<8-29,Chandler>'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'

328
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,420
<8-30,Aurora>那么  你准备听从谁的话呢
<8-30,Aurora>So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?

329
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
<8-31,Chandler>我不知道  两人的话我得都听
<8-31,Chandler>I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them,

330
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,810
<8-31,Chandler>他们争执不休互不相让
<8-31,Chandler>they don't exactly let each other finish...

331
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,840
<8-32,Aurora>哪一个
<8-32,Aurora>Which one?

332
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,740
<8-33,Chandler>第二个
<8-33,Chandler>...The second guy.

333

<8-34,Aurora>好吧  如果你改主意了再打电话给我吧
<8-34,Aurora>Well, call me if you change your mind.

334
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,850
<8-35,Chandler>抱歉  第一个人控制了嘴巴
<8-35,Chandler>Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

335
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,180
<9-1,Ross>这样想吧  是你甩的她
<9-1,Ross>Look at it this way : you dumped her. Right?

336
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,190
<9-1,Ross>你看  这个女人无与伦比的性感
<9-1,Ross>I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy,

337
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,600
<9-1,Ross>倾国倾城  冰雪聪明  遥不可及
<9-1,Ross>and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...

338
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,650
<9-1,Ross>再告诉我一次  你为何这么做
<9-1,Ross>Tell me why you did this again?

339

<9-3,Monica>在阿尔·帕西诺新片中演屁股的那个人吗
<9-3,Monica>plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

341

<9-6,Chandler>"Big guy?"

344
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,760
<9-7,Ross>感觉就像"大个儿"时刻
<9-7,Ross>It felt like a 'big guy'moment.

345
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,080
<9-8,Joey>我被开除了
<9-8,Joey>I got fired.

346
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,580
<9-9,All>没错他们说我表演太用力了
<9-9,All>Yeah, they said I acted too much with it.

347
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,470
<9-10,Joey>我之前可是满世界宣扬
<9-10,Joey>I told everybody about this!

348
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,740
<9-10,Joey>现在大家都想去电影院
<9-10,Joey>Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre,

<9-10,Joey>期待能看到我露面
<9-10,Joey>expecting to see me, and...

350
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,710
<9-11,Rachel>乔伊  没人会认出来的
<9-11,Rachel>Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.

351
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,560
<9-12,Joey>我妈就认得出来
<9-12,Joey>My mom will.

352
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,500
<9-13,Chandler>这感觉真温馨  又有点呕心
<9-13,Chandler>Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.

353
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,260
<9-14,Joey>六年来我除了演些烂角色一事无成
<9-14,Joey>Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years.

354
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,440
<9-14,Joey>如今机会来了  我竟将它搞砸
<9-14,Joey>And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!

355
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,370
<9-15,Monica>或许这不是你的机会
<9-15,Monica>Maybe this wasn't your shot.

356
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:49,250
<9-16,Ross>我的意思是
<9-16,Ross>Yeah, I mean...

357
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,420
<9-16,Ross>机会是否来临  自己最清楚
<9-16,Ross>I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot.

358
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,910
<9-16,Ross>你感觉这是你的机会吗
<9-16,Ross>Did it... feel like your shot..?

359
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,010
<9-17,Joey>很难分辨  我当时全身赤裸
<9-17,Joey>Hard to tell, I was naked.

360
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,090
<9-18,Phoebe>我不认为这是你唯一的机会
<9-18,Phoebe>No, I don't think this was your shot.

361
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,430
<9-18,Phoebe>你的机会不会只有一个
<9-18,Phoebe>I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot.

362
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,670
<9-18,Phoebe>我相信大好机会就降临到你身上
<9-18,Phoebe>I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do!

363
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,570
<9-18,Phoebe>你只要一直想着
<9-18,Phoebe>You've gotta just keep thinking about

364
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,300
<9-18,Phoebe>将来有个小伙子跑到朋友面前说
<9-18,Phoebe>the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go

365
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,010
<9-18,Phoebe>我被选上了  我被选上了
<9-18,Phoebe>'I got the part! I got the part!

366
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,630

<9-18,Phoebe>I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.

367

<9-19,Joey>真的吗  你真好
<9-19,Joey>Yeah? That's so nice!

368

<9-20,Monica>真遗憾  乔伊
<9-20,Monica>I'm sorry, Joey.

369

<9-21,All>晚安
<9-21,All>Good night

371
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,420
<9-22,Rachel>莫妮卡  你要把鞋子留在这儿吗
<9-22,Rachel>Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?

372
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,570
<9-23,Monica>真的吗
<9-23,Monica>Really?

373
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,220
<9-24,Rachel>就这样随随便便地乱丢吗
<9-24,Rachel>Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?

374
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,760
<9-25,Monica>无所谓
<9-25,Monica>Doesn't matter,

375
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,220
<9-25,Monica>我明天再拿  或者算了
<9-25,Monica>I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not.

376
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,700
<9-25,Monica>随便
<9-25,Monica>Whenever.

377
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,820
<9-26,Ross>她真懒散
<9-26,Ross>She is a kook.

378
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,430
<10-1,Monica>既然这么困扰  就快去拿吧
<10-1,Monica>If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.

379
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,570
<10-1,Monica>不  千万别去  太愚蠢了
<10-1,Monica>No. Don't do this. This is stupid!

380
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,670
<10-1,Monica>我无须证明什么  我要去拿
<10-1,Monica>I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...

381
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,420
<10-1,Monica>但如此一来他们都会知道
<10-1,Monica>But then everyone will know.

382
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,750
<10-1,Monica>除非我去拿  然后早起放回去
<10-1,Monica>Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back!

383
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,230
<10-1,Monica>谁来帮我一把
