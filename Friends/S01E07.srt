<9-26,Rachel>你有没有觉得有一种人会一辈子
<9-26,Rachel>I mean, do you think there are people

120
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,810
<9-26,Rachel>都庸庸碌碌从未拥有过某种
<9-26,Rachel>who go through life never having that kind of...

121
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,260
<9-27,Ross>也许吧

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,130
<9-27,Ross>但是我得告诉你
<9-27,Ross>But you know, I'll tell you something.

<9-27,Ross>-我们高估了恋爱中的激情  -是吗
<9-27,Ross>- Passion is way overrated. - Yeah right.

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,030
<9-29,Ross>真的  激情最终会消退
<9-29,Ross>It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out.

125
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:50,040
<9-29,Ross>但双方仍保有信赖  安全感和
<9-29,Ross>But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and...

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,660
<9-29,Ross>以我前妻为例  女同志主义
<9-29,Ross>well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism.

00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,930
<9-29,Ross>因此  那些缺乏激情之人
<9-29,Ross>So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on

128
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,020
<9-29,Ross>还有其他可取之处
<9-29,Ross>that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.

129
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,420
<9-31,Ross>-明白  -但我想你不是那种人
<9-31,Ross>- OK. - But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.

130
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,510
<9-32,Rachel>你也觉得不是
<9-32,Rachel>You don't.

131
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:16,040
<9-33,Ross>我觉得  你的未来将充满激情
<9-33,Ross>Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.

132
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,550
<9-35,Ross>-真的吗  -嗯
<9-35,Ross>- Really? - Mmmm.

<9-36,Rachel>-真的吗  -真的
<9-36,Rachel>-You do? - I do.

134
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,300
<9-38,Rachel>罗斯  你真是太了不起了
<9-38,Rachel>Oh Ross, you're so great.

135
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,500
<9-39,Joey>你别妄想了
<9-39,Joey>It's never gonna happen.

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,590
<9-40,Ross>什么

<9-41,Joey>You and Rachel.

138
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,260

<9-42,Ross>Why not?

139
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,550
<9-43,Joey>因为你拖拖拉拉迟迟不肯行动
<9-43,Joey>Because you waited too long to make your move,

140
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,810
<9-43,Joey>现在只能待在"朋友区"
<9-43,Joey>and now you're in the friend zone.

141
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,780
<9-44,Ross>不不不  我没在朋友区
<9-44,Ross>No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.

142
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,250
<9-45,Joey>罗斯  你是朋友区主席
<9-45,Joey>Ross, you're mayor of the zone.

143
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,150
<9-46,Ross>我这是慢慢来  行吗
<9-46,Ross>I'm taking my time, alright?

144
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,450
<9-46,Ross>我正在为以后铺路
<9-46,Ross>I'm laying the groundwork.

145
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,470
<9-46,Ross>每一天  我都会更接近
<9-46,Ross>Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...

146
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,940
<9-47,Joey>变成神父
<9-47,Joey>Priesthood!

147
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,730
<9-47,Joey>罗斯  她根本不知道你在想什么
<9-47,Joey>Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.

148
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,400
<9-47,Joey>如果再不快点约她出去
<9-47,Joey>If you don't ask her out soon

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,790
<9-47,Joey>你将困在朋友区  永世不得翻身
<9-47,Joey>you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.

150
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,080
<9-48,Ross>我会的  我只是在等恰当的时机
<9-48,Ross>I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.

<9-49,Joey>What's messing you up?

154
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,770
<9-49,Joey>美酒  烛光  月光
<9-49,Joey>The wine? The candles? The moonlight?

155
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,510
<9-49,Joey>你只需走到她面前说
<9-49,Joey>You've just got to go up to her and say,

156
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,550
<9-49,Joey>瑞秋  我想
<9-49,Joey>'Rachel, I think that...'

157
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,650
<9-51,Rachel>你在嘘什么
<9-51,Rachel>What are you shushing?

158
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,330
<9-52,Ross>我们嘘  是因为我们正在听
<9-52,Ross>We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something.

159
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,660
<9-52,Ross>听什么
<9-52,Ross>What?

160

<10-4,Chandler>What the hell was that?

167
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,320
<10-4,Chandler>切记  吉尔·古达克请你吃口香糖你就吃
<10-4,Chandler>Mental note : If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.

168
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,350
<10-4,Chandler>她叫你吃动物死尸  你也得吃
<10-4,Chandler>If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.

169
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,090
<10-4,Chandler>*纽约大停电*

<11-1,Phoebe>*But to me it is not scary,*

172
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,260

<11-13,Monica>Why not?

181
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,010
<11-14,Joey>因为有理由
<11-14,Joey>Because of... the reason.

182
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,950
<11-15,Monica>什么理由
<11-15,Monica>And that would be?

<11-20,Joey>他正在准备你的生日派对
<11-20,Joey>He's planning your birthday party.

<11-22,Joey>You'd better act surprised.-

<11-24,Monica>-装什么  -我的生日派对
<11-24,Monica>- About what? - My surprise party!

<11-25,Phoebe>- What surprise party? - Oh stop it.

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,210
<11-26,Monica>乔伊已经告诉我了
<11-26,Monica>Joey already told me.

194
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,720
<11-27,Phoebe>他没有告诉我
<11-27,Phoebe>Well, he didn't tell me.

195
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,700
<11-28,Joey>别看我  这是罗斯的主意
<11-28,Joey>Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.

196
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,480
<11-29,Phoebe>每次都这样
<11-29,Phoebe>This is so typical.

197
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,370
<11-29,Phoebe>我总是最后知道的人
<11-29,Phoebe>I'm always the last one to know everything.

198
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,630
<11-30,Monica>你不是  我们都有告诉你
<11-30,Monica>No, you are not. We tell you stuff.

199
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,700
<11-31,Phoebe>才怪  钱德勒在动物园被孔雀咬
<11-31,Phoebe>Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know

200
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
<11-31,Phoebe>我是最后知道的人
<11-31,Phoebe>when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.

201
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,790
<11-31,Phoebe>乔伊刚搬来时你对他有意思
<11-31,Phoebe>I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey

202
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,010
<11-31,Phoebe>我也是最后知道
<11-31,Phoebe>when he was moving in.

203
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,390
<11-31,Phoebe>什么
<11-31,Phoebe>What?

204
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,640
<11-31,Phoebe>看来我是倒数第二知道的
<11-31,Phoebe>Looks like I was second to last.

205
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,390
<12-1,Rachel>感觉好好
<12-1,Rachel>Hmmm... this is so nice.

206
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,780
<12-2,Ross>我有个问题
<12-2,Ross>OK, I have a question. .

207
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,660
<12-2,Ross>实际上  也谈不上是问题
<12-2,Ross>Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..

208
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,340
<12-2,Ross>更类似于好奇心
<12-2,Ross>more of a general wondering... ment

209
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,970
<12-3,Rachel>是这样的
<12-3,Rachel>OK. Here goes.

210
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,740
<12-4,Ross>这些日子以来我一直想
<12-4,Ross>For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....

211
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,580
<12-6,Ross>对  没错
<12-6,Ross>Yes, yes, that's right...

212
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,890
<12-7,Rachel>瞧那只小猫  -什么
<12-7,Rachel>- Oh, look at the little cat!  - What? Ow!

213
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,380
<12-7,Rachel>*我站在世界之巅*
<12-7,Rachel>*I'm on top of the world,*

215
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:11,760
<12-7,Rachel>*俯瞰芸芸丛生  却只找到一种解释*
<12-7,Rachel>*looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find,*

216
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,430
<13-1,Monica>消炎喷雾而已  不会痛的
<13-1,Monica>This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.

218
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,810
<13-2,Joey>对不起  那是蜡油
<13-2,Joey>Sorry, that was wax.

219
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,650
<13-3,Phoebe>可怜的小猫快吓死了
<13-3,Phoebe>Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death.

220
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,570
<13-3,Phoebe>我们得找到它的主人
<13-3,Phoebe>We should find his owner.

221
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,650
<13-4,Ross>我们干吗不直接将它放在走廊里
<13-4,Ross>Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?

222
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,090
<13-5,Rachel>正在大停电  它会被踩死的
<13-5,Rachel>During a blackout? He'd get trampled!-

223
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,480
<13-6,Ross>是吗
<13-6,Ross>Yeah?

224
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,900
<14-1,Chandler>考虑之后  口香糖是绝佳的选择
<14-1,Chandler>You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.

225
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,340
<14-1,Chandler>口香糖是绝佳的选择
<14-1,Chandler>'Gum would be perfection'?,'

226
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,430
<14-1,Chandler>口香糖是绝佳的选择
<14-1,Chandler>'Gum would be perfection.'

227
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,760
<14-1,Chandler>我大可说"口香糖也不错"
<14-1,Chandler>Could have said 'gum would be nice,'

228
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,950
<14-1,Chandler>或是"我也来一片"
<14-1,Chandler>or 'I'll have a stick"

229
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,320
<14-1,Chandler>不行不行
<14-1,Chandler>but no, no, no, no.

230
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,060
<14-1,Chandler>"口香糖是绝佳的选择"就可以了
<14-1,Chandler>For me, gum is perfection.

231
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,950
<14-1,Chandler>我真鄙视我自己
<14-1,Chandler>I loathe myself.

232
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,380
<14-1,Chandler>不  孟德斯家讨厌一切活物
<14-1,Chandler>Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things,

233
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,760
<15-1,Phoebe>你好  我们刚捡到这只猫
<15-1,Phoebe>Hi. We just found this cat

234
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,690
<15-2,Rachel>现在正在找它的主人
<15-2,Rachel>and we're looking for the owner.

235
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,900
<15-3,Mr. Heckles>对  猫是我的
<15-3,Mr. Heckles>Er, yeah, it's mine.

236
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,020
<15-4,Phoebe>可是它似乎很讨厌你

264
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,780
<17-17,Phoebe>我找遍了整栋公寓
<17-17,Phoebe>Alright. I looked all over the building

265
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,650
