<1-3,Shelley>我遇见一个和你是绝配的人
<1-3,Shelley>because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,730
<1-4,Chandler>绝配或许是个问题
<1-4,Chandler>Ah, you see, perfect might be a problem.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,200
<1-4,Chandler>你若说共同独立  或自我毁灭的话
<1-4,Chandler>Had you said 'co- dependent', or 'self- destructive'...

<2-1,Chandler>I mean, is that ridiculous?

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,090
<2-1,Chandler>你能相信她竟然有这种想法吗
<2-1,Chandler>Can you believe she actually thought that?

36
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,260
<2-2,Rachel>能啊  好吧

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,350
<2-4,Rachel>一直盯着我的胸部  我想你大概不是吧
<2-4,Rachel>talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,880
<2-5,Chandler>那么
<2-5,Chandler>Huh. Did, uh...

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,730
<6-1,Chandler>好吧  是因为我的头发吗
<6-1,Chandler>okay. Is it my hair?

117
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,190
<6-2,Rachel>对  钱德勒  就是因为你的头发
<6-2,Rachel>Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.

118
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,550
<6-3,Phoebe>你有一头同性恋一样的头发
<6-3,Phoebe>Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

<6-9,Ross>我知道她已过世  但我感觉
<6-9,Ross>I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...

126
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,010
<6-10,Phoebe>或许是因为她还没有真的走
<6-10,Phoebe>Maybe that's because she's not really gone.

127
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,640
<6-11,Ross>不  她已经走了
<6-11,Ross>Nono, she's gone.

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,820
<6-12,Monica>好多遍
<6-12,Monica>A lot.

130
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,790
<6-13,Phoebe>也许人们并不会真正离开
<6-13,Phoebe>Hm, I mean maybe no- one ever really goes.

131
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,960
<6-13,Phoebe>自从我妈妈去世后  不管是过去还是现在
<6-13,Phoebe>Ever since my mom died, every now and then,

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,000
<6-13,Phoebe>我都感觉她好像就在我附近
<6-13,Phoebe>I get the feeling that she's like right here, you know?

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,510
<6-13,Phoebe>还有黛比  我中学时最好的朋友
<6-13,Phoebe>Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high-

134
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,490
<6-13,Phoebe>打迷你高尔夫的时候被闪电击中了
<6-13,Phoebe>got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course-

135
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,720
<6-13,Phoebe>每当我用那个黄色的小铅笔的时候
<6-13,Phoebe>I always get this really strong Debbie vibe

136
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,250
<6-13,Phoebe>我就会有一种很强烈的感觉
<6-13,Phoebe>whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, you know?

137
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,010
<6-13,Phoebe>我好想念她
<6-13,Phoebe>I miss her.

138
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,050
<6-14,Rachel>菲比  你要吗
<6-14,Rachel>Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?

139
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,860
<6-15,Phoebe>谢谢
<6-15,Phoebe>Thanks!

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,460
<6-16,Rachel>不客气  早上刚削好的
<6-16,Rachel>Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.

141
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,650
<6-17,Joey>其实啊  这些我一点都不信
<6-17,Joey>Now, see, I don't believe any of that.

142
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,890
<6-17,Joey>我觉得一个人一旦死了  那就是死了
<6-17,Joey>I think once you're dead, you're dead!

143
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,390
<6-17,Joey>消失了  成了昆虫的食物
<6-17,Joey>You're gone! You're worm food!

144
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,100
<6-17,Joey>钱德勒像同性恋哈
<6-17,Joey>...So Chandler looks gay, huh?

145
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,160
<6-18,Phoebe>跟你说啊  我不知道这是谁
<6-18,Phoebe>You know, I don't who this is,

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,850
<6-18,Phoebe>但这绝对不是黛比
<6-18,Phoebe>but it's not Debbie.

147
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,530
<7-1,Ross>我以为要用密封的棺木
<7-1,Ross>I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.

148
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,610
<7-2,Mrs. Geller>这并不代表她不能看起来体面一点
<7-2,Mrs. Geller>Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!

149
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,100
<7-3,Mrs. Geller>宝贝  你觉得你能进到里面去吗
<7-3,Mrs. Geller>Sweetie, you think you can get in there?

150
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,210
<7-4,Ross>我想应该不会进不去吧
<7-4,Ross>I don't see why not.

151
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,460
<7-5,Ross>我的牙箍在这里
<7-5,Ross>Here's my retainer!

152
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,160

<7-5,Ross>听我说
<7-5,Ross>Listen to me!

154
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,210
<8-1,Mr. Geller>我走的时候
<8-1,Mr. Geller>When my time comes,

155
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,510
<8-3,Mr. Geller>我想要海葬
<8-3,Mr. Geller>I wanna be buried at sea.

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,040
<8-5,Mr. Geller>我要海葬
<8-5,Mr. Geller>I wanna be buried at sea,

158
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,790
<8-5,Mr. Geller>那一定很好玩
<8-5,Mr. Geller>it looks like fun.

159
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,390
<8-6,Monica>好玩是什么意思
<8-6,Monica>Define fun.

160
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,460
<8-7,Mr. Geller>那一天你们会玩得很开心的
<8-7,Mr. Geller>Come on, you'll make a day of it!

161
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,890
<8-7,Mr. Geller>你们可以租一条船  带着午餐
<8-7,Mr. Geller>You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...

162
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,990
<8-8,Monica>然后把你的尸体丢入大海
<8-8,Monica>...And then we throw your body in the water...

163
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,300
<8-8,Monica>好像是有点好玩
<8-8,Monica>Gee, that does sound fun.

164
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,170
<8-9,Mr. Geller>每个人都自认为了解我
<8-9,Mr. Geller>Everyone thinks they know me.

165
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,440
<8-9,Mr. Geller>他们都说杰克·盖勒  跟我想的一样
<8-9,Mr. Geller>Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'.

166
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,620
<8-9,Mr. Geller>或许我像那样离世
<8-9,Mr. Geller>Maybe after I'm gone,

167
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,400
<8-9,Mr. Geller>他们会说  海葬  哎哟
<8-9,Mr. Geller>they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.

168
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,190
<8-10,Monica>他们大概会这么说吧
<8-10,Monica>That's probably what they'll say.

169
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,770
<8-11,Mr. Geller>希望如此
<8-11,Mr. Geller>I'd like that.

170
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,820
<9-1,Chandler>美女

<9-3,Chandler>No, nono, don't-  don't worry about it.

173
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,660
<9-3,Chandler>相信我  显然别人也犯了相同的错误
<9-3,Chandler>Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.

174
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,130
<9-4,Shelley>好的  唉
<9-4,Shelley>Oh! Okay! Phew!

175
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,700
<9-5,Chandler>那么  你为什么会觉得我是那样
<9-5,Chandler>So, uh... what do you think it is about me?

178
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,660
<9-8,Shelley>真可惜  因为你和罗尔本来很登对
<9-8,Shelley>You know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would have made a great couple.

179
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,850
<9-9,Chandler>罗尔  会计部的罗尔
<9-9,Chandler>Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell,

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,180
<9-9,Chandler>你觉得我们很配
<9-9,Chandler>that's who you saw me with?

181
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,460
<9-10,Shelley>怎么了  他很帅啊
<9-10,Shelley>What? He's cute!

182
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,370
<9-11,Chandler>怎么不是负责发薪水的那个布莱恩啊
<9-11,Chandler>yeah... not Brian in Payroll.

183
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,390
<9-12,Shelley>难道你和布莱恩
<9-12,Shelley>Is Brian...?

185
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,280
<9-13,Chandler>重点是  如果你想替我和某人牵线
<9-13,Chandler>The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone,

186
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,840
<9-13,Chandler>我不想你给我找像他那样的人
<9-13,Chandler>I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.

187
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,710
<9-14,Shelley>我觉得你有点配不上布莱恩
<9-14,Shelley>Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.

188
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,570
<9-15,Chandler>什么
<9-15,Chandler>Excuse me?

<9-15,Chandler>You don't think I could get a Brian?

190
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,130
<9-15,Chandler>其实我可以的
<9-15,Chandler>Because I could get a Brian.

191
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,140
<9-15,Chandler>相信我
<9-15,Chandler>Believe you me. ...

197
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,140
<10-3,Ross>柠檬黄套装过下辈子  还是选紫红色吧
<10-3,Ross>spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant- suit, go with the burgundy.

198
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,070
<10-4,Aunt Lillian>不管咱们选什么
<10-4,Aunt Lillian>You know, whatever we pick,

199
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,480
<10-4,Aunt Lillian>她都会告诉咱们选错了
<10-4,Aunt Lillian>she would've told us it's the wrong one.

200
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,920
<10-5,Mrs. Geller>你说得没错  就选紫红色吧
<10-5,Mrs. Geller>You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.

<10-9,Mrs. Geller>那是日装鞋子
<10-9,Mrs. Geller>That's really a day shoe.

206
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,950
<10-10,Ross>难道她要去的地方  别人穿戴都很讲究吗
<10-10,Ross>And where she's going everyone else will be dressier?

207
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,300
<10-11,Aunt Lillian>能找鞋跟细一点的鞋吗
<10-11,Aunt Lillian>Could we see something in a slimmer heel?

211
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,960
<10-14,Mrs. Geller>除非咱们选其他衣服
<10-14,Mrs. Geller>Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?

<11-2,Monica>你知道我的耳朵并最好看的地方吗
<11-2,Monica>Did you know my ears are not my best feature?

220
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,550
<11-3,Ross>有时候我也这样想
<11-3,Ross>Some days it's all I can think about.

<11-10,Ross>难道咱们这里没有鞋子卖么
<11-10,Ross>What, we- uh-  we don't have shoes here, or...?

<16-15,Mrs. Geller>告诉她什么
<16-15,Mrs. Geller>Tell her what?

313
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,190

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,130
<16-16,Monica>挑剔每一件事
<16-16,Monica>picking on every little detail

315
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,620
<16-16,Monica>例如  你的头发
<16-16,Monica>like your hair... for example.

316
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,620
<16-17,Mrs. Geller>我不懂你在说什么

<16-18,Monica>Do you think things would have been better

318
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,130
<16-18,Monica>事情会有所好转吗
<16-18,Monica>if you'd just told her the truth?
