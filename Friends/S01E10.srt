<4-14,Chandler>I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.

126
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,960
<4-15,Monica>可是珍妮丝
<4-15,Monica>Yeah, but Janice?

127
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,120
<4-15,Monica>你们分手时不是闹得特别糟糕吗
<4-15,Monica>That-that was like the worst breakup in history!

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,000
<4-16,Chandler>我没说这是个好主意
<4-16,Chandler>I'm not saying it was a good idea,

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
<4-16,Chandler>我只是说我反悔了
<4-16,Chandler>I'm saying I snapped.

130
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,790
<4-17,Joey>抱歉  我迟到了
<4-17,Joey>Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

131
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,190
<4-18,Chandler>太滑稽了
<4-18,Chandler>Too many jokes...

132
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,840
<4-18,Chandler>快嘲笑乔伊
<4-18,Chandler>must mock Joey!

133
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,350
<4-19,Joey>鞋子正点吧
<4-19,Joey>Nice shoes, huh?

134
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,580
<4-20,Chandler>我快笑死了
<4-20,Chandler>God, you're killing me!

135
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,480
<4-21,Monica>罗斯  他又玩我的铲子
<4-21,Monica>Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!

136
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,730
<4-22,Ross>没事  他又不会把它们弄疼
<4-22,Ross>Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

137
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,890
<4-23,Monica>你非得每次都带他来不可吗
<4-23,Monica>Do you always have to bring him?

138
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,690
<4-24,Ross>我不想把他一个人留在家里好吗
<4-24,Ross>I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright?

139
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,470
<4-24,Ross>我们今天早上第一次吵架了
<4-24,Ross>We- we had our first fight this morning.

140
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,150
<4-24,Ross>我觉得可能和我昨天工作晚归有关
<4-24,Ross>I think it has to do with my working late.

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,200
<4-24,Ross>我无心中说了一些话
<4-24,Ross>I said some things that I didn't mean,

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,770
<4-24,Ross>他就朝我扔大便了
<4-24,Ross>and he- he threw some faeces...

143
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,600
<4-25,Chandler>如果你准备加班
<4-25,Chandler>Y'know, if you're gonna work late,

144
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,120
<4-25,Chandler>我可以替你照顾他
<4-25,Chandler>I could look in on him for you.

145
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,900
<4-26,Ross>这太好了
<4-26,Ross>Oh, that'd be great!

146
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,560
<4-26,Ross>但是如果你去
<4-26,Ross>but if you do,

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,600
<4-26,Ross>请装作是去找他的  好吗
<4-26,Ross>make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay,

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,900
<4-26,Ross>而不是过去帮我忙的
<4-26,Ross>and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.

149
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,580
<4-27,Chandler>好  但他如果问起来  我就得直说了
<4-27,Chandler>Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

150
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,290
<5-1,David>但是我们无法直接实践该理论
<5-1,David>But, you can't actually test this theory.

151
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,060
<5-1,David>因为目前的量子加速器还远无法达到
<5-1,David>because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough

152
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,320
<5-1,David>能够模仿这种状态的能量
<5-1,David>to simulate these conditions...

153
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,160
<5-2,Phoebe>好  我有个问题
<5-2,Phoebe>Okay, alright, I have a question, then.

154
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,970
<5-4,Phoebe>-嗯  -你准备什么时候吻我
<5-4,Phoebe>- Yeah? - Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?

155
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,180
<5-5,David>这是个正当而合理的问题
<5-5,David>Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question.

156
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,550
<5-5,David>而答案是应该是
<5-5,David>And, uh, the answer would be...

157
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,490
<5-5,David>是的  对  我曾想过
<5-5,David>yes. Yes I was.

158
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,330
<5-5,David>但我希望这个特殊的吻能够
<5-5,David>But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss

159
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,880
<5-5,David>在一个特殊的时间中发生
<5-5,David>that happened at this phenomenal moment,

160
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,720
<5-5,David>因为  那个人是你
<5-5,David>because, well, 'cause it's you.

161
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
<5-6,Phoebe>当然
<5-6,Phoebe>Sure.

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,480
<5-7,David>好  但是  我等的时间越久
<5-7,David>Right. But, see, the longer I waited,

163
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,160
<5-7,David>这个吻就会显得越特殊
<5-7,David>the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

164
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,840
<5-7,David>我们现在已经到了一个
<5-7,David>and now we've reached a place

165
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,500
<5-7,David>把桌上的东西都挥下去
<5-7,David>where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like...

166
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,670
<5-7,David>然后把你扔在上面的时刻
<5-7,David>sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.

167
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,860
<5-7,David>而我实际上  并不是那种乱挥东西的人
<5-7,David>And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.

168
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,290
<5-8,Phoebe>大卫  我觉得你是那种可以挥东西的人
<5-8,Phoebe>Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella.

169
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,900
<5-8,Phoebe>你是被困在物理学家体内的猛男
<5-8,Phoebe>I mean, you're a sweeper...trapped inside a physicist's body

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,230
<5-10,Phoebe>-真的  -没错  我确定
<5-10,Phoebe>- Really? - Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it.

171
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,400
<5-10,Phoebe>你应该现在  挥东西  把我丢上去吧
<5-10,Phoebe>You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.

172
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
<5-12,Phoebe>-现在吗  -对  现在
<5-12,Phoebe>- Now? Now? - Yeah, right now. Just....

<5-13,David>You know what? This was just really expensive.

175
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,480
<5-13,David>这个是人家送的
<5-13,David>And I'll take- this was a gift.

176
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,820
<5-14,Phoebe>你现在是在收拾东西了
<5-14,Phoebe>Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.

177
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,420
<5-15,David>好吧  管他的
<5-15,David>Okay, what the hell, what the hell.

178
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,880
<5-15,David>你想被我丢上去  还是自己跳上去
<5-15,David>You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?

<8-10,Ross>让我问问你
<8-10,Ross>Let me ask you something,

252
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,230
<8-10,Ross>如果我带着我的新女友来这里
<8-10,Ross>if I showed up here with my new girlfriend,

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,980
<8-10,Ross>你也不欢迎她进来吗
<8-10,Ross>she wouldn't be welcome in your home?

254
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,990
<8-11,Monica>你的新女友不会尿在我的咖啡桌上
<8-11,Monica>I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

255
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,710
<8-12,Ross>他已经够难为情了  行吗
<8-12,Ross>Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay

256
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
<8-12,Ross>而他还有勇气装作
<8-12,Ross>And for him to have the courage to

257
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,330
<8-12,Ross>什么事情都没发生一样再来到这里
<8-12,Ross>walk back in here like nothing happened...

258
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,090
<8-13,Monica>好啦  叫他离我远点就是了
<8-13,Monica>All right. All right. Just keep him away from me.

<8-15,Monica>天啊  瑞秋  亲爱的  你没事吧
<8-15,Monica>Oh, my gosh! Rachel, honey, are you okay?

<8-15,Monica>保罗在哪儿
<8-15,Monica>Where's Paolo?

264
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,560
<8-16,Rachel>罗马  那个笨蛋错过了飞机
<8-16,Rachel>Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

265
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,930
<8-17,Phoebe>然后呢  你的脸就爆炸了吗
<8-17,Phoebe>And then your face exploded?

266
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,540
<8-17,Phoebe>不是
<8-17,Phoebe>No.

267
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,140
<8-18,Rachel>我当时在机场  准备上出租车
<8-18,Rachel>Okay. I was at the airport getting into a cab...

268
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:50,480
<8-18,Rachel>然后一个拿着袖珍书的金发女人
<8-18,Rachel>when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook-

269
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,690
<8-18,Rachel>就开始朝我吼  好像说车是她先拦下的
<8-18,Rachel>starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first.

270
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,850
<8-18,Rachel>后我记得的事情就是她开始
<8-18,Rachel>And then the next thing I know

271
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,970
<8-18,Rachel>开始拽着我的头发把我拖到了车外
<8-18,Rachel>she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair!

272
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,500
<8-18,Rachel>于是我拿出哨子使劲吹
<8-18,Rachel>So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy

273
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,300
<8-18,Rachel>结果又来了三辆出租车
<8-18,Rachel>and three more cabs show up.

274
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:10,090
<8-18,Rachel>当我想上别的车的时候她就开始打我了
<8-18,Rachel>And as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me

275
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,770
<8-18,Rachel>结果我撞上了路沿
<8-18,Rachel>And I hit my head on the curb

276
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,200
<8-18,Rachel>哨子把嘴唇弄破了
<8-18,Rachel>and cut my lip on my whistle.

277
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,490
<8-18,Rachel>大家玩得还愉快吧
<8-18,Rachel>Everybody having fun at the party?

278
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,490
<8-18,Rachel>-有人吃我的蘸酱吗  -有的
<8-18,Rachel>- Are people eating my dip? - Yes.

279
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,600
<8-19,Sandy>我上周在商场看见你时
<8-19,Sandy>Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week,

280
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,470
<8-19,Sandy>我第一次产生了扒光小精灵衣服的念头
<8-19,Sandy>it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.

281
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,840
<8-20,Joey>-真淫荡  -是的

284
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,790
<8-23,Ross>我并不是让他整晚上都陪着我
<8-23,Ross>I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me,

285
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,840
<8-23,Ross>但他至少过来转转啊

00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,760
<8-52,Phoebe>你再说现在已接近午夜  你必须走了
<8-52,Phoebe>Then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go...

340
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,370
<8-52,Phoebe>因为如果咱俩不能有结果
<8-52,Phoebe>...because you don't wanna start the new year with me

341
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,170
<8-52,Phoebe>你也不愿和我共度新年
<8-52,Phoebe>if you can't finish it.

342
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,330
<8-52,Phoebe>我会想你的  科学家
<8-52,Phoebe>I'm gonna miss you, you scientist guy.

343
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,820
<8-53,Dick Clark>我是迪克·拉克  正在时代广场上直播
<8-53,Dick Clark>Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square.

344
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,900
<8-53,Dick Clark>五彩纸屑如暴风雪般狂舞
<8-53,Dick Clark>We're in a virtual snowstorm

345
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,050
<8-53,Dick Clark>时代广场热闹非凡
<8-53,Dick Clark>of confetti here in Times Square...

346
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,170
<8-54,Joey>一年更比一年好
<8-54,Joey>It gets better every....

347
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,870
<8-54,Joey>好好睡吧  孩子
<8-54,Joey>Here you go, kids.

348
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,040
<8-55,Chandler>然后孔雀就咬了我
<8-55,Chandler>And then the peacock bit me.

349
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,830
<8-55,Chandler>午夜的时候请和我接吻吧
<8-55,Chandler>Please kiss me at midnight!

350
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,040
<8-56,Joey>看见珊蒂没
<8-56,Joey>You seen Sandy?

351
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,190
<8-57,Chandler>我不知该如何告诉你
<8-57,Chandler>Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this...

352
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,870
<8-57,Chandler>她正在莫妮卡房里
<8-57,Chandler>but she's in Monica's bedroom,

353
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,710
<8-57,Chandler>那个叫麦克斯的科学怪人在一起
<8-57,Chandler>getting it on with Max.

354
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,220
<8-57,Chandler>哦  我知道该怎么告诉你
<8-57,Chandler>Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.

355
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,430
<8-58,Rachel>-各位  大球要掉了  -什么
<8-58,Rachel>- Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping. - What?

356
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,950
<8-60,Rachel>大球要掉了
<8-60,Rachel>The ball is dropping!

357
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,230
<8-61,Dick Clark>再过20秒钟就到午夜了
<8-61,Dick Clark>In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

358
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,290
<8-62,Chandler>这一瞬间的快乐就要靠咱们自己了
<8-62,Chandler>And the moment of joy is upon us.

359
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,530
<8-63,Joey>看来那个不约会的协议确实生效了
<8-63,Joey>Looks like that no-date pact worked out.

360
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,760
<8-64,Phoebe>大家好像都很开心  我讨厌这样
<8-64,Phoebe>Everybody looks so happy. I hate that!

361
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,110
<8-65,Monica>不是所有人都开心  嘿  巴比
<8-65,Monica>Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

362
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,240
<8-65,Monica>四  三  二
<8-65,Monica>four, three, two...

363
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,750
<8-66,Chandler>一  新年快乐
<8-66,Chandler>...one! Happy New Year!

364
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,440
<8-66,Chandler>你们知道吗  我刚才算了一下
<8-66,Chandler>Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here.

365
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,360
<8-66,Chandler>虽然我不是数学高手
<8-66,Chandler>I'm no math whiz...

366
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,580
<8-66,Chandler>但是我确实意识到咱们这里有三男三女
<8-66,Chandler>But I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.

367
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,770
<8-67,Phoebe>今晚我不想亲任何人
<8-67,Phoebe>I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.

368
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,040
<8-68,Rachel>我无法亲任何人
<8-68,Rachel>I can't kiss anyone.

369
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,120
<8-69,Monica>那我就要每个人都亲
<8-69,Monica>So, I'm kissing everyone?

370
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,440
<8-70,Joey>不  你不能亲罗斯  他是你哥
<8-70,Joey>No, you can't kiss Ross. That's your brother.

371
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,530
<8-71,Ross>太好了  大家都有亲亲  就我没有
<8-71,Ross>Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

372
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,080
<8-72,Chandler>不管  谁来亲我
<8-72,Chandler>Alright, somebody kiss me.

373
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,390
<8-72,Chandler>谁来亲我  已经到午夜了  谁来亲我
<8-72,Chandler>Somebody kiss me! It's midnight! Somebody kiss me!

374
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,400
<8-72,Chandler>好吧好吧
<8-72,Chandler>All right! All right!

375
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,820
<8-72,Chandler>亲一个
<8-72,Chandler>There!

376
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,280
<9-1,Ross>我真的希望这样能够奏效
<9-1,Ross>I wanted this to work so much.

377
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,560
<9-1,Ross>我是说  我就在这里
<9-1,Ross>I mean I'm still in there,

378
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,810
<9-1,Ross>给他换尿布  替他抓跳蚤
<9-1,Ross>Changing his diapers. Picking his fleas.

379
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,810
<9-1,Ross>但他却视为理所当然
<9-1,Ross>But he's just phoning it in.

380
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,690
<9-1,Ross>深爱某人却得不到回报
<9-1,Ross>Just so hard to accept the fact that

381
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,700
<9-1,Ross>意识到这个现实  真是令人难过
<9-1,Ross>something you love so much doesn't love you back.

382
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,770
<9-2,Rachel>我觉得那个贱人打断了我的牙齿
<9-2,Rachel>I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
