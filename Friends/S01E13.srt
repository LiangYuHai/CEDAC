1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,100
<1-1,Rachel>我受够了  你每次都不敲门就闯进来
<1-1,Rachel>That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock

2
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,970
<1-3,Rachel>-对不起  -你对别人的隐私毫无尊重
<1-3,Rachel>- I'm sorry. - You have no respect for anybody's privacy.

3
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,150
<1-4,Chandler>-慢着  慢着  -你才慢着  太过分了
<1-4,Chandler>- Wait! Wait! - You wait! This is riduculous!

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,860
<1-6,Chandler>-我能说一件事吗  -什么事
<1-6,Chandler>- Can I just say one thing? - What?!

5
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,900
<1-7,Rachel>这块布织的非常松  我仍能看见...
<1-7,Rachel>That's a relatively open weave that I can still see...

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,880
<1-8,Chandler>...你的胸脯
<1-8,Chandler>...your nippular areas.

22
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,800
<1-8,Chandler>亲爱的  给他们讲讲你的病人
<1-8,Chandler>Honey, tell them the story about your patient...

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,960
<2-1,Phoebe>如何把一件事想成另一件事
<2-1,Phoebe>...who thinks things are other things.

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,490
<2-1,Phoebe>例如电话响时她就去洗澡
<2-1,Phoebe>When the phone rings and she takes a shower.

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,790
<2-2,Roger>差不多是那样
<2-2,Roger>That's pretty much it.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,450
<2-4,Roger>-但你说得很好  亲爱的  -谢谢
<2-4,Roger>- But you tell it really well, sweetie. - Thanks. Okay.

<2-7,Phoebe>-他很不错吧  -他好帅  也很喜欢你
<2-7,Phoebe>- Isn't he great? - He's cute. He likes you so much.

30

<2-8,Rachel>我知道  他人很好  而且很复杂
<2-8,Rachel>I know. He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know?

31
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,880
<2-9,Phoebe>算是心理医生中比较正常的了
<2-9,Phoebe>And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,150
<2-10,Monica>你们会在他沙发上做吗
<2-10,Monica>Think you'll do it on his couch?

33
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,230
<2-11,Phoebe>我不知道...那有点奇怪
<2-11,Phoebe>I don't know. That's a little weird.

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,730
<2-11,Phoebe>那是聚乙烯沙发
<2-11,Phoebe>It's vinyl.

35
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,070
<2-12,Rachel>大家还想要点什么吗
<2-12,Rachel>Okay, you guys want anything else?

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,480
<2-14,Rachel>-我要...  -抱歉  卖完了  别人呢
<2-14,Rachel>- Could I have? - Sorry. We're out of those. Anybody else?

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,530
<2-15,Chandler>有什么我不知道吗
<2-15,Chandler>Did I miss something?

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,440
<2-17,Chandler>她还在因为我看见她的胸脯生气
<2-17,Chandler>No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,780
<2-18,Ross>你看她的胸脯干吗
<2-18,Ross>What were you doing seeing her boobies?

40
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,840
<2-19,Chandler>那是意外  我又不是隔条街
<2-19,Chandler>It was an accident. Not like I was across the street

41
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,200
<2-19,Chandler>边吃甜甜圈边用望远镜偷看
<2-19,Chandler>with a telescope and a box of donuts..

42
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,270
<2-20,Rachel>能换个话题吗
<2-20,Rachel>Can we change the subject, please?

43
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,050
<2-21,Phoebe>没错  那不是她的胸脯  而是她的胸部
<2-21,Phoebe>Hollo. These aren't her "boobies." These are her breasts.

44
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,770
<2-22,Rachel>菲比  我要的不只是改变字眼
<2-22,Rachel>Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.

45
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,060
<2-23,Chandler>你知道吗  我不知你为何这么尴尬
<2-23,Chandler>Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed,

46
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,180
<2-23,Chandler>你的胸脯很好看
<2-23,Chandler>they were very nice boobies.

47
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,550
<2-24,Rachel>"好看"它们很"好看"
<2-24,Rachel>"Nice"? They were "nice"?

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,590
<2-24,Rachel>就这样  手套还能用好看形容呢
<2-24,Rachel>That's it? I mean, mittens are "nice."

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,830
<2-25,Chandler>我这里外不是人啊
<2-25,Chandler>Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

50
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,940
<2-26,Roger>你真逗
<2-26,Roger>You're so funny!

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,460
<2-26,Roger>他真的很逗
<2-26,Roger>He's really funny.

52
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,560
<2-26,Roger>他不开玩笑的时候我可不想待在这儿
<2-26,Roger>I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops.

53
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,570
<2-27,Chandler>等等  回去上句  机灵鬼
<2-27,Chandler>Whoa, back up there, sparky.

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,940
<2-27,Chandler>那是什么意思
<2-27,Chandler>What did you mean by that?

55
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,600
<2-28,Roger>你似乎有亲密上的问题
<2-28,Roger>It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues...

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,760
<2-28,Roger>你用你的幽默和人保持距离
<2-28,Roger>...that you use your humor as a way to keep people at a distance.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,730
<2-30,Roger>我才刚认识你  我从没听说过你
<2-30,Roger>I mean, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,600
<2-30,Roger>独子对吧
<2-30,Roger>Only child, right?

59
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,900
<2-30,Roger>父母在你青春期前离婚
<2-30,Roger>Parents divorced before you hit puberty.

60
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,610
<2-31,Chandler>-你怎会知道  -你很典型
<2-31,Chandler>- How did you know that? - It's textbook.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,270
<2-33,Joey>各位  你们都认识我爸吧
<2-33,Joey>Hey, you guys. You all know my dad, right?

62

<2-36,Mr. Tribbiani>我想和我儿子同住
<2-36,Mr. Tribbiani>I'm better off staying with the kid...

65
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,400
<2-36,Mr. Tribbiani>总比来回坐渡轮折腾好
<2-36,Mr. Tribbiani>...than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.

66
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,080

<4-2,Joey>So, how long you been...?

82
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,030
<4-3,Mr. Tribbiani>记得你小时候
<4-3,Mr. Tribbiani>Remember when you were a little kid,

83
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,110
<4-3,Mr. Tribbiani>我常带你去海军军港看大船吗
<4-3,Mr. Tribbiani>I'd take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?

84
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,060
<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>-从那时候就开始了  -不  才6年
<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>- Since then? - No, it's only been six years.

<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>让你觉得我并不一直是个大烂人
<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...

87
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,920
<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>乔伊  你爱过吗
<4-5,Mr. Tribbiani>Joe, you ever been in love?

<4-8,Joey>-你的番茄烧焦了  -别想转移话题
<4-8,Joey>- You're burning tomatoes. - You're one to talk.

90
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,490
<4-9,Mr. Tribbiani>乔伊  你老爸爱得无法自拔
<4-9,Mr. Tribbiani>Joe, your dad's in love big time.

91
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,490
<4-9,Mr. Tribbiani>最糟的是我同时爱着两个女人
<4-9,Mr. Tribbiani>And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.

92
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,260
<4-10,Joey>拜托你告诉我其中一个是妈
<4-10,Joey>Oh, man! Please tell me one of them is Ma.

93
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,630
<4-11,Mr. Tribbiani>当然其中一个是你妈  你是怎么搞的
<4-11,Mr. Tribbiani>Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,110
<5-1,Joey>这就像你某天起床突然发现
<5-1,Joey>It's like if you woke up one day and found out...

95
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,600
<5-1,Joey>你爸过着双面人生
<5-1,Joey>...your dad leads this double life.

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,430
<5-1,Joey>就像是为中情局工作的间谍
<5-1,Joey>He's like actually some spy working for the ClA.

97
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,020
<5-1,Joey>那一定很酷
<5-1,Joey>That'd be cool.

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,400
<5-1,Joey>但这个很烂
<5-1,Joey>This blows!

99
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,870
<5-2,Rachel>为何父母就不能是父母
<5-2,Rachel>I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?

100
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,010
<5-2,Rachel>为何他们就得成为人间男女  为何他们要
<5-2,Rachel>Why do they have to become people? Why do they have?

101
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,740
<5-2,Rachel>为什么...
<5-2,Rachel>Why...

102
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,260
<5-2,Rachel>...别再盯着我的胸部看
<5-2,Rachel>...can't you stop staring at my breasts?

103
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,130
<5-3,Chandler>什么
<5-3,Chandler>What?

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,130
<5-3,Chandler>什么
<5-3,Chandler>What?

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,840
<5-4,Rachel>那一天你还看得不够吗
<5-4,Rachel>Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?

106
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,580
<5-5,Ross>我们都已是成年人
<5-5,Ross>We're all adults here.

107
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,620
<5-5,Ross>此事只有一个解决之道
<5-5,Ross>There's only one way to resolve this.

108
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,460
<5-5,Ross>既然你看过她的胸脯
<5-5,Ross>Since you saw her boobies

109
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,950
<5-5,Ross>你应该让她看你的小弟弟
<5-5,Ross>I think you have to show her your pee-pee.

110
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,370
<5-6,Chandler>知道吗  我看这事没戏
<5-6,Chandler>You know, I don't see that happening.

111
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,260
<5-7,Rachel>拜托  他说得对  以牙还牙
<5-7,Rachel>Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

112
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,560
<5-8,Chandler>我不会让你看我的"牙"的
<5-8,Chandler>Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

113
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,650
<5-10,Phoebe>-是菲比  -还有罗杰
<5-10,Phoebe>- It's Phoebe. - And Rog!

114
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,110
<5-11,Roger>快上来
<5-11,Roger>Come on up.

115
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,960
<5-13,Chandler>这下可好  罗杰来了
<5-13,Chandler>Oh, good! Rog is here.

116
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,270
<5-14,Joey>-罗杰怎么了  -没什么  小事
<5-14,Joey>- What's the matter with Rog? - It's a little thing.

117
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,520
<5-16,Chandler>我讨厌这家伙
<5-16,Chandler>I hate that guy!

118
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,870
<5-17,Ross>他是有点太爱分析  这是他的工作
<5-17,Ross>So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.

119
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,040
<5-17,Ross>别这样  他没那么糟
<5-17,Ross>Come on, he's not that bad.

120
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,970
<6-1,Ross>这你就错了  如果当初我感觉到
<6-1,Ross>You see that's where you're wrong! Why would I marry her...

121
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,440
<6-1,Ross>她是女同志  我何必和她结婚呢
<6-1,Ross>...if I thought in any level that she was a lesbian?

122
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,000
<6-2,Roger>我不知道  或许你想让婚姻失败
<6-2,Roger>I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.

123
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,560
<6-3,Ross>为什么  我为什么  这样为什么
<6-3,Ross>Why? Why would l? Why?

124
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,770
<6-4,Roger>我不知道  或许自信心不足
<6-4,Roger>I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

125
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,470
<6-4,Roger>或许是总比你妹妹好所以有意弥补
<6-4,Roger>Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling.

126
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,010
<6-5,Monica>-或许...  -等等  回到妹妹的话题
<6-5,Monica>- Maybe - Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.

127
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,650
<6-1,Ross>我说不准
<6-1,Ross>Well, I don't know.

128
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,560
<6-2,Roger>你可能有意破坏你的婚姻
<6-2,Roger>You could've sabotaged your marriage...

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,610
<6-6,Roger>让你妹在父母面前不那么失败
<6-6,Roger>...so the sibling would feel like less of a failure as your parent.

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,060
<6-7,Ross>这太荒谬了  她不争气关我什么事
<6-7,Ross>That's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures.

131
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,200
<6-8,Monica>-原来你认为我不争气  -他不错吧
<6-8,Monica>- You think I'm a failure? - Isn't he good?

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,730
<6-10,Ross>恩  不  我不是那个意思
<6-10,Ross>Yeah. No, that's not what I was saying.

133
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,040
<6-11,Monica>你知道吗  多年来我一直以为你支持我
<6-11,Monica>Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,540
<6-11,Monica>但或许你婚姻失败是为了讨好爸妈
<6-11,Monica>But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad

135
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,180
<6-11,Monica>让他们更心疼你
<6-11,Monica>so they'd keep liking you better!

136
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,130
<6-12,Ross>我娶女同志是想让你建立自信
<6-12,Ross>I married a lesbian to make you look good!

137
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,340
<7-1,Rachel>你说得对  我想你的确是对的
<7-1,Rachel>You're right. I mean, you're right.

138
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,870
<7-1,Rachel>那不仅是威宝玩具的问题
<7-1,Rachel>It wasn't just the Weebles,

139
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,940
<7-1,Rachel>而是威宝游乐宫
<7-1,Rachel>but the Weeble Play Palace...

140
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,690
<7-1,Rachel>和威宝游轮的问题
<7-1,Rachel>...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

141
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,900
<7-1,Rachel>它上面的救生艇让威宝能缓缓驶出
<7-1,Rachel>...with this lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.

142
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,760
<7-2,Roger>那滋味不好受
<7-2,Roger>That's tough, tough stuff.

143
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,940
<7-2,Roger>来吧菲比  要看电影我们现在该走了
<7-2,Roger>Come on Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.

144
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,880
<7-3,Phoebe>打起精神来  瑞秋
<7-3,Phoebe>Feel better. Rach.

145
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,230
<7-4,Roger>菲比  我们快来不及了
<7-4,Roger>We're gonna be late, sweetie.

146
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,570
<7-5,Phoebe>-谢谢你做的一切  莫妮卡  -不客气
<7-5,Phoebe>- Thanks for everything, Mon. - No problem.

147
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,080
<7-6,Monica>各位  很高兴和各位再度见面
<7-6,Monica>Listen, it was great seeing you again.

148
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,150
<7-7,Roger>莫妮卡  饼干别吃太多
<7-7,Roger>Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

149
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,930
<7-7,Roger>切记  那只是食物  不是爱
<7-7,Roger>Remember, they're just food, they're not love.

150
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,890
<7-8,Monica>我讨厌这家伙
<7-8,Monica>I hate that guy!

<8-3,Joey>需要帮忙吗
<8-3,Joey>Hey, can we help you?

154
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,930
<8-4,Ronni>不用  谢谢  我在等乔伊·崔比安尼
<8-4,Ronni>No, thanks. I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani.

155
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,870
<8-5,Joey>我就是乔伊·崔比安尼
<8-5,Joey>I'm Joey Tribbiani.

<8-6,Ronni>Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

157
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,710
<8-6,Ronni>你比照片上帅多了
<8-6,Ronni>You're so much cuter than your pictures.

158
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,930
<8-6,Ronni>我是罗妮
<8-6,Ronni>I'm Ronni.

159
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,310
<8-6,Ronni>想吃起司块吗
<8-6,Ronni>Cheese Nip?

160
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,040
<8-7,Chandler>乔伊患有"栓塞"  我来一块
<8-7,Chandler>Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip.

161
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,190
<9-1,Ronni>大部分人在宠物过世后
<9-1,Ronni>Most people, when their pets pass on...

162
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,250
<9-1,Ronni>希望它们躺平就像睡着一样
<9-1,Ronni>they want them laid out like they're sleeping.

163
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,520
<9-1,Ronni>但有时候有些人要他们摆出姿势
<9-1,Ronni>But, occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.

164
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,820
<9-1,Ronni>像追自己的尾巴
<9-1,Ronni>Like chasing their tail.

165
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,930
<9-1,Ronni>跳起接住飞盘
<9-1,Ronni>Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

166
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,460
<9-2,Chandler>乔伊  如果我先走
<9-2,Chandler>Joey, if I go first,

167
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,820
<9-2,Chandler>我的姿势要像找钥匙一样
<9-2,Chandler>I wanna be looking for my keys.

<9-3,Ronni>-这姿势不错  -嗨

188
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,170
<9-22,Joey>也就是不准你跟女友睡在一起
<9-22,Joey>That means no sleeping with your girlfriend.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,270
<9-31,Joey>不然就向妈自首  这样是不对的
<9-31,Joey>Then come clean with Ma! This is not right!

<9-31,Joey>-对  但是  -我不想听  快进我房里

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,100
<9-31,Joey>别踢了
<9-31,Joey>Hey, kickie!

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,440
<10-1,Chandler>-你在干什么  -找寻舒适的位置
<10-1,Chandler>- What are you doing? - Getting comfortable.

203
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,870
<10-2,Joey>-穿着内裤我睡不着  -你非穿不可
<10-2,Joey>- I can't sleep in my underwear. - Well, you're gonna.

204
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,950
<10-3,Chandler>我一直在想...
<10-3,Chandler>I was thinking about

205
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,910
<10-4,Joey>我总看着女人一个接一个地来
<10-4,Joey>how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls....

206
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,540
<10-5,Chandler>她们是首尾相接
<10-5,Chandler>Are they end-to-end,

207
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,300
<10-5,Chandler>还是像煎饼一样叠起来
<10-5,Chandler>or tall, like pancakes?

208
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,500
<10-6,Joey>你懂我意思的
<10-6,Joey>Y'know what I mean,

209
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
<10-6,Joey>我总是跟很多女人出去约会
<10-6,Joey>about how I'm always going out with all these women.

210
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,030
<10-6,Joey>我总想着  当梦中情人出现时
<10-6,Joey>I always figured, when the right one comes along...

211
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,580
<10-6,Joey>我就会勇往直前  坚持到最后
<10-6,Joey>I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?

212
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,740
<10-6,Joey>但如今看见我爸...我转念一想
<10-6,Joey>Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking

213
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,020
<10-7,Chandler>你不是他  你是你自己
<10-7,Chandler>You're not him, you're you.

214
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,060
<10-7,Chandler>当全天下都希望你继承你爸的事业时
<10-7,Chandler>When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business,

215
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,490
<10-7,Chandler>你有屈服吗
<10-7,Chandler>did you cave?

216
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,980
<10-8,Joey>-没有  -没有
<10-8,Joey>- No. - No.

217
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,750
<10-9,Chandler>你决心从事不稳定的演员事业
<10-9,Chandler>You chose the out-of-work-actor business.

218
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,850
<10-9,Chandler>这不是件容易的事  但你办到了
<10-9,Chandler>That wasn't easy, but you did it.

219
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,740
<10-9,Chandler>我也相信当你的梦中情人出现时
<10-9,Chandler>I believe when the right woman comes along...

220
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,590
<10-9,Chandler>你会有勇气对她说
<10-9,Chandler>...you'll have the courage and the guts to say,

221
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,740
<10-10,Joey>"不  谢谢  我已婚"
<10-10,Joey>"No, thanks, I'm married."

222
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,800
<10-11,Chandler>-你真的这样认为  -真的
<10-11,Chandler>- You really think so? - Yeah, I really do.

223
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,120
<10-13,Chandler>-谢谢  钱德勒  -滚开
<10-13,Chandler>- Thanks, Chandler. - Get off!

224
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,420
<11-2,Monica>-嗨  -有事吗
<11-2,Monica>- Hi. - Hi. May I help you?

225

<13-8,Mrs. Tribbiani>总是大吼大叫  总是不开心
<13-8,Mrs. Tribbiani>Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.

272
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,490
<13-8,Mrs. Tribbiani>连木材店和瓶中船也无法让他开心
<13-8,Mrs. Tribbiani>Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.

273
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,620

<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>自从那个"卷毛狗"出现后
<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along...

283
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,040
<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>他感到极其内疚而开始对我体贴
<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>... he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.

284
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:18,040
<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>他跟我恩爱许多  每天都像结婚纪念日
<13-10,Mrs. Tribbiani>He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary.

285

<13-11,Joey>-那我该为你高兴  -不需要
<13-11,Joey>- I'm happy for you? - Well, don't be!

<13-16,Mrs. Tribbiani>Could I take her?

<14-4,Phoebe>他们不能...
<14-4,Phoebe>...in that they don't.

301
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,840
<14-5,Roger>他们不能怎么
<14-5,Roger>They don't?

302
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,140
<14-6,Phoebe>他们不像我一样能看见你的好处
<14-6,Phoebe>But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.

303
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,040
<14-6,Phoebe>他们看不见你美好和体贴的一面
<14-6,Phoebe>They don't see all the good and sweet stuff.

304
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,530
<14-6,Phoebe>-他们认为你有点...  -什么
<14-6,Phoebe>- They think you're a little - What?

305
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,730
<14-8,Phoebe>紧张和令人发毛
<14-8,Phoebe>Intense and creepy.

306

<14-10,Phoebe>但我菲比不这么认为
<14-10,Phoebe>But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

307
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,420
<14-11,Roger>我对他们的反应毫不感到惊讶
<14-11,Roger>I'm not at all surprised about that.

308
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,110
<14-12,Phoebe>是吗  看  这就是我欣赏你的地方

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,710
<14-13,Roger>当群体动力失调时
<14-13,Roger>Actually it's quite typical behavior...

310
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,830
<14-13,Roger>这是很典型的反应
<14-13,Roger>...when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.

311
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,620
<14-13,Roger>这种相互依赖  情绪激动
<14-13,Roger>You know, this kind of codependent, emotionally stunted...

312
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,430
<14-13,Roger>坐在那家傻兮兮的咖啡屋

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,050
<14-13,Roger>拿着又大又蠢的咖啡杯
<14-13,Roger>with your stupid big cups...

314
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,670
<14-13,Roger>或许还有乳头在上面
<14-13,Roger>...which might as well have nipples on them.

315
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,420
<14-13,Roger>你们全都想着"说说我是怎样的人"
<14-13,Roger>And you're all like, "Oh, define me! Define me!

<15-2,Joey>He's gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted.

319
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,830
<15-2,Joey>我妈要继续假装她一无所知
<15-2,Joey>Ma will keep pretending she doesn't know.

320
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,570
<15-2,Joey>我妹蒂娜不能再见她丈夫
<15-2,Joey>And my sister, Tina, can't see her husband.

321
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,870
<15-2,Joey>因为他接到禁制令
<15-2,Joey>He got a restraining order.

322
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,980
<15-2,Joey>这两件事没关系  但我今天才听说
<15-2,Joey>Which has nothing to do with it. I found out today.

326
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,690
<15-6,Joey>到了时候  你只能顺其自然
<15-6,Joey>After a certain point, you gotta let go.

327
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,670
<15-6,Joey>就算你更有见识  还是得让他们自己去犯错
