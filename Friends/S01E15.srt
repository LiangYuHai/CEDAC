<6-13,Chandler>所以我最好和你平分吃
<6-13,Chandler>so I better split this with you.

143
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,170
<6-14,Monica>它本来就应该那么小  这是餐前开胃菜
<6-14,Monica>It's supposed to be small. It's a pre-appetizer.

144
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,960
<6-14,Monica>法国人称它为"阿姆兹布许"

150
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,940

156
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,510
<6-24,Rachel>我应该继续保持业余的姿态
<6-24,Rachel>And I'm maintaining my amateur status

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,880
<8-2,Ross>但也不算一败涂地  我们以爱抚收场
<8-2,Ross>But it wasn't a total loss. We ended up cuddling.

<13-10,Ross>我是讲下流话的行家
<13-10,Ross>I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

310
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,930
<13-10,Ross>那简直是天下最具巧思的下流话
<13-10,Ross>It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard.

<13-10,Ross>At one point, there were villagers.

314
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,220
<13-11,Joey>然后呢
<13-11,Joey>And?

315
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,340
<13-12,Ross>下流话讲完后已经有点晚了
<13-12,Ross>By the time we finished all the dirty talk it was kind of late

316
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,210
<13-12,Ross>而且我们也有点没劲了  所以
<13-12,Ross>and we were kind of exhausted, so...

319
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,710
<13-16,Rachel>或许吧  但我们不是该等钱德勒吗
<13-16,Rachel>Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

320
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,060
<13-17,Joey>他到底跑哪儿去了
<13-17,Joey>Where the hell is he?

322
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,290
<14-1,Chandler>但我看着"周净计"  它让我相当不高兴
<14-1,Chandler>...but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!

323
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,130
<14-1,Chandler>我跟你讲清楚
<14-1,Chandler>Let me tell you something.

324

<15-5,Phoebe>That means it's working.

329
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,160
<15-6,Steve>-痛不痛  -不痛.
<15-6,Steve>- Does this hurt? - No.
