10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,620

<2-1,Ross>I don't know whether he's testing me...or just acting out,

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,070
<2-1,Ross>但我的猴子已经失控了
<2-1,Ross>... but my monkey is out of control!

<2-1,Ross>他不断清除我答录机上的留言
<2-1,Ross>He keeps erasing the messages on my machine.

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,010
<9-28,Phoebe>也许现在不同意了
<9-28,Phoebe>Maybe now it's not okay.

234
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,670
<9-29,Joey>也许我对于你的不同意也不同意了
<9-29,Joey>Okay. Maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.

235
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,330
<9-30,Phoebe>好吧
<9-30,Phoebe>Okay!

236
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,060
<9-31,Chandler>快织  好女人  快织
<9-31,Chandler>Knit, good woman, knit!

237
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,420
<10-1,Chandler>克莱斯勒大楼就在那儿
<10-1,Chandler>And that's the Chrysler Building right there.

238
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,100
<10-3,Nina>-妮娜  -道格拉斯先生  领带不错
<10-3,Nina>- Nina! - Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.

239
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,680
<10-4,Mr. Douglas>她还在这里
<10-4,Mr. Douglas>She's still here.

240
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,060
<10-5,Chandler>没错  她还在  我没有提醒你吗
<10-5,Chandler>Yes. Yes, she is. Didn't I memo you on this?

241
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,680
<10-5,Chandler>我开除她后  接到她心理医生的电话
<10-5,Chandler>After I let her go, I got a call from her psychiatrist,

242
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,900
<10-5,Chandler>佛...佛...佛林大夫
<10-5,Chandler>Dr. Flennan Dr. Flennan Dr. Flynn.

243
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,450
<10-6,Chandler>他告诉我她一时无法接受这个事实
<10-6,Chandler>And he informed me that she took the news rather badly.

244
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,370
<10-6,Chandler>老实说  他提到"狂暴"这个词
<10-6,Chandler>In fact, he mentioned the word "frenzy."

245
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,390
<10-7,Mr. Douglas>开什么玩笑  她明明看起来...
<10-7,Mr. Douglas>You're kidding! She seems so

246
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,200
<10-8,Chandler>不  妮娜她...
<10-8,Chandler>No. Nina? She's

247
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,380
<10-8,Chandler>事实上  如果你现在问她
<10-8,Chandler>In fact, if you asked her now...

248
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,180
<10-8,Chandler>她根本记不得被开除这件事
<10-8,Chandler>...she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.

249
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,380
<10-10,Chandler>-难以置信  -你不得不信
<10-10,Chandler>- That's unbelievable. - And yet believable.

250
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,410
<10-10,Chandler>因此我决定不再开除她
<10-10,Chandler>So I decided not to fire her again

251
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:09,730
<10-10,Chandler>直到她对自己和他人不构成威胁为止
<10-10,Chandler>until she'll be no threat to herself or others.

252
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,320
<10-11,Mr. Douglas>看来人们永远无法了解他人心中所想
<10-11,Mr. Douglas>I guess you never know what's going on inside a person's head.

253
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,850
<10-12,Chandler>我想这就是"心理学"名字的由来  先生
<10-12,Chandler>Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.

254
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,960
<11-1,Soothing male voice>爸妈永远忘不了这声音
<11-1,Soothing male voice>The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

255
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,350
<11-1,Soothing male voice>这一切  说到底  是生产的奇迹
<11-1,Soothing male voice>For this, after all, is the miracle of birth.

256
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,710
<11-2,Teacher>请开灯  这一集是生宝宝
<11-2,Teacher>Lights, please. And that's having a baby.

257
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,840
<11-2,Teacher>下周是我们的最后一堂课
<11-2,Teacher>Next week is our final class.

258
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,400
<11-3,Ross>苏珊  准备接球
<11-3,Ross>Susan, go deep.

259
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,860
<11-5,Susan>-这太离谱了...  -怎么了亲爱的
<11-5,Susan>- It's just impossible. - What is, honey?

260
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,390
<11-6,Carol>那个女人的所作所为
<11-6,Carol>What that woman did.

261
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,430
<11-6,Carol>我不会这么做的  他得留在我体内
<11-6,Carol>I am not doing that. It'll just have to stay in.

262
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,150
<11-6,Carol>一切和原来一样  他得留在我体内
<11-6,Carol>Everything will be the same. It'll just stay in.

263
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,180
<11-7,Ross>卡罗尔  亲爱的  不会有事的
<11-7,Ross>Carol, honey, it'll be all right.

264
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,150
<11-7,Ross>你知道什么
<11-7,Ross>What do you know?

265
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,260
<11-8,Carol>又没人问你,
<11-8,Carol>No one's asking you,

266
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,440
<11-8,Carol>"我能将这肉块穿过你的鼻孔吗"
<11-8,Carol>"Mind if we push this pot roast through your nostril?"

267
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,730
<11-9,Susan>卡罗尔  亲爱的  深呼吸
<11-9,Susan>Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.

268
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,260
<11-10,Susan>我知道你很惶恐  往长远想
<11-10,Susan>I know it's frightening. But big picture:

269
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,980
<11-10,Susan>生产过程只是一天
<11-10,Susan>The birth part is just one day.

270
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,770
<11-10,Susan>结束后  我们这辈子都是他的父母了
<11-10,Susan>When it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.

271
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,020

<11-11,Susan>I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross?

<12-3,Ross>-你才刚知道  -我一直都知道要有孩子了
<12-3,Ross>- This is news to you? - I knew I was having a baby.

275
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,460
<12-3,Ross>只是没意识到要担起父亲的责任
<12-3,Ross>I just never realized the baby was having me.

276
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,060
<12-5,Ross>-你会是个好爸爸的  -你怎会知道
<12-5,Ross>- You'll be great. - How can you say that?

277

<12-5,Ross>我连阻止马塞尔吃浴垫都办不到
<12-5,Ross>I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.

284
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,060
<12-12,Phoebe>你们有没有...你明白的  就是那啥
<12-12,Phoebe>Have you two, you know, like, you know?

285
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,170
<12-12,Phoebe>你知道的  对吧
<12-12,Phoebe>You know, yet?

286
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,440
<12-13,Joey>不关你的事  但是还没有  行了吗
<12-13,Joey>Not that it's any of your business, but no, we haven't.

287
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,320
<12-14,Joey>你是指性吧  对吧
<12-14,Joey>You meant sex, right?

288
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,320
<13-1,Nina>-有空吗  -当然  妮娜  什么事
<13-1,Nina>- Do you have a sec? - Sure. Nina. What's up?

<13-3,Nina>我不知道  最近几天大家怎么都避开我
<13-3,Nina>I don't know.The past few days, people have been avoiding me

290
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,460
<13-3,Nina>还怪怪地看我
<13-3,Nina>and giving me these really strange looks.

291
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,670
<13-4,Chandler>或许是因为他们在嫉妒我们
<13-4,Chandler>Well, maybe that's because they're jealous of us.

292
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,970
<13-5,Nina>或许吧  但他们为何拿走我的剪刀
<13-5,Nina>Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.

293
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,890
<13-6,Chandler>或许是因为你被升职的缘故
<13-6,Chandler>Maybe that's because you're getting a big raise!

294
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,210
<13-8,Chandler>-我升职了  -当然  为什么不呢

<13-10,Chandler>Helen, could you make sure

299
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,380
<13-11,Helen>你还要我拿她的心理状况档案到人事部吗
<13-11,Helen>You still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?

300
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,630
<13-13,Chandler>-她说什么  -海伦喝醉了
<13-13,Chandler>- What? - Helen drinks.

302
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,090
<14-1,Chandler>最后我把一切都告诉她了
<14-1,Chandler>I end up told her everything.

303
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,020
<14-2,Rachel>她的反应如何
<14-2,Rachel>How'd she take it?

304
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,250
<14-3,Chandler>还不错  除了拿钉书机钉我之外
<14-3,Chandler>Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.

305
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,830
<14-3,Chandler>提示一下  以后遇见类似的状况
<14-3,Chandler>A tip. If you're ever in a similar situation...

306
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,700
<14-3,Chandler>切记别把手放在桌上
<14-3,Chandler>... never, ever leave your hand on the desk.

307
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,790
<14-4,Monica>我知道该怎么调这个了
<14-4,Monica>Okay, I think I get how to do this.

308
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,550
<14-5,Phoebe>我们能把这关掉吗
<14-5,Phoebe>Can we turn it off?

309
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,190
<14-5,Phoebe>让这个画面消失  我实在看不下去
<14-5,Phoebe>Make them go away because I can't watch.

310
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,120
<14-6,Monica>好了  菲比  现在没有了
<14-6,Monica>Okay, Pheebs, they're gone.

311
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,060
<14-8,Monica>你还好吧
<14-8,Monica>Are you all right?

312
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:07,750
<14-9,Phoebe>还不是厄休拉惹的祸
<14-9,Phoebe>It's just this whole stupid Ursula thing.

313
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,590
<14-10,Rachel>菲比  我冒昧问下...
<14-10,Rachel>Pheebs, can I ask?

314
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,140
<14-10,Rachel>他和她约会真有那么糟吗
<14-10,Rachel>So he's going out with her. Is it really so terrible?

315
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,520
<14-10,Rachel>是的
<14-10,Rachel>Yeah.

316
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,500
<14-11,Phoebe>我不是说她很坏还是怎样
<14-11,Phoebe>I'm not saying she's evil or anything.

317
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,280
<14-11,Phoebe>她总是弄坏我的东西
<14-11,Phoebe>She's just always breaking my stuff.

318
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,660
<14-11,Phoebe>我8岁时不肯让她玩我的卡通水杯
<14-11,Phoebe>When I was 8, and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos,

319
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,780
<14-11,Phoebe>她把它扔到公车下
<14-11,Phoebe>so she threw it under the bus.

320
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,090
<14-11,Phoebe>然后  还有个蓝迪·布朗  就像
<14-11,Phoebe>And then there's Randy Brown, who was like

321
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,840
<14-11,Phoebe>你们有没有异性好友变成男友的情况
<14-11,Phoebe>Have you ever had a boyfriend who was your best friend?

322
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,400
<14-13,Phoebe>我当时的状况就是如此
<14-13,Phoebe>That's what he was for me.

323
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,710
<14-13,Phoebe>她把他抢走又伤了他的心
<14-13,Phoebe>And she kind of stole him away and then broke his heart.

324
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,760
<14-13,Phoebe>他从此不和我说话
<14-13,Phoebe>Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

325
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,760
<14-13,Phoebe>因为他说他不愿再见像她的人
<14-13,Phoebe>He didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.

326
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,960
<14-15,Phoebe>我知道乔伊不是我男朋友或者水杯
<14-15,Phoebe>I know Joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos...

327
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,740
<14-15,Phoebe>或其他的什么  但是
<14-15,Phoebe>...or anything, but

328
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,960
<14-17,Monica>-你不会失去他的  -你得找乔伊谈谈
<14-17,Monica>- You won't lose him. - You gotta talk to Joey.

329
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,100
<14-19,Ross>-说得轻巧  -别这样  他又不知道这些
<14-19,Ross>-Yeah. - Come on, he didn't know these staff.

330
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,170
<14-20,Phoebe>-如果他知道你的感受  -但他爱上她了
<14-20,Phoebe>- lf he knew how you felt - But he's falling in love with her.

331
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,530
<14-21,Rachel>拜托  他们才约会一个星期
<14-21,Rachel>Please. They've been going out a week.

332
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,640
<14-21,Rachel>根本还没上床  关系还没确定下来
<14-21,Rachel>They haven't even slept together yet. That's not serious.

333
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,200
<14-22,Phoebe>好吧  好吧
<14-22,Phoebe>Okay. Okay.

334
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,990
<14-22,Phoebe>需要帮忙吗
<14-22,Phoebe>May we help you?

336
