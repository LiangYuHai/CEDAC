<1-12,Monica>你没有保险吗
<1-12,Monica>You don't have insurance?

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,390
<1-13,Rachel>怎么了  要多少钱
<1-13,Rachel>Why, how much is this gonna cost?

39
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,330
<1-14,Monica>我不知道  单是X光就可能得好几百元
<1-14,Monica>I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,710
<1-15,Rachel>我们该怎么办
<1-15,Rachel>Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?

45
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,170
<1-20,Monica>这是保险欺诈
<1-20,Monica>That's insurance fraud.

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,900
<1-21,Rachel>好吧  算了  我直接回家算了

<1-26,Monica>I am really an idiot.

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,020
<1-26,Monica>我替我朋友填资料时
<1-26,Monica>You see, I was filling out my friend's form,

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,210
<1-26,Monica>填的不是她的资料而是我的
<1-26,Monica>and instead of putting her information, I put mine.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,320
<1-27,Nurse>你真是个笨蛋
<1-27,Nurse>You are an idiot. .

<1-28,Monica>没错  这就是我  我就是那么笨
<1-28,Monica>Yep, that's me, I am that stupid.

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,930
<2-1,Ross>我昨晚梦见自己在和我儿子在玩橄榄球
<2-1,Ross>I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.

57
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,690
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>真温馨
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>That's nice.

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,500
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>不  他是球
<2-2,Chandler and Joey>No, no, with him.

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,820
<2-3,Ross>我在球场上  他们用我儿子开球
<2-3,Ross>I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,800
<2-3,Ross>我知道自己得做点什么
<2-3,Ross>And I, I know I've gotta do something

61
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,370
<2-3,Ross>因为坦帕湾队的防守球员逐渐逼近
<2-3,Ross>'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.

62
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,210
<2-4,Joey>坦帕湾队烂得要死
<2-4,Joey>Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,530
<2-5,Ross>没错  但只有我和我儿子
<2-5,Ross>Right, but, it is just me and the baby,

64
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,980
<2-5,Ross>我想我们死定了
<2-5,Ross>so I'm thinkin' they can take us.

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,080
<2-5,Ross>所以我只好把我儿子扔出去
<2-5,Ross>And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,040
<2-6,Chandler>什么  你疯啦  那是你儿子
<2-6,Chandler>What are you crazy? That's a baby!

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,290
<2-7,Joey>那他该擒杀吗
<2-7,Joey>He should take the sack?

68
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,570
<2-8,Ross>总之  突然我又到了前场
<2-8,Ross>Anyway, suddenly I'm down field,

69
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,620
<2-8,Ross>我发现该接住我儿子的人是我
<2-8,Ross>and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?

70
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,850
<2-8,Ross>但我绝对来不及赶过去
<2-8,Ross>Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time,

71
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,900
<2-8,Ross>于是我跑啊跑
<2-8,Ross>So I am running, and running,

72
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,720
<2-8,Ross>然后就惊醒了
<2-8,Ross>and that, that is when I woke up.

73
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,230
<2-8,Ross>看  我根本还没准备好当爸爸
<2-8,Ross>See I, I am so not ready to be a father.

74
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,070
<2-9,Chandler>你没问题的
<2-9,Chandler>Hey, you're gonna be fine.

<2-9,Chandler>You're gonna make a great dad.

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,180
<2-10,Joey>没错罗斯  你和你儿子只需要提高防守
<2-10,Joey>Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,970
<2-11,Joey>你们去过彩虹厅吗
<2-11,Joey>Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room?

79
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,390
<2-11,Joey>真有那么贵
<2-11,Joey>Is it real expensive?

80
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,500
<2-12,Chandler>只有点东西吃才会贵
<2-12,Chandler>Well, only if you order stuff.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,700
<2-13,Joey>我今晚要带厄休拉去  今天是她生日
<2-13,Joey>I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
