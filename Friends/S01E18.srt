<4-41,Ross>如果我想赢  就得有人输
<4-41,Ross>For me to win, others have to lose.

<4-41,Ross>如果想和我玩牌  就别指望我做个好人
<4-41,Ross>If you're gonna play pocker with me, don't expect me to be a nice guy.

131
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,730
<4-41,Ross>因为牌一发出
<4-41,Ross>Because once those cards are dealt....

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,270
<5-4,Chandler>得了吧  不然你为何学黑道电影讲话
<5-4,Chandler>Come on. What was with that Black Bart speech?

138
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,930
<5-4,Chandler>"玩起牌来  我就不是个好人"

140
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,980
<5-6,Joey>我可不这么认为  因为我觉得你爱她
<5-6,Joey>No, I don't think so, because I think you love her!

141
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,080
<5-7,Ross>不  或许我曾对她有爱意
<5-7,Ross>No. I might have had feelings for her at one time.

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,450
<5-7,Ross>但我已心灰意冷
