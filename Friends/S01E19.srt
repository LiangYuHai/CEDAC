00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,870
<8-35,Monica>-不  -一点也不
<8-35,Monica>- No. - Not at all.

237
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,710
<8-36,Rachel>或许是因为你们那四年都当我不存在
<8-36,Rachel>Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.

238
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,530
<8-37,Luisa>说一句"早安  露易莎"有那么难吗
<8-37,Luisa>Would it have been hard to say, "Morning,Luisa"...

239
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,240
<8-37,Luisa>或是"好漂亮的连身裤"

<8-39,Luisa>你有自己的烦恼
<8-39,Luisa>You had your own problems.

243

<8-39,Luisa>可你实在是个贱货
<8-39,Luisa>But you. What a bitch!

245
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,370
<8-41,Monica>这样吧  别计较了
<8-41,Monica>You know what? Be that as it may...

246
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,590
<8-41,Monica>猴子的事情你能帮我们吗  念念旧情
<8-41,Monica>...could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake?

248
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,980
<8-41,Monica>加油  山猫队

<8-42,Luisa>I could. But I won't.

250
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,610
<8-42,Luisa>如果我找到猴子  他就是我的了
<8-42,Luisa>If I find that monkey, he's mine.

251
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,310
<9-1,Chandler>抱歉
<9-1,Chandler>Sorry.

<9-10,Chandler>We may not know about radiators...

264
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,740
<9-10,Chandler>我们可是冷暖环境控制的专家
<9-10,Chandler>... but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,010
<9-11,Joey>我们不是正在忙吗

<11-5,Ross>现在我的脚又受伤了
<11-5,Ross>And now I have a broken foot.

297
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,330
<11-5,Ross>猴子没了脚又受伤

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,660
<11-9,Ross>这种事常发生在你身上
<11-9,Ross>Things just sort of happen around you!

308
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,070
<11-9,Ross>你活在瑞秋的世界中  做着瑞秋的事情
<11-9,Ross>You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing"...

309
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,980
<11-9,Ross>完全无视别人的猴子

<11-41,Rachel>If you take this monkey,

342
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,900
<11-41,Rachel>我将失去我生命中重要的人
<11-41,Rachel>I'll lose an important person in my life.

343
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,340
<11-41,Rachel>你可以尽情恨我  但请别折磨他
<11-41,Rachel>You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.

344
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:40,970
<11-41,Rachel>别这样  露易莎
<11-41,Rachel>Come on, Luisa.

345
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,670
<11-41,Rachel>此时你有机会做一个宽容的人
<11-41,Rachel>You have a chance to be the bigger person here.

346
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,500
<11-42,Luisa>把握机会吧
<11-42,Luisa>Take it!

347
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,040
<11-42,Luisa>不
<11-42,Luisa>No.

348
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,800
<11-43,Rachel>那么  我只好告诉你的长官
<11-43,Rachel>All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her...

349
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,720
<11-43,Rachel>你在我朋友的屁股上开了一枪
<11-43,Rachel>...you shot my friend with a dart!

350
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,700
<12-1,Ross>把这件衣服脱掉多好  是不是
<12-1,Ross>It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?

351
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,710
<12-1,Ross>或是这样穿着也不错
<12-1,Ross>Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

352
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,100
<12-2,Rachel>配上合适的女鞋  就是完美的一套了
<12-2,Rachel>With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

353
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,300
<12-3,Ross>抱歉  我之前对你这么凶
<12-3,Ross>Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before

354
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,360
<12-4,Rachel>不  罗斯  都是我的错  我差点弄丢
<12-4,Rachel>No, Ross, come in, it was my fault. I almost lost your

355
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,680
<12-5,Ross>是啊  但他也是你找回来的  你真厉害
<12-5,Ross>Yeah, but you got him back. You were great.

356
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,990
<12-5,Ross>那瓶酒还在
<12-5,Ross>We still have that bottle of wine.

357
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,070
<12-5,Ross>有心情喝杯葡萄酒吗
<12-5,Ross>Are you in the mood for something grape?

358
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,550
<12-6,Rachel>-好呀  -很好
<12-6,Rachel>- Sure, that would be good. - All right.

359
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,180
<12-7,Ross>隔壁一定在用吸尘器
<12-7,Ross>The neighbors must be vacuuming.

360
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,780
<12-7,Ross>只要我们在这儿就成
<12-7,Ross>Well, as long as we're here...

361
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,370
<12-7,Ross>不谈那个话题
<12-7,Ross>...and not on the subject....

362
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,290
<12-7,Ross>我在想
<12-7,Ross>I was thinking about...

363
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,990
<12-7,Ross>我们刚刚实在是恶言相向
<12-7,Ross>... how mad we got at each other before.

364
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,300
<12-7,Ross>大概是因为我们太
<12-7,Ross>And maybe it was partially because of how we

365
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,660
<12-8,Barry>-瑞秋  -巴瑞
<12-8,Barry>- Rachel? - Barry?

366
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,880
<12-10,Barry>我办不到  我无法和明蒂结婚
<12-10,Barry>I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

367
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,360
<12-10,Barry>我想我爱的人依然是你
<12-10,Barry>I think I'm still in love with you.

368
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,300
<12-12,Ross>我们一定得开始锁门了
<12-12,Ross>We have got to start locking that door!

369
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,190
<13-1,Monica>这是我参演《音乐之声》
<13-1,Monica>This is me in The Sound of Music.

370
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,630
<13-1,Monica>-看到冯·特拉普家的孩子们没  -没
<13-1,Monica>- See the von Trapp kids? - No.

372
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,640
<13-3,Monica>那是因为我在他们前面
<13-3,Monica>That's because I'm in front of them.

373
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,300
<13-4,Chandler>我以为那是阿尔卑斯山
<13-4,Chandler>I thought that was an alp.

374
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,130
<13-5,Monica>我的高中时代并不如意
<13-5,Monica>High school wasn't my favorite time.

375
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,480
<13-6,Joey>说不准  我爱高中
<13-6,Joey>I don't know. I loved high school.

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,700
<13-6,Joey>四年的舞会  约会和做爱
<13-6,Joey>It was four years of parties, dating and sex and

<13-7,Chandler>我和400个男孩上的住宿学校
<13-7,Chandler>Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.

378
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,720
<13-7,Chandler>每次做爱都是一次生活方式的重大抉择
<13-7,Chandler>Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

379
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,960
<13-8,Monica>那不是回到一百万年前
<13-8,Monica>Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

380
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,150
<13-9,Phoebe>我的屁股蛋儿醒了
<13-9,Phoebe>My butt cheek is waking up!
