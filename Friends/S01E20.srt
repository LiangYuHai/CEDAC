00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,040
<1-1,Chandler>我真不敢相信你会这么说
<1-1,Chandler>I can't believe you'd actually say that.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,620
<1-1,Chandler>我不是咸味先生而是花生先生
<1-1,Chandler>I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,930
<1-2,Joey>才怪  咸味先生是个水手
<1-2,Joey>No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor.

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,530
<1-4,Monica>有个变态拿着望远镜
<1-4,Monica>There's some creep out there with a telescope.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,330
<1-5,Ross>我真不敢相信他在看我们
<1-5,Ross>I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,730
<1-6,Rachel>真恶心

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,470
<1-7,Chandler>而且很不爽
<1-7,Chandler>And not in a good way.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,510
<1-8,Phoebe>怎会有人这样
<1-8,Phoebe>How can people do that?

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,080

<1-8,Phoebe>You guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,820
<2-1,Chandler>我跟你们说  几年后  学童将会把它
<2-1,Chandler>I'm telling you, years from now, school children will study it...

32
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,180
<2-1,Chandler>奉为首次约会完美案例研究
<2-1,Chandler>...as one of the greatest first dates of all time.

33
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,750
<2-1,Chandler>太令人难以置信了

<2-3,Chandler>It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,940
<2-4,Joey and Ross>-我说的对吧  -对  让她悬着心吧
<2-4,Joey and Ross>- I'm right. Right  - Yeah, let her dangle.

40
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,660
<2-5,Monica>我无法相信我爸妈催着我找你们这种男人
<2-5,Monica>I can't believe my parents are actually pushing me to find one of you people.

41
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,930
<2-6,Phoebe>算了  行动吧

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,160
<2-7,Chandler>我得说一句  这还是旧金山特色
<2-7,Chandler>Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,510
<2-7,Chandler>-机器声  -她的答录机吗
<2-7,Chandler>- I got her machine. - Her answering machine?

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,480
<2-9,Chandler>不  有趣的是  她的落叶清扫机接的
<2-9,Chandler>No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,890
<2-10,Phoebe>那你为何不留言
<2-10,Phoebe>So, why didn't you say anything?

47
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,050
<2-11,Chandler>不行  上次我想随意留两句话的时候
<2-11,Chandler>No. Last time I left a spontaneous message...

48
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,060
<2-11,Chandler>最后说了"对滴  是这样哦"
<2-11,Chandler>... I ended up using the phrase,"Yes,indeed-io."

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,380
<2-12,Monica>看  是瑞秋和巴瑞

<2-14,Phoebe>-他们只是在讲话  -他是否神情落寞
<2-14,Phoebe>- They're just talking. - Does he look upset?

53
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,550
<2-15,Ross>他是否像被告知滚远点的样子
<2-15,Ross>Does he look like he was told to shove anything?

54
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,500
<2-16,Phoebe>没有  其实他正在微笑
<2-16,Phoebe>No. Actually, he's smiling.

<2-18,Phoebe>对街的男人刚踢了一只鸽子
<2-18,Phoebe>That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,150
<2-19,Chandler>基本上  法案就是这么成为法律的
<2-19,Chandler>And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-21,Chandler>懂了吗  嗨  瑞秋
<2-21,Chandler>See? Hey, Rach.

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,180
<2-24,Phoebe>今天真不是鸟儿的好日子
<2-24,Phoebe>Not a good day for birds.

65
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,100

<2-26,Ross>别再送你花  别再来烦你之前还是之后
<2-26,Ross>...to stop calling,stop sending flowers and to generally leave you alone?

69
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,860
<2-27,Rachel>老实说  我没机会开口
<2-27,Rachel>Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

70
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
<2-27,Rachel>能再见到他的感觉真好
<2-27,Rachel>It was just so nice to see him again.

<2-28,Ross>瑞秋  这是怎么回事

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,080
<5-12,Barry>感觉很棒  你一定会喜欢的
<5-12,Barry>...it was really nice. You would've liked it.

125
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,630
<5-13,Rachel>我本来有穿胸罩
<5-13,Rachel>I had a bra.

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
<5-14,Bobby>嘿  范瑞柏大夫
<5-14,Bobby>Hey, Dr. Farber.

127
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,750
<5-15,Barry>你好  格林小姐  看来一切正常
<5-15,Barry>All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.

128
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,040
<5-15,Barry>你的牙齿看来整齐许多嘛
<5-15,Barry>We're starting to see some real progress.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,280
<5-15,Barry>-干嘛  -我12岁了  我不是傻子
<5-15,Barry>- What? - I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

130
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,690
<6-1,Chandler>能借用你的电话吗
<6-1,Chandler>Can I use your phone?

131
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,770
<6-2,Monica>我指点你一下  你拿的那支...
<6-2,Monica>For future reference, that thing in your hand...

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,950
<6-2,Monica>...也可以当电话使
<6-2,Monica>...can also be used as a phone.

133
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
<6-3,Chandler>这电话没问题啊
<6-3,Chandler>Yes, it's working.

134
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,710
<6-4,Joey>-她为何不回电  -或许她没听到你留言
<6-4,Joey>- Why isn't she calling? - Maybe she never got your message.

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,100
<6-5,Phoebe>如果愿意  你可以打给她的答录机
<6-5,Phoebe>If you want, you call her machine,

136
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,180
<6-5,Phoebe>如果听见许多哔声
<6-5,Phoebe>and if she has a lot of beeps...

137
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,970
<6-5,Phoebe>那代表她或许还没收留言
<6-5,Phoebe>...that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.

138
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,460
<6-6,Chandler>你不认为这样会使我有点
<6-6,Chandler>Doesn't that make me seem?

139
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,000
<6-7,Ross>绝望  迫切  可悲吗
<6-7,Ross>Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

140
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,620
<6-8,Chandler>你显然看过我的个人广告
<6-8,Chandler>You obviously saw my personal ad.

141
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,660
<6-9,Phoebe>哔几声
<6-9,Phoebe>How many beeps?

142
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,300
<6-10,Chandler>她接了
<6-10,Chandler>She answered.

143
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,690
<6-11,Monica>此时你该向她打招呼才对
<6-11,Monica>This is where you'd use that "hello" word.

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,570
<6-12,Chandler>我不能跟她讲话  她显然听到我的留言
<6-12,Chandler>I won't talk to her. She got my message...

145
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,650
<6-12,Chandler>而且选择不回电  我既迫切又被人冷落
<6-12,Chandler>...and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.

146
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,940
<6-12,Chandler>我真想念纯迫切的滋味
<6-12,Chandler>God, I miss just being needy.

147
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,520
<6-14,Phoebe>他接受了吗
<6-14,Phoebe>So how'd he take it?

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,320
<6-15,Rachel>事实上  还不错
<6-15,Rachel>Pretty well,actually.

149
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,740
<6-16,Monica>瑞秋  你头发上为何有牙线
<6-16,Monica>Rach. How come you have dental floss in your hair?

150
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,700
<6-17,Rachel>-有吗  -当然
<6-17,Rachel>- Oh, do l? - Uh, hmm.

151
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,320
<6-18,Monica>我们以在他椅子上做爱告终
<6-18,Monica>We ended up having sex in his chair.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,090
<6-19,Rachel>你们在他椅子上做爱
<6-19,Rachel>You had sex in his chair?

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,130
<6-20,Monica>我说得有点太大声了  是不是
<6-20,Monica>I said that a little too loudly, didn't l?

154
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,880
<6-21,Ross>你们做了什么
<6-21,Ross>You had what?

155
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,140
<6-22,Phoebe>在他椅子上做爱
<6-22,Phoebe>Sex in his chair.

156
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,570
<6-23,Ross>什么  你到底在想什么
<6-23,Ross>What...? What were you thinking?

157
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,190
<6-24,Rachel>我不知道  我们仍在乎对方
<6-24,Rachel>I don't know. We still care about each other.

158
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,820
<6-24,Rachel>我们曾相爱过  就像你和卡罗尔一样
<6-24,Rachel>There's a history there. It's like you and Carol.

159
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,060
<6-25,Ross>不  根本不像我和卡罗尔
<6-25,Ross>No, it's nothing like me and Carol.

160
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,840
<6-26,Rachel>得了吧  如果她说
<6-26,Rachel>Please. If she said to you,

161
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,840
<6-26,Rachel>"罗斯  我此时只想和你在这沙发上缠绵"
<6-26,Rachel>"Ross,I want you on this couch... right here, right now,"

162
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,450
<6-26,Rachel>你会怎么回答
<6-26,Rachel>what would you say?

163
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,160
<6-27,Chandler>如果能帮你思考  我可以过去点
<6-27,Chandler>If it helps, I could slide over.

164
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,940
<6-28,Ross>这完全是两回事  就像苹果和桔子
<6-28,Ross>It's a totally different situation. It's apples and oranges.

165
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,130
<6-28,Ross>是牙医和女同志的差别  我走了
<6-28,Ross>It's orthodontists and lesbians. I gotta go.

166
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,010
<6-29,Phoebe>-你要上哪儿去  -我就是要走  行吗
<6-29,Phoebe>- Where are you going? - I just have to go, all right?

167
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,470
<6-30,Ross>我需要理由吗  我有自己的人生要过
<6-30,Ross>Do I need a reason? I have things to do with my life.

168
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,070
<6-30,Ross>我有许多事要做
<6-30,Ross>I have a jam-packed schedule.

169
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,000
<6-30,Ross>我现在已经迟到了好吗
<6-30,Ross>And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?

170
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,060

<8-24,Mindy>他会像背叛瑞秋一样背叛你"
<8-24,Mindy>he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel,"
