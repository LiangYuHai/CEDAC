<1-1,Joey>How'd someone get a hold of your credit card number?

<1-3,Rachel>Monica, would you calm down?

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,090

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,010
<1-5,Ross>早就忘了要小心谨慎吧
<1-5,Ross>...they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.

9
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,180
<1-6,Chandler>真是个呆瓜  花了69.95元买"神奇拖把"

<1-11,Monica>Ross. You've got to do something about the humping.

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,590
<1-12,Ross>怎么了  这只是暂时的
<1-12,Ross>What? It's just a phase.

<1-14,Ross>你们冷静点行吗  这又没什么大不了
<1-14,Ross>Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,110
<1-15,Rachel>-马塞尔  停  坏猴子  -又怎么了
<1-15,Rachel>- Marcel, stop it. Marcel. Bad monkey. - What?

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,690
<1-15,Rachel>只能说  我的"好奇乔治"娃娃不再好奇了
<1-15,Rachel>Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,260
<2-1,Rachel>莫妮卡  你不是还在纠结吧
<2-1,Rachel>Monica, you are not still going over that thing.

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
<2-4,Monica>她买衣服的那家店

<2-5,Rachel>You're not an artist.

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,330
<2-6,Monica>要是有这些  我或许已是艺术家了
<2-6,Monica>I might be if I had the supplies.

<2-6,Monica>我本可以过这样的生活  我却没有
<2-6,Monica>I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,370
<6-6,Ross>她说马塞尔发情不是暂时的
<6-6,Ross>She says Marcel's humping thing is not a phase.

126
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,930
<6-6,Ross>显然他已性成熟了
<6-6,Ross>Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.

127
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,320
<6-7,Joey>哇  比你早哎
<6-7,Joey>Hey, he beat you.

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,780
<6-8,Ross>她说随着时间的推移
<6-8,Ross>She says, as time goes on,

129
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,550
<6-8,Ross>他会越来越暴力  侵略性越来越强
<6-8,Ross>he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.

130
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,310
<6-9,Chandler>这代表什么
<6-9,Chandler>So, what does this mean?

131
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,010
<6-10,Ross>我们不能再养他了
<6-10,Ross>I have to give him up.

132
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,170
<7-1,Joey>我真不敢相信  罗斯  这太扯了
<7-1,Joey>I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks.

133
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,070
<7-2,Chandler>我不懂  你也就刚养他
<7-2,Chandler>I don't get it, I mean, You just got him.

134
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,980
<7-2,Chandler>他怎会突然成熟了
<7-2,Chandler>How could he be an adult already?

135
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,570
<7-3,Ross>我知道  他曾经就是个小不点
<7-3,Ross>I know. One day he's this little thing...

136
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,120
<7-3,Ross>不知不觉中  这小不点抱住我大腿不撒手
<7-3,Ross>and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.

137
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,050
<7-4,Joey>你没什么办法继续养着他吗
<7-4,Joey>Isn't there any way to keep him?

138
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,500
<7-5,Ross>没有  兽医说除非有个地方
<7-5,Ross>No. The vet said that unless he's in a place...

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,340
<7-5,Ross>让他能通过正常渠道
<7-5,Ross>...where he has regular access...

140
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,200
<7-5,Ross>发展一些猴类之爱
<7-5,Ross>...to some monkey loving...

141
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,140
<7-5,Ross>否则他会越来越残暴
<7-5,Ross>... he's just gonna get vicious.

142
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,190
<7-5,Ross>我得将他送到动物园
<7-5,Ross>I just gotta get him into a zoo.

143
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,720
<7-6,Joey>-如何把一只猴送进动物园  -我知道
<7-6,Joey>- How do you get a monkey into a zoo? - I know that one.

144
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,670
<7-7,Chandler>不  那是如何让教皇进入大众汽车
<7-7,Chandler>No, that's popes into a Vokswagen.

145
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,030
<7-8,Ross>我们要多方申请
<7-8,Ross>We're applying to a lot of them.

146
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,890
<7-8,Ross>当然大型州立动物园是首选
<7-8,Ross>Our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos.

147
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,620
<7-8,Ross>比方说圣地亚哥动物园
<7-8,Ross>You know, like San Diego. Right?

148
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,310
<7-8,Ross>那可能只是痴人说梦
<7-8,Ross>But that may just be a pipe dream.

149
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,490
<7-8,Ross>因为他都不在州内
<7-8,Ross>Because you know, he's out-of-state.

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,060
<7-8,Ross>兽医说她有迈阿密的朋友  这是条路
<7-8,Ross>My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.

151
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,360
<7-9,Chandler>但那离海滩只有两个街区  环境太嘈杂
<7-9,Chandler>But that's two blocks from the beach. It's a total party zoo.

152
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,340
<7-10,Phoebe>-我们找到她了  找到偷卡女了  -什么
<7-10,Phoebe>- We found her, We found the girl. - What?

153
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,150
<7-12,Joey>你们报警了吗
<7-12,Joey>Did you call the cops?

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,080
<7-13,Rachel>没  我们和她一起吃了午餐
<7-13,Rachel>No, we took her to lunch.

155
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,390
<7-14,Chandler>用你们的方式给她治了罪
<7-14,Chandler>Oh, your own brand of vigilante justice.

156
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,490
<7-15,Ross>你疯了  那女人偷了你的东西
<7-15,Ross>Are you insane? This woman stole from you.

157
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,300
<7-15,Ross>她偷东西  她是个小偷
<7-15,Ross>She stole. She's a stealer.

158
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,970
<7-16,Monica>和这女人相处十分钟后
<7-16,Monica>After you're with this woman for like 10 minutes,

159
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,920
<7-16,Monica>你就会把这些全忘了
<7-16,Monica>you forget all that.

160
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,860
<7-16,Monica>她真是个振奋人心的奇女子
<7-16,Monica>I mean, she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit.

161
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,610
<7-17,Ross>是啊  指不定从某位啦啦队员那偷来的
<7-17,Ross>Yeah! Which she probably stole from some cheerleader.

162
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,610
<7-18,Chandler>-脱下他们的帽子  -教皇塞进大众车
<7-18,Chandler>- Take off their hats. - Popes in a Vokswagen.

164
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,880
<7-19,Phoebe>我喜欢这个笑话
<7-19,Phoebe>I love that joke.

165
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,620
<8-1,Rachel>不可能  你绝不会这么做
<8-1,Rachel>No way. No way did you do this.

166
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,120
<8-2,Fake Monica>莫娜娜相当勇敢
<8-2,Fake Monica>Monana was very brave.

167
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,770
<8-3,Monica>太疯狂了  我们自称是615房的冈德森姐妹
<8-3,Monica>It was so wild. We told them we were the Gundersons in room 615...

168
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,760
<8-3,Monica>结果波士顿凯尔特人队已包下整个六楼
<8-3,Monica>...only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire six floor.

169
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,990
<8-4,Fake Monica>当他们发现我们个子矮矮
<8-4,Fake Monica>So once they caught on to the fact that we're,

170
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,420
<8-4,Fake Monica>还是女人的那一刻
<8-4,Fake Monica>you know, short and have breasts...

171
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,980
<8-5,Monica>就把我们撵出来了  我居然被撵出饭店哎
<8-5,Monica>They threw us out. I was thrown out of a hotel. Me.

172
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,810
<8-6,Rachel>干得好  莫娜娜
<8-6,Rachel>Go, Monana.

173
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,550
<8-6,Rachel>不光你们过着梦想中的生活
<8-6,Rachel>You ladies are not the only ones living the dream.

174
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,150
<8-6,Rachel>我得去给陌生人倒咖啡了  不用等我
<8-6,Rachel>I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.

175
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,060
<8-7,Fake Monica>对了
<8-7,Fake Monica>Oh, by the way...

176
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,980
<8-7,Fake Monica>明天我们要去参加百老汇的面试
<8-7,Fake Monica>...tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.

177
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,860
<8-9,Fake Monica>-什么  -《猫》剧还有一个缺额
<8-9,Fake Monica>- Excuse me? - There's an open call for Cats.

178
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,880
<8-9,Fake Monica>我想我们可以去唱《回忆》
<8-9,Fake Monica>I'm thinking we go down there, sing "Memories"...

180
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,420
<8-9,Fake Monica>让自己大出洋相  你意下如何
<8-9,Fake Monica>...and make complete fools of ourselves. What do you say?

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,400
<8-10,Monica>不不不  记住你在跟谁说话呢
<8-10,Monica>No, no ,no. Remember who you're dealing with here.

182
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,430
<8-10,Monica>我不像你
<8-10,Monica>I mean, I'm not like you.

183
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,320
<8-10,Monica>我连站在踢踏舞教室前排都不敢
<8-10,Monica>I can't even stand in front of a tap class.

184
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,160
<8-11,Fake Monica>那可能是因为你的门诺教派背景
<8-11,Fake Monica>That's probably because of your Amish background.

185
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,510
<8-13,Fake Monica>-什么  -你不是德裔宾夕法尼亚州人吗
<8-13,Fake Monica>- What? - You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

186
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,780
<8-14,Monica>对  直到我买了吹风机  就被驱逐了
<8-14,Monica>Right. Till I bought a blow dryer. Then I was shunned.

188
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,850
<8-15,Fake Monica>我过去也和你一样
<8-15,Fake Monica>I used to be just like you.

189
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,110
<8-15,Fake Monica>直到有一天  我看了部改变我人生的电影
<8-15,Fake Monica>And then, one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.

190
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,360
<8-15,Fake Monica>你看过《死亡诗社》吗
<8-15,Fake Monica>Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?

191
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,390
<8-17,Fake Monica>我认为这电影实在是太...无聊了
<8-17,Fake Monica>I thought that movie was so incredibly boring.

192
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,180
<8-17,Fake Monica>那孩子在电影的结尾自杀了
<8-17,Fake Monica>I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself

193
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,020
<8-17,Fake Monica>只因他无法演出话剧
<8-17,Fake Monica>because he can't be in the play?

194
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,750
<8-17,Fake Monica>这是为了什么  不就是
<8-17,Fake Monica>What was that? It's like,

195
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,590
<8-17,Fake Monica>"孩子  再忍一年离开家
<8-17,Fake Monica>"Kid, wait a year. Leave home,

196
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,670
<8-17,Fake Monica>到社区话剧团去"
<8-17,Fake Monica>do some community theater."

197
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,330
<8-17,Fake Monica>走出电影院时我想
<8-17,Fake Monica>I walked out of there and I thought,

198
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,170
<8-17,Fake Monica>"花在这部烂片上的两个小时再也回不来了"
<8-17,Fake Monica>"Now that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back."

199
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,380
<8-17,Fake Monica>这想法震惊了我
<8-17,Fake Monica>And that thought scared me

200
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,280
<8-17,Fake Monica>从此便不再惧怕尝试任何事了
<8-17,Fake Monica>more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.

201
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,570
<8-18,Monica>那我强烈建议你别看《窈窕奶爸》
<8-18,Monica>Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

203
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,500
<8-18,Monica>上帝
<8-18,Monica>Oh, God.

204
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,170
<9-1,Ross>我们进不了斯克兰顿了
<9-1,Ross>We didn't get into Scranton.

205
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,930
<9-1,Ross>那是我们保底的动物园
<9-1,Ross>That was, like, our safety zoo.

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,260
<9-1,Ross>他们连狗和牛都收
<9-1,Ross>They take, like, dogs and cows.

207
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,330
<9-1,Ross>我真不明白  我和他谁更难受一点
<9-1,Ross>See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.

208
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,860
<9-2,Phoebe>我想那椅子首当其冲
<9-2,Phoebe>I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.

209
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,150
<9-3,Ross>马塞尔  马塞尔  马塞尔  不要
<9-3,Ross>Marcel. Marcel. Marcel, no.

210
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,330
<9-3,Ross>乖宝  怎么会没人要他
<9-3,Ross>Good boy. See? How can nobody want him?

211
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,590
<9-4,Rachel>一定会有人的
<9-4,Rachel>Somebody will.

212
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,130
<9-5,Joey>你知道吗  早就有人叫乔瑟夫·斯大林了
<9-5,Joey>You know, there already is a Joseph Stalin.

213
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,850
<9-6,Chandler>开什么玩笑
<9-6,Chandler>You're kidding.

214
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,630
<9-7,Joey>显然他是个嗜血如命的俄国独裁者
<9-7,Joey>Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people.

215
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,480
<9-7,Joey>我还以为你考虑得挺周全呢
<9-7,Joey>You'd think you would've known that.

216
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,360
<9-8,Chandler>那是你想错了
<9-8,Chandler>You'd think I would've.

217
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,390
<9-9,Joey>菲比  你认为我该取什么艺名登台
<9-9,Joey>Phoebe. What do you think a good stage name for me would be?

218
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,090
<9-10,Phoebe>火焰男孩
<9-10,Phoebe>Flame Boy.

219
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,460
<10-1,Ross>你的动物园具体在哪
<10-1,Ross>Where exactly is your zoo?

220
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,120
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>严格而言  不算是个动物园
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>Well, it's technically not a zoo, per se.

221
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,930
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>更像是种互动式野外体验
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.

222
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,230
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>-我想请教你几个关于马塞尔的问题  -好
<10-2,Dr. Baldhara>- Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel. - Yes.

223
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,390
<10-4,Dr. Baldhara>他会和其他动物打架吗
<10-4,Dr. Baldhara>Does he, uh, fight with other animals?

224
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,140
<10-5,Ross>不会的  他非常温驯
<10-5,Ross>No, no. He's very docile.

225
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,210
<10-6,Dr. Baldhara>就算被逼进角落也不会吗
<10-6,Dr. Baldhara>Even if he were cornered?

226
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,860
<10-7,Ross>我不知道  干嘛这么问
<10-7,Ross>Well, I don't know. Why?

227
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,290
<10-8,Dr. Baldhara>他掌控小东西的能力如何
<10-8,Dr. Baldhara>How is he at handling small objects?

228
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,180
<10-9,Ross>他会拿香蕉  如果你是这意思的话
<10-9,Ross>He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.

229
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,500
<10-10,Dr. Baldhara>锤子或小刀呢
<10-10,Dr. Baldhara>What about a hammer or a small blade?

230
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,330
<10-11,Ross>他为何需要小刀
<10-11,Ross>Why would he need a blade?

231
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,650
<10-12,Dr. Baldhara>如果他要对抗的是狸猫或有角的动物
<10-12,Dr. Baldhara>Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns,
