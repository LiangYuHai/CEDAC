11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,540
<1-14,Chandler>最重要的是

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,500
<1-14,Chandler>我棒吗
<1-14,Chandler>...was I any good?

<1-15,Rachel>Well, you were pretty damn good.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,460
<1-16,Chandler>真有意思  在我梦中我非常力不从心
<1-16,Chandler>Interesting. Cause in my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,220
<1-17,Rachel>昨晚你在这桌上的表现完美无缺
<1-17,Rachel>Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.

<1-20,Ross>I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.

19
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,240
<1-21,Chandler>抱歉  仅此一次
<1-21,Chandler>I'm sorry, it was a one-time thing.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,000
<1-21,Chandler>我醉得不省人事  而且这不是我的潜意识
<1-21,Chandler>I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.

36

<2-1,Chandler>你好呀  瑞秋

<2-5,Ross>菲比  你为何想操作钻床
<2-5,Ross>Phoebe, why would you want to operate a drill press?

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,850
<2-6,Phoebe>只是暂时的工作
<2-6,Phoebe>Just for some short-term-work.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,420
<2-6,Phoebe>直到我找回一部分前按摩客户

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,430
<2-8,Phoebe>结果他们就不来了
<2-8,Phoebe>And they are.

48
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,820
<2-9,Joey>嗨  钱德勒  她可以为你工作

140
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,610

<5-18,Phoebe>But then you got promoted, and, you know,

<5-20,Phoebe>- I can't believe it. - Yeah. They even do you.

144
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,110
<5-21,Chandler>模仿我
<5-21,Chandler>They "do" me?

145

<5-23,Chandler>-我没有那样说话  -你有的
<5-23,Chandler>- I don't sound like that. - Yeah, you do.

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,290
<5-25,Joey>这山谷回荡着美妙的
<5-25,Joey>"The hills are alive with the sound...

<5-28,Chandler>我没那样说话  这绝"不"是真的
<5-28,Chandler>I don't sound like that. That is so not true.

152
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,430
<5-29,Chandler>"不"是这样  "不"是这样
<5-29,Chandler>That is so not... That is so not...

00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,980
<5-29,Chandler>这 闭嘴吧
<5-29,Chandler>That Oh, shut up.

154
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,000
<6-2,Young Ethan>-不会吧  -告诉你  我到九岁时
<6-2,Young Ethan>- Did not. - I'm telling you, up until I was 9...

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,400
<6-2,Young Ethan>还以为"枪口"就是真实存在的犯罪现场
<6-2,Young Ethan>... I thought "gunpoint" was an actual place where crimes happened.

156
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,770
<6-4,Young Ethan>-怎么会  -新闻老是报导犯罪事件
<6-4,Young Ethan>- How's that possible? - Well, think about it. It's always on the news.

157
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,570
<6-4,Young Ethan>某人在"枪口"下
<6-4,Young Ethan>"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

158
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,540
<6-4,Young Ethan>惊慌的观光客在"枪口"下
<6-4,Young Ethan>"Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint."

159
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,360
<6-4,Young Ethan>我一直在想  怎么还有人去那儿
<6-4,Young Ethan>And I kept thinking, "Why do people continue to go there?"

160
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,830
<6-6,Young Ethan>-我该走了  -好
<6-6,Young Ethan>- I should go. - Ok.

161
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,960
<6-7,Monica>-除非  -什么
<6-7,Monica>- Unless. - What?

162
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,840
<6-9,Monica>除非你要在这儿过夜
<6-9,Monica>Unless you wanna stay over.

163
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,390
<6-9,Monica>我反正要在这过夜  不如
<6-9,Monica>I mean, I'm going to. So....

164
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,340
<6-10,Young Ethan>是啊  这样再好不过
<6-10,Young Ethan>Yeah, I'd really like that.

165
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,250
<6-11,Young Ethan>在我们考虑留宿的事宜之前
<6-11,Young Ethan>Before we get into any staying-over stuff...

166
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,350
<6-11,Young Ethan>我有些事情必须告诉你
<6-11,Young Ethan>...there's something you should know.

167
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,990
<6-12,Monica>是"我明天一早有课"之类的
<6-12,Monica>Ok. Is this, like, "I have an early class tomorrow"...

168
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,860
<6-12,Monica>还是"我与山羊秘密结婚了"
<6-12,Monica>...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?

169
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,200
<6-13,Young Ethan>在这两者之间
<6-13,Young Ethan>Well, it's somewhere in between.

170
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,570
<6-13,Young Ethan>就严格技术层面而言  当然  我还没
<6-13,Young Ethan>You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not....

171
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,690
<6-13,Young Ethan>我是说  我还没有
<6-13,Young Ethan>Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

172
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,790
<6-14,Monica>-伊森  -在
<6-14,Monica>- Ethan? - Yeah.

173
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,530
<6-16,Monica>你是处男吗
<6-16,Monica>Are you a virgin?

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,840
<6-17,Young Ethan>如果你们这些孩子现在这样称呼的话
<6-17,Young Ethan>If that's what you kids are calling it these days, then...

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,170
<6-17,Young Ethan>对  我是个处男
<6-17,Young Ethan>...yes, I am.

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,410
<6-17,Young Ethan>我大概一直在等待适合的人
<6-17,Young Ethan>I've kind of been waiting for the right person.

177
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,410
<6-18,Monica>-真的吗  -真的
<6-18,Monica>- Really? - Yeah.

178
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,190
<6-19,Young Ethan>你知道我是在指你吧
<6-19,Young Ethan>You do know I was talking about you, right?

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
<6-21,Monica>你一直喔个不停
<6-21,Monica>You keep saying that.

180
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,460
<6-22,Young Ethan>你懂的  你在杂志上看过  在电影里看过
<6-22,Young Ethan>You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies.

181
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,920
<6-22,Young Ethan>甚至在家里练习过  可是天啊
<6-22,Young Ethan>Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man...

182
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,260
<6-22,Young Ethan>这感觉实在没得比
<6-22,Young Ethan>...it is nothing like that.

183
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,130
<6-22,Young Ethan>听着  听着
<6-22,Young Ethan>Listen, listen.

184
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,020
<6-23,Monica>你对我坦白了一件难以启齿的事
<6-23,Monica>You told me something that was really difficult for you.

185
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,140
<6-23,Monica>我想如果你能坦诚相对  那我也能
<6-23,Monica>And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.

186
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,810
<6-24,Young Ethan>天啊  别告诉我刚才做错了
<6-24,Young Ethan>Oh, God. Don't tell me I did it wrong.

187
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,230
<6-25,Monica>不  那件事你做得非常完美
<6-25,Monica>No, no, no. Nothing wrong about that.

188
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,120
<6-26,Young Ethan>好  我说了
<6-26,Young Ethan>Ok, Here goes.

189
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,410
<6-27,Monica>我不是22岁
<6-27,Monica>I'm not 22.

<6-27,Monica>...and 13 months.

192
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,390
<6-29,Monica>但是我想  我们的关系不会因此变掉
<6-29,Monica>But I figure, you know, that shouldn't change anything.

193
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,700
<6-29,Monica>年龄根本就不是距离对吧
<6-29,Monica>I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are?

194
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,140
<6-29,Monica>听着
<6-29,Monica>Listen...

195
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,340
<6-30,Young Ethan>在你坦承之际
<6-30,Young Ethan>...as long as we're telling stuff...

196
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,960
<6-30,Young Ethan>我也有话要说
<6-30,Young Ethan>... I have another one for you.

197
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,870
<6-30,Young Ethan>我比你所知的年纪还小
<6-30,Young Ethan>I'm a little younger than I said.

198
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,960
<6-31,Monica>-你不是四年级生吗  -我是四年级
<6-31,Monica>- You're not a senior? - Oh, I'm a senior...

<6-32,Young Ethan>高中四年级
<6-32,Young Ethan>...in high school.

200
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,570
<7-1,Monica>我们不应该这样
<7-1,Monica>What we did was wrong.

201
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,110
<7-2,Young Ethan>天啊  我刚和一个

205
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,970
<7-3,Monica>伊森  注意听  你为何不早告诉我
<7-3,Monica>Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

206
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,820
<7-4,Young Ethan>-你也没告诉我你真实年龄  -那不一样
<7-4,Young Ethan>- You never tell me how old you are. - It's different.

207
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,440
<7-5,Monica>我撒的谎不会让我们在48个州获重罪
<7-5,Monica>My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.

209
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,890
<7-6,Young Ethan>-你到底在想什么  -我什么都没想
<7-6,Young Ethan>- What were you thinking? - I wasn't thinking.

<7-11,Monica>Well, fall out of it.

214
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,660
<7-11,Monica>你都不该在这  你该在学校过夜的
<7-11,Monica>You shouldn't be here. It's a school night.

215
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,020
<7-11,Monica>天啊

226
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,910
<8-4,Chandler>为什么  难道是梦中的我对你过于粗鲁
<8-4,Chandler>Why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy?
