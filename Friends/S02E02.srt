<6-41,MONICA>等等  我们只做了一次
<6-41,MONICA>Wait, we only did it once.

186
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,690
<6-41,MONICA>对我没有任何意义
<6-41,MONICA>It didn't meant anything to me.

187
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,060
<6-42,RACHEL>好吧
<6-42,RACHEL>Right. Sure.

<6-49,MONICA>No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.

203
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,070
<6-50,CAROL>情况如何
<6-50,CAROL>How did we do?

204
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,030
<6-51,PHOEBE>我尝了本的奶  罗斯就发火了
<6-51,PHOEBE>I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.

205
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,300
<6-52,ROSS>我没有发火
<6-52,ROSS>I did not freak out.

206
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,850
<6-53,CAROL>-你为什么发火  -因为那是母乳
<6-53,CAROL>- Why'd you freak out? - Because it's breast milk.

207
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,720
<6-54,ROSS>很呕心
<6-54,ROSS>It's gross.

208
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,060
<6-55,CAROL>我的奶水很呕心

<6-57,ROSS>这没什么不对
<6-57,ROSS>No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.

211
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,980
<6-57,ROSS>我只是不认为母乳是给大人喝的
<6-57,ROSS>I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

212
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,980
<6-58,CHANDLER>当然装母乳的容器很吸引大人与小孩
<6-58,CHANDLER>Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.

213
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,280
<6-59,CAROL>罗斯  别傻了  我试过  没什么
<6-59,CAROL>Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal.

<6-60,ROSS>不行
<6-60,ROSS>That would be no.

216
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,310
<6-61,PHOEBE>-尝尝吧  很天然  -试试  -不
<6-61,PHOEBE>- Come on. It's natural. - Try it. - No.

217
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,630
<6-61,PHOEBE>又不难吃
<6-61,PHOEBE>It doesn't taste bad.

218
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,270
<6-46,RACHEL>有一点甜  很像...
<6-46,RACHEL>Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like....

219
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,930
<6-63,SUSAN>-像什么  -哈密瓜汁
<6-63,SUSAN>- Like what? - Cantaloupe juice.

220
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,910
<6-64,JOEY>没错

221
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,650
<6-65,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-65,ROSS>You've tasted it.

222
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,600
<6-65,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-65,ROSS>You've tasted it.

223
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,960
<6-67,ROSS>你尝过了
<6-67,ROSS>Oh, you've tasted it.

224
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,770
<6-68,SUSAN>你再怎么重复这句话  也不会改变事实
<6-68,SUSAN>You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

225
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,370
<6-69,ROSS>把奶瓶给我
<6-69,ROSS>Give me the bottle.

226
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,640
<6-69,ROSS>把毛巾给我
<6-69,ROSS>Get me the towel.

227
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,920
<6-70,CHANDLER>你好

<6-71,JOEY>给我一盒果汁
<6-71,JOEY>Give me a box of juice.

229
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,170
<6-71,JOEY>他们把我调到原野奇侠了
<6-71,JOEY>Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

230
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,780
<6-72,CHANDLER>也许是因为你的穿着
<6-72,CHANDLER>Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

231
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,300
<6-73,JOEY>或因为那家伙表现太好了
