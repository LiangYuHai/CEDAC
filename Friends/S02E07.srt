<10-7,PHOE>-然后呢  -我们做了
<10-7,PHOE>- And? - And we did.

<10-8,JOEY>不错啊  菲比  好样的
<10-8,JOEY>All right, Phoebs, way to go

272
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,160
<10-9,PHOE>我好棒
<10-9,PHOE>Yea,me!

273
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,090
<10-10,JOEY>怎么发生的
<10-10,JOEY>So how did it happen?

274
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,480
<10-11,PHOE>我听了你的建议  问他到底怎么回事
<10-11,PHOE>Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.

275
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,330
<10-12,JOEY>那他说什么
<10-12,JOEY>What did he say?

276
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,640
<10-13,PHOE>他能理解性对女人而言
<10-13,PHOE>He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like,

277
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,870
<10-13,PHOE>可能会引起情绪波动
<10-13,PHOE>a very emotional thing for a woman

278
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,950
<10-13,PHOE>他只是怕我会开始胡思乱想
<10-13,PHOE>And he was just afraid that I was going to get all:

279
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,630
<10-13,PHOE>"他第二天会联系我吗"和"我们会有结果吗"
<10-13,PHOE>"Is he gonna call me the next day?" and "Where is this going?"

280
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,650
<10-13,PHOE>所以他说他想等他准备开始认真了再说
<10-13,PHOE>So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.

281
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,520
<10-15,PHOE>所以我说"尽管放轻松"
<10-15,PHOE>So I said,"Okay. Relax,please."

282
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,990
<10-15,PHOE>性可以只是两个人一时的感觉
<10-15,PHOE>I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.

283
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,010
<10-15,PHOE>他要想再见我  可以打电话给我  不想也没关系
<10-15,PHOE>If he wants to see me again,he can call. If not,that's fine too.

284
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,980
<10-15,PHOE>所以在长谈之后
<10-15,PHOE>So after a lot of talking...

285
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,090
<10-15,PHOE>我说服他了
<10-15,PHOE>... I convinced him.

286
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,790
<10-16,JOEY>让我先搞清楚
<10-16,JOEY>Let me get this straight.

287
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,910
<10-16,JOEY>他让你求他跟你上床
<10-16,JOEY>He got you to beg to sleep with him.

288
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,750
<10-16,JOEY>他让你主动说  他永远不用再打电话给你
<10-16,JOEY>He got you to say he never has to call you again.

289
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,060
<10-16,JOEY>而且还让你觉得这是个好主意
<10-16,JOEY>And he got you thinking this is a great idea?

290
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,840
<10-18,JOEY>我对他佩服得五体投地
<10-18,JOEY>This man is my god!

291
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,130
<11-2,ROSS>我没有领养猫
<11-2,ROSS>I didn't get a cat.

292
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,880
<11-3,RACH>真有趣
<11-3,RACH>That's interesting.

293
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,020
<11-4,ROSS>不  一点都不有趣  非常非常不有趣
<11-4,ROSS>No, no, it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting.

294
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,300
<11-4,ROSS>百分之百不有趣  瑞秋
<11-4,ROSS>In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.

295
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,350
<11-5,RACH>好  我懂了  罗斯
<11-5,RACH>Alright, I got it Ross.

296
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,690
<11-6,ROSS>你没有权利告诉我说  你喜欢过我
<11-6,ROSS>You had no right to say you ever had feelings for me.

297
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,660
<11-7,RACH>什么
<11-7,RACH>What?

298
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,290
<11-8,ROSS>在我发现之前  我跟朱莉过得很快乐
<11-8,ROSS>I was doing great with Julie before I found that about you!

299
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,690
<11-8,ROSS>在我发现之前  我也过得很快乐
<11-8,ROSS>I was doing great before I found that about you!

300
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,000
<11-9,RACH>你以为看你跟朱莉那样  我心里好受吗
<11-9,RACH>You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

301
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,390
<11-10,ROSS>你应该在我认识她之前说出来
<11-10,ROSS>You should've said something before I met her!

302
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,960
<11-11,RACH>那时我不知道  那你为什么从没对我表白
<11-11,RACH>I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me?

303
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,590
<11-12,ROSS>我从来没机会说出口
<11-12,ROSS>There was never a good time.

304
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,180
<11-13,RACH>对  你只有一年机会  况且我们每晚都在一起
<11-13,RACH>Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.

305
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,730
<11-13,RACH>不是
<11-13,RACH>Not...

307
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,020

<11-14,ROSS>You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel,

308
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,840
<11-14,ROSS>但每次都有状况发生
<11-14,ROSS>but things got in the way, y'know?

309
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480

<11-15,RACH>There was one Italian guy,okay? And do you have a point?

313
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,760
<11-16,ROSS>重点是  我现在已经不需要这样了
<11-16,ROSS>The point is,I don't need this right now!

<12-11,CHAN>And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

338
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,810
<12-12,MNCA>是没有  但是我...
<12-12,MNCA>Well,no. But I....

339
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,080
<12-13,CHAN>换做是我的话  我都没有动力下床了
<12-13,CHAN>If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,350
<12-14,MNCA>我努力保持乐观
<12-14,MNCA>You know,I try to stay positive.

341
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,470
<12-14,MNCA>那你...
<12-14,MNCA>So you....

342
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,430
<12-15,CHAN>你想出去跑会儿步吗
<12-15,CHAN>You feel like going for a run?

343
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,770
<12-16,MNCA>好吧
<12-16,MNCA>All right.

344
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,970
<12-17,CHAN>你不一定要去跑的  你可以在这里睡一下
<12-17,CHAN>Because you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.

345
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,170
<12-18,MNCA>-好  只睡一小会儿 -好
<12-18,MNCA>- OK. Just for a little while - Okey.
