5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,340

<1-10,MONICA>Money is so impersonal.

10

<1-22,ROSS>除非横十四的"格什温音乐剧"
<1-22,ROSS>unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,660
<1-22,ROSS>是叫"咬我  咬我  咬我"
<1-22,ROSS>...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me."

45
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,460
<2-1,JOEY>真不敢相信这就到圣诞节了
<2-1,JOEY>I can't believe it's Christmas already.

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,010
<2-1,JOEY>我们才刚吃完了感恩火鸡  一转眼
<2-1,JOEY>One day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know...

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,280
<2-1,JOEY>就该唱"跳跃的男人"和"生蛋的鹅"了
<2-1,JOEY>your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

49
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,090
<2-2,CHANDLER>所以每年这个时候  鹅才会感到如释重负
<2-2,CHANDLER>Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>那是你妈的主意
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>It was your mother's idea.

126
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,550
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>她不想让你知道谁是你爸
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>She didn't want you to know your real father...

127
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,590
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>因为他的离开把你妈的心给伤透了
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>... because he hurt her so much when he left.

128
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,540
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>我也不想跟着骗你
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>I didn't want to go wrong with her.

129
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,190
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>可是她死了  那样跟她争就更难了
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.

130
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,120
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>不是不可能  只是更难
<3-16,GRANDMOTHER>Not impossible, but harder.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,060
<3-17,PHOEBE>那他就不是一个有名的树医
<3-17,PHOEBE>All right. So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

132
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,620
<3-17,PHOEBE>他也不住在没有电话的缅甸茅屋里头
<3-17,PHOEBE>And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

133
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,790
<3-18,GRANDMOTHER>我听说他在纽约州某个地方当药剂师
<3-18,GRANDMOTHER>Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,750
<3-19,PHOEBE>那没有道理
<3-19,PHOEBE>That makes no sense.

135
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,140
<3-19,PHOEBE>村民们为什么要崇拜一个药剂师呢
<3-19,PHOEBE>Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

136
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,010
<3-20,GRANDMOTHER>亲爱的
<3-20,GRANDMOTHER>Honey.

137
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,080
<3-21,PHOEBE>反正我所知道的就这么多
<3-21,PHOEBE>Anyway, that's all I know.

138
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,070
<3-21,PHOEBE>还有
<3-21,PHOEBE>That...

139
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,420
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>这个
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>...and this.

140
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,110
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>这
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>This...

141
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>是他本人
<3-22,GRANDMOTHER>...is the real him.

142
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,410
<4-1,CHANDLER>我记得我爸爸  他穿了一身火红的衣服
<4-1,CHANDLER>I remember my father all dressed up in the red suit...

143
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,950
<4-1,CHANDLER>黑色的大靴子  还有漆皮皮带
<4-1,CHANDLER>...the big black boots and the patent leather belt...

144
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,990
<4-1,CHANDLER>在楼下鬼鬼崇崇的  他不想被任何人发现
<4-1,CHANDLER>...sneaking around downstairs. He didn't want us to see him...

145
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,470
<4-1,CHANDLER>可是他醉得东倒西歪
<4-1,CHANDLER>but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble,

146
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,790
<4-1,CHANDLER>然后撞东撞西  把大家都吵醒
<4-1,CHANDLER>crash into something and wake everybody up.

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,480
<4-2,RACHEL>听起来不像是个快乐的圣诞节
<4-2,RACHEL>That doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

148
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,530
<4-3,CHANDLER>谁说起圣诞节了
<4-3,CHANDLER>Who said anything about Christmas?

149
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,230
<4-5,ROSS>有没有菲比的消息
<4-5,ROSS>Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

150
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,340
<4-6,RACHEL>没有
<4-6,RACHEL>No, nothing.

151
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,960
<4-7,MONICA>希望她没事
<4-7,MONICA>I hope she's okay.

152
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,620
<4-8,JOEY>是啊  我清楚知道她的处境
<4-8,JOEY>Yeah. I know exactly what she's going through.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,020
<4-9,MONICA>你怎么会清楚知道她的处境
<4-9,MONICA>How do you know exactly what she's going through?

154
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,770
<4-10,JOEY>她告诉我们的
<4-10,JOEY>She told us.

155
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,340
<4-11,CHANDLER>摩妮卡  你买了什么
<4-11,CHANDLER>What do you got there, Monica?

156
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,350
<4-12,MONICA>派对要用的东西
<4-12,MONICA>Just some stuff for the party.

157
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,250
<4-13,ROSS>你们还在这里干什么  你们不是该去买礼物了吗
<4-13,ROSS>What are you guys doing here?Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

158
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,300
<4-14,MONICA>你们礼物还没买好吗
<4-14,MONICA>You didn't buy presents yet?

159
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,580
<4-14,MONICA>明天就是平安夜了  你们要怎么办
<4-14,MONICA>Tomorrow's Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

160
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,840
<4-15,CHANDLER>不是黏土动画里面的人才会那么说的吗
<4-15,CHANDLER>Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

161
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,220
<4-16,RACHEL>对了  摩妮卡  我想邮差不喜欢你的饼干
<4-16,RACHEL>Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies.

162
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,070
<4-16,RACHEL>这是你妈寄来的装饰品
<4-16,RACHEL>Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

163
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,780
<4-17,MONICA>说不定他喜欢我的饼干  只是嫌少了
<4-17,MONICA>Maybe the mailman liked the cookies. We just didn't give him enough.

164
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,110
<4-18,JOEY>摩妮卡  鸽子的觉悟都比你高
<4-18,JOEY>Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

165
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,190
<4-19,ROSS>瑞秋

<4-19,ROSS>你也写张关于我的列表怎么样
<4-19,ROSS>How about you make a list about me?

168

<4-20,RACHEL>Forget it. Ross. I'm not gonna stand here....and make a list

169
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,720
<4-21,ROSS>好  你爱发牢骚
<4-21,ROSS>Okay, you're whiny...

170
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,630
<4-22,RACHEL>没完没了  疑神疑鬼
<4-22,RACHEL>...you are obsessive, you are insecure...

171
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,190
<4-22,RACHEL>没有胆量
<4-22,RACHEL>...you're gutless.

172
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,660
<4-22,RACHEL>你从来不知道怎么"把握时机"
<4-22,RACHEL>You don't ever just "seize the day."

173
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,660
<4-22,RACHEL>你暗恋我一年了吧  结果你一直憋在心里
<4-22,RACHEL>You liked me for a year and you didn't do anything about it.

174
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,420
<4-22,RACHEL>还有  你头发涂了太多发胶了
<4-22,RACHEL>And you wear too much of that gel in your hair.

183
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,650
<5-1,PHOEBE>好吧  你知道吗  你没有资格自称查号台
<5-1,PHOEBE>You know what? You shouldn't call yourself Information!

184

<5-3,PHOEBE>外婆  如果这是你真名的话

<5-4,GRANDMOTHER>-查得怎么样了  -不太好
<5-4,GRANDMOTHER>- How's it going? - Not so good.

187
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,790
<5-5,PHOEBE>纽约州那么大  他那么渺小  你自己算算
<5-5,PHOEBE>Upstate's pretty big. He's pretty small. You do the math.

188
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,840
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>我觉得你还是别找了
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>Well, I think you're better off without him.

189
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,750
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>我知道他是你爸
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,770
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>但是对我而言  他是个不负责任的混球
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep...

191
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,540
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>让你妈怀孕  又偷她的车子
<5-6,GRANDMOTHER>...who locked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

<5-8,GRANDMOTHER>I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that,

195
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,040
<5-8,GRANDMOTHER>其实是骗你的
<5-8,GRANDMOTHER>uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.

196
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,030

198
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,680
<5-10,GRANDMOTHER>看到"冰雪皇后"就说明过头了
<5-10,GRANDMOTHER>If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.

199
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,970
<5-10,GRANDMOTHER>开我的车去吧
<5-10,GRANDMOTHER>You can take my cab.

<10-9,PHOEBE>... because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.

335
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,720
<10-10,CHANDLER>那怎么不去敲门
<10-10,CHANDLER>So why not go knock?

336
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,470
<10-11,PHOEBE>因为如果他不够做父亲的资格呢
<10-11,PHOEBE>Because, I mean, what if he's not this great-dad guy?

337
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,330
<10-11,PHOEBE>如果他还是那个抛妻弃女的浑球呢
<10-11,PHOEBE>What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?

338
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,500
<10-11,PHOEBE>你知道吗
<10-11,PHOEBE>You know what?

<10-11,PHOEBE>我不想再失去一个真的爸爸
<10-11,PHOEBE>I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

341
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,440

<10-14,CHANDLER>哪天你准备好了  就会主动去认他了
<10-14,CHANDLER>Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

343
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,330
<10-15,JOEY>到那个时候  他认你这个女儿  会感到很幸运
<10-15,JOEY>And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

344
