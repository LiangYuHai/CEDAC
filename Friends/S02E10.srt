<2-34,RACH>可这里有五个空瓶
<2-34,RACH>And yet somehow we went through five?

91
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,070
<2-37,MNCA>那又怎么样  他今晚喝多了
<2-37,MNCA>So what? So he drank a lot tonight.

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,250
<2-38,ROSS>没错  不过现在回想起来
<2-38,ROSS>Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it,

93
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,670
<2-38,ROSS>我觉得风趣鲍比酒不离手
<2-38,ROSS>I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.

94
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,600
<2-39,PHOE>你们有没有注意过  他故事开头总是
<2-39,PHOE>Yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with,

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,910
<2-39,PHOE>"我喝得烂醉了"  或是"我们快喝趴下了"
<2-39,PHOE>... "Okay, I was so wasted!" or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

96
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,030
<2-39,PHOE>"我醒来后发现我在康州一辆清道车里面"
<2-39,PHOE>"So I wake up and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut!"

97
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,540
<2-40,JOEY>摩妮卡  你们在一起时  他哪次没喝酒的
<2-40,JOEY>Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,760
<2-41,MNCA>只是恰巧而已  我们去的地方都会喝酒的
<2-41,MNCA>We just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,290
<2-41,MNCA>我们去品酒会  怎么可能不来杯酒
<2-41,MNCA>How do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,280
<2-41,MNCA>要不就是去俱乐部  或是...
<2-41,MNCA>Or to a club, or to the...

101
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,240
<2-41,MNCA>动物园

<3-2,RACH>不知道  你尝尝看吧
<3-2,RACH>I don't know, want you to taste it.

<3-5,FBOB>我们把这些都调成爱尔兰咖啡怎么样
<3-5,FBOB>What do you say we make these coffees Irish?

<3-7,RACH>Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

110
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,580
<3-8,MNCA>你最近好像把很多东西都做成爱尔兰式的
<3-8,MNCA>It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff "lrish" lately.

111
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,330
<3-9,FBOB>我很想弄成比利时式的  可饼干很难塞进酒瓶子里
<3-9,FBOB>I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

112
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,840
<3-10,MNCA>-鲍比  -好吧
<3-10,MNCA>- Bobby.  - Yeah, okay.

113
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,270
<3-11,FBOB>听着  这或许不关我的事  或许有关  我不知道
<3-11,FBOB>Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know...

114
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,220
<3-12,MNCA>我有点担心你
<3-12,MNCA>but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,030
<3-13,FBOB>这不是第一次有人跟我说这事了
<3-13,FBOB>OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this,

116
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,470
<3-13,FBOB>我老是为我自己找一些借口
<3-13,FBOB>but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like...

117
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,830
<3-13,FBOB>像是"我是为了应酬"
<3-13,FBOB>'I'm just a social drinker,'

118
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,660
<3-13,FBOB>或"喝吧  今天是国旗日"
<3-13,FBOB>Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

120
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,230
<3-14,MNCA>那你现在用什么借口呢
<3-14,MNCA>So, what are you saying now?

121
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,360
<3-15,FBOB>我要说
<3-15,FBOB>I guess I'm saying...

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,980
<3-15,FBOB>我戒戒看
<3-15,FBOB>... I'll try and quit.

123
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,510
<3-15,FBOB>我喜欢你担心我的样子

<7-3,CHAN>I'm guessing you didn't get the part...

280
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,140
<7-3,CHAN>还是意大利来电说它饿了
<7-3,CHAN>...or Italy called and said it was hungry?

281
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,570

<7-10,JOEY>我可以跟她上床
<7-10,JOEY>I guess I could sleep with her. I mean....

290
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,540
<7-10,JOEY>我怎么能那么做呢
<7-10,JOEY>How can I do that?

291
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,630
<7-11,CHAN>我有一本教我一切性知识的立体书
<7-11,CHAN>I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.

292
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,490
<7-12,JOEY>我从没有为了角色跟人上床过
<7-12,JOEY>I've never slept with someone for a part.

293
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,870
<7-13,CHAN>那她...
<7-13,CHAN>Well, is she

294
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,960
<7-14,JOEY>抱歉
<7-14,JOEY>Sorry.

295
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,640
<7-15,CHAN>她长得好看吗
<7-15,CHAN>Is she good-looking?

<7-16,JOEY>好看  她长得非常好看
<7-16,JOEY>Yeah, she's totally good looking.

297
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,770
<7-16,JOEY>我在酒吧认识她的话  一定会请她吃早餐
<7-16,JOEY>I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.

298
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,250
<7-16,JOEY>我是说跟她上床之后
<7-16,JOEY>You know, after having slept with her.

299
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,970
<7-17,CHAN>或许这没什么大不了的
<7-17,CHAN>Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know,

300
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,720
<7-17,CHAN>依我看  你不但得到一份好工作  还可以跟她上床
<7-17,CHAN>The way that I see it is, you get a great job, and you get to have sex!

301
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,070
<7-17,CHAN>你这也算是事业美女双丰收了
<7-17,CHAN>Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.

302
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,550
<7-18,JOEY>我只是不希望走这条捷径
<7-18,JOEY>I just don't think that I want it that way, though.

303
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,270
<7-18,JOEY>假如哪天我真成名了
<7-18,JOEY>I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?

304
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,750
<7-18,JOEY>我会怀疑当初到底是因为我的才华
<7-18,JOEY>I'll always look back and wonder if it was because of my talent

305
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,680
<7-18,JOEY>还是因为我的"小将军"
<7-18,JOEY>or because of you know, the little general.

306
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,970
<7-19,CHAN>你以前不是叫它"小少校"的吗
<7-19,CHAN>Didn't you use to call it "the little major"?

307
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,240
<7-20,JOEY>对  但上过丹尼斯·迪马克后  它就晋升了
<7-20,JOEY>Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,210
<9-16,RUSS>我知道你的问题出在哪里
<9-16,RUSS>I know what your problem is.

341

<9-19,ROSS>嫉妒什么
<9-19,ROSS>Of what?

344
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,800
<9-20,RUSS>你嫉妒我是个真正的医生
<9-20,RUSS>You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

345
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,920
<9-21,ROSS>你是牙周病的医生
<9-21,ROSS>Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

346
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,870
<9-21,ROSS>那是人能够研究的最小的人体器官
<9-21,ROSS>That's the smallest body part you can major in.

347
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,700
<9-21,ROSS>就像是第一天才教你用牙线  第二天就发你文凭了
<9-21,ROSS>Looks like, Day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.

348
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,900
<9-22,RUSS>你给我听着
<9-22,RUSS>You listen here

<9-25,ROSS>不  你让我说完
<9-25,ROSS>No, you let me fin...

351
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,770
<10-1,RACH>乔伊走时有没有说他打算怎么做
<10-1,RACH>Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?

352
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,080
<10-2,CHAN>没有  我想他自己也不知道
<10-2,CHAN>No. I don't even think he knew.

353
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,170
<10-2,CHAN>你会为一份好工作跟别人上床吗
<10-2,CHAN>Would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?

354
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,940
<10-3,RACH>不知道  我得跟谁上床
<10-3,RACH>I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?

355
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,950
<10-4,CHAN>我
<10-4,CHAN>Me.

356
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,590
<10-5,RACH>我为什么得跟你上床
<10-5,RACH>Why would I have to sleep with you?

357
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,380
<10-6,CHAN>这是我定的  这工作你到底要不要
<10-6,CHAN>It's my game. You want the job or not?

358
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,540
<10-7,CHAN>早
<10-7,CHAN>Morning.

359
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,740
<10-9,ROSS>你去哪里
<10-9,ROSS>Where you going?

360
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,340
<10-10,MNCA>我要跟鲍比去小木屋度周末  记得吗
<10-10,MNCA>Bobby and I are going away for the weekend. Remember?

361
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,210
<10-12,PHOE>带那么多酒干什么
<10-12,PHOE>What's with all the bottles of liquor?

362
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,860
<10-13,ROSS>怎么了  鲍比又开始喝酒了
<10-13,ROSS>What's going on? Is Bobby drinking again?

363
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,110
<10-14,MNCA>不  这不是给他的  是我自己留着喝的
<10-14,MNCA>Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me.

364
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,260
<10-14,MNCA>这样他会很清醒
<10-14,MNCA>That way he's still sober

365
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,320
<10-14,MNCA>而我会觉得他的鞋带笑话好笑多了
<10-14,MNCA>but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.

366
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,320
<10-15,RACH>天啊  他连敲门都这么乏味
<10-15,RACH>God! Even his knock is boring!

367
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,230
<10-17,FBOB>-我马上就好了  -我可以跟你谈一谈吗
<10-17,FBOB>- I'll be ready in a second. - Uh, can I talk to you a minute?

368
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,290
<10-18,MNCA>可以
<10-18,MNCA>Sure.

369
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,730
<10-19,FBOB>我真的很难开口
<10-19,FBOB>This is really hard for me to say.

370
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,140
<10-20,MNCA>天啊  你又开始喝酒了
<10-20,MNCA>God. You fell off the wagon!

371
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,320
<10-21,FBOB>不是
<10-21,FBOB>Oh, no, no.

372
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,880
<10-21,FBOB>是关于你的
<10-21,FBOB>It's about you.

373
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,270
<10-22,MNCA>我怎么了
<10-22,MNCA>What about me?

374
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,090
<10-23,FBOB>我想你或许有酗酒问题
<10-23,FBOB>I think you may have a drinking problem.

375
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,880
<10-24,MNCA>你是说这些
<10-24,MNCA>What, these?

376
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,500
<10-24,MNCA>不  这些事擦伤口用的
<10-24,MNCA>No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

377
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,880
<10-25,FBOB>我现在无法投入一段相互依赖的关系当中
<10-25,FBOB>Look, I'm not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?

378
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,550
<10-26,MNCA>该死
<10-26,MNCA>Oh, shoot.

379
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,120
<10-27,FBOB>-不管怎么样  我希望我们还是朋友  -好
<10-27,FBOB>- Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends. - OK.

380
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,700
<10-29,MNCA>保重了
<10-29,MNCA>Take care.

381
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,600
<10-30,FBOB>-你也是  -再见
<10-30,FBOB>- You too. - Goodbye.

382
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,730
<10-31,RACH>怎么了
<10-31,RACH>What happened?

383
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,320
<10-32,MNCA>我们分手了
<10-32,MNCA>We kind of broke up.

384
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,550
<10-34,MNCA>这些酒谁要
<10-34,MNCA>Does anybody want these?

385
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,110
<10-35,CHAN>我拿一瓶
<10-35,CHAN>I'll take one.

386
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,980
<10-35,CHAN>我有时拿着这种东西  假装我是个巨人
<10-35,CHAN>Sometimes I hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

387
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,330
<10-38,ROSS>复试结果怎么样
<10-38,ROSS>How'd the callback go?

388
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,400
<10-39,JOEY>简直不可思议  我一进去  她就对我大展手脚
<10-39,JOEY>It was unbelievable. I walked in there and she was all over me.

389
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,490
<10-41,JOEY>-结果呢  -我就是办不到
<10-41,JOEY>- What did you do? - I couldn't do it.

390
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,620
<10-41,JOEY>我告诉她我不想那样得到角色
<10-41,JOEY>I told her I didn't want the part that way.

391
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,670
<10-42,ROSS>干得好
<10-42,ROSS>Good for you!

392
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,970
<10-43,JOEY>等等  我离开她办公室之后
<10-43,JOEY>But wait, wait, wait! Then after I left her office...

393
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,760
<10-43,JOEY>她追我到电梯  给了我一个更重要的角色
<10-43,JOEY>she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me a bigger part.

394
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,000
<10-44,PHOE>所以呢
<10-44,PHOE>So, and?

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
<10-45,JOEY>所以  各位面前站的是
<10-45,JOEY>So, you are now looking at

396
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,340
<10-45,JOEY>神经外科医生  德雷克·拉莫雷
<10-45,JOEY>Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

397
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,330
<10-45,JOEY>至少会在四集里面出镜
<10-45,JOEY>... recurring in at least four episodes!

398
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,860
<10-47,JOEY>好了  我去洗澡了
<10-47,JOEY>All right, I gotta go shower.

399
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,610
<11-4,RUSS>你们听说我被瑞秋甩了吧
<11-4,RUSS>I guess you guys heard Rachel dumped me.

400
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,760
<11-5,CHAN>是的  很遗撼  兄弟
<11-5,CHAN>Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

401
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,970
<11-6,RUSS>她说我会让她想起另外一个人
<11-6,RUSS>She said I remind her too much of somebody.

402
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,040
<11-6,RUSS>你们知道那个人是谁吗
<11-6,RUSS>Any idea who she's talking about?

403
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,170
<11-7,PHOE>我知道  是鲍勃·萨吉特
<11-7,PHOE>Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

404

<11-7,PHOE>她讨厌他
<11-7,PHOE>She hates him.

405

<11-12,JULIE>我不知道  没有了罗斯  的确很不对劲
<11-12,JULIE>I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross,

408
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,970
<11-12,JULIE>但我还好吧
<11-12,JULIE>... but I guess I'm doing okay.
