<1-11,ROSS>We're uh, we're getting married.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,130
<1-13,ROSS>就像"现在宣布你们结为妻妻"那样正式吗
<1-13,ROSS>As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,370
<1-14,CAROL>我们欢迎你来
<1-14,CAROL>Anyway, we'd like you to come,

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,050
<1-14,CAROL>但你不想来的话  我们也完全了解
<1-14,CAROL>but we totally understand if you don't want to.

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,980
<1-15,ROSS>我为什么会不想去
<1-15,ROSS>Why wouldn't I want to come?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,430
<1-15,ROSS>我第一次结婚时就很开心
<1-15,ROSS>I had fun at the first wedding.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,270
<1-16,CAROL>听着  我想也许...
<1-16,CAROL>Look, I just thought that...

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,730
<1-17,ROSS>不  我难道不该替你们高兴吗
<1-17,ROSS>No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you?

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,700
<1-17,ROSS>如果我不能分享你的快乐  那我算什么呢
<1-17,ROSS>What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy?

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,310
<1-17,ROSS>我为你感到高兴  相信我
<1-17,ROSS>I'm revelling, baby, believe me!

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,840
<1-18,SUSAN>你的手指被椅子夹住了吗
<1-18,SUSAN>Is your finger caught in that chair?

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,690
<1-18,SUSAN>要我们走吗
<1-18,SUSAN>Want us to go?

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,210
<2-1,ROSS>真厉害  你真要上电视了
<2-1,ROSS>This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.

40
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,600
<2-2,JOEY>我知道  我昨晚真正意识到
<2-2,JOEY>I know. It really hit me last night.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,640
<2-2,JOEY>我要出演《我们的日子》了
<2-2,JOEY>I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,310
<2-2,JOEY>然后我开始想我们的事
<2-2,JOEY>And then I started thinkin' about all of us,

43
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,830
<2-2,JOEY>我发现这正是"我们的日子"
<2-2,JOEY>and how these are the days of our lives..

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,800
<2-2,JOEY>-太好了  -怎么了
<2-2,JOEY>- Yes! - What?

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,990
<2-3,MONICA>承办卡罗尔跟苏珊的酒席的人
<2-3,MONICA>Carol and Susan's caterer

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,660
<2-3,MONICA>这周末骑登山车出了车祸
<2-3,MONICA>had a mountain bike accident this weekend,

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,470
<2-3,MONICA>全身都上了石膏
<2-3,MONICA>and she's in a full body cast.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,910
<2-3,MONICA>太好了
<2-3,MONICA>Yes!

49
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,970
<2-4,MONICA>他们要我接手  这太好了
<2-4,MONICA>They want me to do it, which is really cool,

50
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,230
<2-4,MONICA>我从来没承办过酒席
<2-4,MONICA>seeing as I've never catered before,

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,040
<2-4,MONICA>现在又很缺钱  你没问题吧
<2-4,MONICA>and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,820
<2-6,MONICA>-有什么关系吗  -你真善解人意  谢谢
<2-6,MONICA>- Would it matter? - Oh, you are so great! Thank you!

53
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,560
<2-7,JOEY>-你真的不去吗  -我真的不去
<2-7,JOEY>- Are you really not going? - I am really not going.

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,030
<2-8,ROSS>我不懂  她们已经同居了 为什么还要结婚
<2-8,ROSS>I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,160
<2-9,MONICA>因为他们相爱
<2-9,MONICA>Because they love each other,

56
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,510
<2-9,MONICA>她们想跟亲朋好友一起庆祝这份爱
<2-9,MONICA>and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,220
<2-10,ROSS>这也勉强算一个理由
<2-10,ROSS>If you wanna call that a reason.

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,220
<2-11,CHANDLER>*谁是客厅里最痛苦的人*

<2-12,MONICA>罗斯  我以为你不在意了
<2-12,MONICA>Ross, I thought you were over this.

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,030
<2-13,ROSS>这和在不在意没关系
<2-13,ROSS>Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok?

64
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,160
<2-13,ROSS>她是我前妻
<2-13,ROSS>She's my ex-wife.

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,530
<2-13,ROSS>她要是嫁了个男的  那我不去就理所当然了
<2-13,ROSS>If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.

66
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,730
<2-14,JOEY>她要是嫁了个男的
<2-14,JOEY>Hey, if she were marrying a guy,

67
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,060
<2-14,JOEY>岂不是史上最不厚道的同志了
<2-14,JOEY>she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.

68
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,820
<2-15,RACHEL>我错过了吗  我错过了吗
<2-15,RACHEL>Did I miss it? Did I miss it?

69
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,950
<2-16,JOEY>还没  这家伙自杀后就该我出场了
<2-16,JOEY>No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.

70
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,850
<2-17,CHANDLER>-她很养眼  -对  她人也很好
<2-17,CHANDLER>- Whoa, she's pretty.- Yeah, and she's really nice too.

71
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,930
<2-18,JOEY>她教我怎么样在镜头前演戏
<2-18,JOEY>She taught me all about you know, how to work with the cameras,

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,890
<2-18,JOEY>还教我闻屁味表演法
<2-18,JOEY>and smell-the-fart acting.

73
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,480
<2-19,RACHEL>-对不起  -什么闻屁味表演法
<2-19,RACHEL>- I'm sorry, what? - What? Smell-the-fart acting.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,910
<2-20,MONICA>在短时间内要记那么多台词
<2-20,MONICA>It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast,

75
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,270
<2-21,JOEY>有时候你需要时间想下一句
<2-21,JOEY>that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.

76
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,830
<2-21,JOEY>所以当你酝酿下句的时候
<2-21,JOEY>So while you're thinkin' of it,

77
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,330
<2-21,JOEY>你停顿一下  表情装得非常的凝重
<2-21,JOEY>you take this big pause where you look all intense,

78
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,590
<2-21,JOEY>就像这样
<2-21,JOEY>you know, like this.

79
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,080
<2-22,CHANDLER>这样啊
<2-22,CHANDLER>Ok.

80
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,370
<2-23,JOEY>轮到我了  我的戏
<2-23,JOEY>There's my scene, there's my scene.

85
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,970
<2-25,JOEY>恐怕令妹的病情比我们预想的还糟
<2-25,JOEY>I'm afraid the situation is much more dier than we expected.

88
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,540
<2-25,JOEY>或许我们可以边喝咖啡边聊病情
<2-25,JOEY>Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.

<2-29,CHANDLER>有那么一会  我还真以为你闻到了什么味道
<2-29,CHANDLER>For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.

91
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,900
<2-30,ROSS>再来一次  演得太棒了  再来一次

<2-31,JOEY>"Damn it, Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"

94

<2-32,CHANDLER>I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

96

<2-37,ROSS>- Is everything ok? - Um, no, huh-uh.

99
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,710
<2-38,PHOEBE>今天我有个客人死在按摩床上
<2-38,PHOEBE>One of my clients died on the massage table today.

100
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,940
<2-39,ROSS>天啊
<2-39,ROSS>Oh my god.

101
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,060
<2-40,CHANDLER>你的客人也有点放松过头了吧
<2-40,CHANDLER>That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.

102
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,250
<2-41,PHOEBE>对  她已经八十二岁了
<2-41,PHOEBE>Yeah, um, she was 82 years old.

<2-41,PHOEBE>她叫艾德曼太太
<2-41,PHOEBE>Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.

104

<2-42,MONICA>-亲爱的  -对  感觉怪怪的
<2-42,MONICA>- Oh, honey. - Yeah, it's just so strange.

105
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,880
<2-43,PHOEBE>她早上醒来时说不定在想
<2-43,PHOEBE>I mean, she probably woke up today and thought,

106
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,410
<2-43,PHOEBE>"我去吃点早餐"
<2-43,PHOEBE>"ok, I'll have some breakfast,

107
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,510
<2-43,PHOEBE>"再去散会儿步  然后去做个小按摩"
<2-43,PHOEBE>and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."

108
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,090
<2-43,PHOEBE>她怎么会料到上帝在想
<2-43,PHOEBE>Little did she know God was thinking,

109
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,090
<2-43,PHOEBE>"好  但到此为止"
<2-43,PHOEBE>"Ok, but that's it."

110
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,880
<2-43,PHOEBE>最诡异的事情是
<2-43,PHOEBE>Oh, but the weirdest thing was,

111
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,860
<2-43,PHOEBE>她死的时候我正在清她的灵气
<2-43,PHOEBE>ok, I was cleansing her aura when that happened,

112
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,570
<2-44,RACHEL>当她的灵魂离开身体的时候
<2-44,RACHEL>and when the spirit left her body,

113
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,220
<2-45,PHOEBE>我觉得它没走远
<2-45,PHOEBE>I don't think it went very far.

114
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,920
<2-44,RACHEL>什么意思
<2-44,RACHEL>What do you mean?

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,930
<2-45,PHOEBE>我想它上了我的身
<2-45,PHOEBE>I think it went into me.

116
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,730
<3-1,MONICA>太难抉择了  我决定不了选羔羊还是鸭子
<3-1,MONICA>God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.

117
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,770
<3-2,CHANDLER>当然了  羔羊比较恐怖
<3-2,CHANDLER>Well, of course, lambs are scarier.

118
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,920
<3-2,CHANDLER>不然那部电影就叫《沉默的鸭子》了
<3-2,CHANDLER>Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.

120
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,460
<3-3,RACHEL>好了  谁点了什么
<3-3,RACHEL>Ok, who ordered what?

121
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,890
<3-4,ROSS>我一定点了喝了一半的卡布奇诺
<3-4,ROSS>Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino

128
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,370
<3-8,RACHEL>我没嫁给巴瑞  我的生活就完全是垃圾
<3-8,RACHEL>because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?

<3-11,PHOEBE>不知道  老太太肯定还有什么未了的心愿
<3-11,PHOEBE>I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.

185
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,780
<4-16,RACHEL>不  他们连话都不讲
<4-16,RACHEL>No! They didn't even talk to each other.

186
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,450
<4-16,RACHEL>天啊  我怎么会知道他们有矛盾
<4-16,RACHEL>God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?

187
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,010
<4-17,PHOEBE>在我那个时代  可没离婚这档子事
<4-17,PHOEBE>In my day, divorce was not an option.

188
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,580
<4-18,JOEY>看谁醒了
<4-18,JOEY>Hey, look who's up.

<4-19,RACHEL>我只是无法相信会这样
<4-19,RACHEL>I just can't believe this is happening.

190
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,660
<4-19,RACHEL>我小时候每个人的父母都在闹离婚
<4-19,RACHEL>I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced.

191
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,420
<4-19,RACHEL>我只是觉得  我长大就不用担心这事了
<4-19,RACHEL>I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.

192
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,240
<4-20,MONICA>你能不能把她这一举动当做对你的讨好呢
<4-20,MONICA>Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering?

193
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,830
<4-20,MONICA>她这样做是想向你学习
<4-20,MONICA>I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.

194
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,380
<4-21,RACHEL>那她光学我的发型不就好了吗

195
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,240
<4-22,CHANDLER>我父母离婚时  他们还叫我去看心理医生
<4-22,CHANDLER>You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink,

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,680
<4-22,CHANDLER>她告诉我  所有的小孩都会自责
<4-22,CHANDLER>and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves.

197
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,330
<4-22,CHANDLER>就你而言  还真是那么回事
<4-22,CHANDLER>But in your case it's actually kinda true.

198
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,510
<4-23,PHOEBE>就是他
<4-23,PHOEBE>That's him.

<4-27,MR A>不过你的确打扰了我忙着呆坐的一天
<4-27,MR A>although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.

205

<4-29,MR A>I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up.

208

<4-29,MR A>我能帮你什么忙  亲爱的
<4-29,MR A>Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?

209
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,650
<4-30,PHOEBE>是这样  我不知道该怎么开口
<4-30,PHOEBE>OK. I don't know how to say this, but

210
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,210
<4-30,PHOEBE>当你太太的灵魂离开她身体的时候
<4-30,PHOEBE>I think when your wife's spirit left her body,

211
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,340
<4-30,PHOEBE>附到了我身上
<4-30,PHOEBE>it um, kind of stuck around in me.

212
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,070
<4-31,MR A>你说我太太在你身上
<4-31,MR A>You're saying, my wife is in you?

213
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,530
<4-32,PHOEBE>你用不着相信我
<4-32,PHOEBE>Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but

214
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,410
<4-32,PHOEBE>不过你能想出她有什么未完成的心愿吗
<4-32,PHOEBE>um, can you think of any unfinished business

215
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,400
<4-32,PHOEBE>有什么原因让她不肯离开吗
<4-32,PHOEBE>she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?

216
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,210
<4-33,MR A>我不知道该说什么  亲爱的
<4-33,MR A>Well, I don't know what to tell you dear.

217
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,300
<4-33,MR A>我唯一能够想到的是
<4-33,MR A>The only thing I can think of is that

218
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,120
<4-33,MR A>以前她常说  她死之前想见识一切
<4-33,MR A>she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

219
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,880
<4-34,PHOEBE>-一切吗  -一切
<4-34,PHOEBE>- Everything? - Everything.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,590
<4-36,PHOEBE>那可真是个大工程
<4-36,PHOEBE>Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.

221
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,500
<4-37,MR A>等等  我想起来了
<4-37,MR A>Oh, wait, I remember,

222
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,420
<4-37,MR A>她还说她想最后再跟我上一次床
<4-37,MR A>she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.

223
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,550
<4-38,PHOEBE>对不起  我脑袋里有笑声
<4-38,PHOEBE>I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.

224
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,040
<4-39,MR A>也值得一试吧
<4-39,MR A>Worth a shot, huh?

225
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,970

<4-42,MRS GREEN>他是直接从办公室赶过来的吗
<4-42,MRS GREEN>Did he have to come straight from the office?

229
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,720
<4-43,RACHEL>不  那是他的万圣节装束
<4-43,RACHEL>No, that was his costume.

230
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,980
<4-43,RACHEL>他是个正牙医生  但他扮成了普通牙医
<4-43,RACHEL>See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.

231
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,380
<4-44,MONICA>各位
<4-44,MONICA>Um, you guys,

232
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,450
<4-44,MONICA>记得我以前说"谢了  我自己可以"吗
<4-44,MONICA>you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?

233
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,240
<4-45,RACHEL>事实上  我想你说的是
<4-45,RACHEL>Actually, what I think you said was,

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,960
<4-45,RACHEL>"别乱碰东西  滚出我的厨房"
<4-45,RACHEL>"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."

237
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,360
<4-46,MONICA>只是现在我实际烹饪的时间不够用
<4-46,MONICA>It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.

238
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,160
<4-47,RACHEL>-摩妮卡  要帮忙吗  -最好不过

<4-50,RACHEL>She's still with you?

242
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,430
<4-51,PHOEBE>对  我想她还没全看遍呢
<4-51,PHOEBE>Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.

243
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,510
<4-51,PHOEBE>我马上回来  她必须再去一趟厕所
<4-51,PHOEBE>I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.

244

<4-52,MRS GREEN>-谁有大麻吗  -天啊
<4-52,MRS GREEN>- Does anybody have any marijuana? - God!

248
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,190
<4-54,MONICA>听着  不准在这堆食物旁边抽大麻
<4-54,MONICA>All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.

249
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,590
<4-55,MRS GREEN>没关系  我从没抽过  只想试一试
<4-55,MRS GREEN>That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might.

250
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,010

<4-59,MRS GREEN>我不是在说你爸爸不好  亲爱的
<4-59,MRS GREEN>I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie,

255
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,230
<4-59,MRS GREEN>我只是在想  或许有更好的呢
<4-59,MRS GREEN>but I was thinking there might be more.

<4-78,MONICA>I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs,

286
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,060
<4-78,MONICA>创造出一道新的开胃菜叫罗斯猪肉卷
<4-78,MONICA>and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross".

<4-79,CHANDLER>为什么我得切丁  他却可以挖香瓜球呢
<4-79,CHANDLER>Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.

289
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,580
<4-81,CAROL>进行得怎么样
<4-81,CAROL>How's it going?

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,960
<4-83,CAROL>好的  随便吧
<4-83,CAROL>That's fine, whatever.

293
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,380
<4-84,ROSS>怎么了
<4-84,ROSS>What's the matter?

294
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,190
<4-85,CAROL>没事  好吧  诸事不顺
<4-85,CAROL>Nothing. Ok, everything.

295
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,730
<4-85,CAROL>我想我们婚礼要取消了
<4-85,CAROL>I think we're calling off the wedding.

296
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,840
<4-87,MONICA>-什么  -你还是会付我钱的吧
<4-87,MONICA>- What? - You're still gonna pay me, right?

297
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,320
<4-87,MONICA>也不能太自私是吧
<4-87,MONICA>Or something a little less selfish.

298
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,720
<4-88,ROSS>卡罗尔  发生什么事了  怎么了
<4-88,ROSS>Carol, what's the matter? What happened?

299
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,160
<4-89,CAROL>-我爸妈下午来电话说他们不来了  -上帝
<4-89,CAROL>- My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming. - Oh my god.

300
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,480
<4-91,CAROL>我知道他们不赞成这件事
<4-91,CAROL>I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing,

301
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,900
<4-91,CAROL>可他们毕竟是我父母
<4-91,CAROL>but they're my parents.

302
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,020
<4-91,CAROL>他们应该把我嫁出去的
<4-91,CAROL>They're supposed to give me away and everything.

303
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,680
<4-92,ROSS>好的  别难过了
<4-92,ROSS>It's ok. I'm sorry.

304
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,420
<4-93,CAROL>然后我跟苏珊大吵了一架
<4-93,CAROL>And then Susan and I got in this big fight

305
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,410
<4-93,CAROL>因为我说或许应该取消婚礼
<4-93,CAROL>because I said maybe we should call off the wedding,

306
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,490
<4-93,CAROL>然后她说  我们结婚不是为了他们
<4-93,CAROL>and she said we weren't doing it for them,

307
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,660
<4-93,CAROL>而是为了我们自己
<4-93,CAROL>we were doing it for us,

308
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,550
<4-93,CAROL>我不认清这点的话
<4-93,CAROL>and if I couldn't see that,

309
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,220
<4-93,CAROL>或许我们真该取消婚礼
<4-93,CAROL>then maybe we should call off the wedding.

310
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,890
<4-93,CAROL>我不知道该怎么办
<4-93,CAROL>I don't know what to do.

311
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,170
<4-94,ROSS>不敢相信我要说这些话
<4-94,ROSS>I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this,

312
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,260
<4-94,ROSS>但我认为苏珊说得对
<4-94,ROSS>but I think Susan's right.

313
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,930
<4-95,CAROL>真的吗
<4-95,CAROL>You do?

314
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,370
<4-96,ROSS>你爱她吗  你不用说得太斩钉截铁
<4-96,ROSS>Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.

315
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,480
<4-97,CAROL>我当然爱她了
<4-97,CAROL>Of course I do.

316
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,210
<4-98,ROSS>那就是了
<4-98,ROSS>Well then that's it.

317
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,020
<4-98,ROSS>如果你父母无法接受  就让他们去吧
<4-98,ROSS>And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.

318
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,860
<4-98,ROSS>听着  如果我的父母不让我娶你
<4-98,ROSS>Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you,

319
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,700
<4-98,ROSS>那绝对阻止不了我
<4-98,ROSS>no way that would have stopped me.

320
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,220
<4-98,ROSS>这是你的婚礼  办吧
<4-98,ROSS>Look, this is your wedding. Do it.

321
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,170
<4-99,CAROL>你说得对  当然你是对的
<4-99,CAROL>You're right. Of course you're right.

322
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,950
<4-100,MONICA>-那我们继续吗  -继续吧
<4-100,MONICA>- So we're back on? - We're back on.

323
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,030
<4-102,MONICA>你们都听到了  削啊  剁啊  切啊
<4-102,MONICA>You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil!

324
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,790
<4-102,MONICA>真不敢相信  我耽误了两分钟
<4-102,MONICA>I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.

325
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,430
<5-1,JOEY>真是巧妇难为无米之炊
<5-1,JOEY>It just seems so futile, you know?

326
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,680
<5-1,JOEY>这么多女人  却无法下手
<5-1,JOEY>All these women, and nothing.

327
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,590
<5-1,JOEY>我觉得自己像失去超能力的超人
