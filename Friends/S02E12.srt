1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,940
<1-1,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>感觉不堪重负
<1-1,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
<1-1,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>那就来一杯
<1-1,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>Then put it in your mouth...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>猴子乐啤酒
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>...With MonkeyShine Beer.

4
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,330
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>猴子乐啤酒
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>MonkeyShine Beer,

5
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,940
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>尽享自在生活
<1-2,COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER>'cause it's a jungle out there.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,570
<1-3,ROSS>那支广告总让我悲从中来
<1-3,ROSS>That commercial always makes me so sad.

7
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,490
<1-4,JOEY>但是那个家伙一开啤酒  女人就拥上来了
<1-4,JOEY>Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him,

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,720
<1-4,JOEY>所以结果还是不错的
<1-4,JOEY>so, everything seems to work out OK.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,750
<1-5,ROSS>那只猴子让我想到了马塞尔
<1-5,ROSS>I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,920
<1-6,PHOEBE>我看得出来
<1-6,PHOEBE>I can see that,

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,490
<1-6,PHOEBE>它们都有棕色的大眼睛  还有鼓鼓的小下巴
<1-6,PHOEBE>'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,830
<1-7,MONICA>而且它们都是猴子
<1-7,MONICA>And the fact that they're both monkeys.

13
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:55,560
<1-8,ROSS>有时我怀疑  我把它送走是对还是错
<1-8,ROSS>Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,850
<1-9,RACHEL>罗斯  你也是迫不得已  他看到什么都要去拨弄
<1-9,RACHEL>Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight.

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,790
<1-9,RACHEL>我的马里布芭比结婚都穿不上穿白纱了
<1-9,RACHEL>I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,800
<1-10,ROSS>记得有时它会跟你借帽子
<1-10,ROSS>Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat,

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,820
<1-10,ROSS>等你要回来的时候  里面会有几粒猴葡萄干
<1-10,ROSS>and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,550
<1-11,CHANDLER>它干的就叫好玩  换做我对我老板这么做的话
<1-11,CHANDLER>Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . .

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,450
<1-11,CHANDLER>突然就上升到了态度问题的高度
<1-11,CHANDLER>all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,560
<2-1,JOEY>嘿  嘿  看嘿  猜我得到了什么嘿

<2-13,CHANDLER>我想它会很惊喜的
<2-13,CHANDLER>You know I think he will be surprised,

54
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,180
<2-13,CHANDLER>直到它发现自己是猴子
<2-13,CHANDLER>'till he realizes he's a monkey,

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,240

<3-7,CHANDLER>对  用平底锅打她是个好主意
<3-7,CHANDLER>Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea.

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,380
<3-7,CHANDLER>我们还得想个备用计划  以防她不是卡通人物

<3-10,JOEY>她不会认出我  因为我们没见过
<3-10,JOEY>she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.

79
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,000

<4-2,ROSS>我找不到我去年捐的猴子了
<4-2,ROSS>Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year.

90
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,260
<4-2,ROSS>它是一只戴帽猿  名叫马塞尔
<4-2,ROSS>He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.

91
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,910
<4-3,LIPSON>我恐怕有个坏消息要告诉你
<4-3,LIPSON>Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,570
<4-3,LIPSON>马塞尔已经过世了
<4-3,LIPSON>Marcel has passed on.

93
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,410
<4-4,ROSS>天呐  怎么会呢
<4-4,ROSS>Oh my God, what happened?

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,810
<4-5,LIPSON>它生病了  然后病情加重了
<4-5,LIPSON>Well he got sick, and then he got sicker,

95
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,650
<4-5,LIPSON>然后有点好转
<4-5,LIPSON>and then he got a little better

96
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,910
<4-5,LIPSON>可后来就死了
<4-5,LIPSON>but then he died.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,220
<4-6,ROSS>我真不敢相信
<4-6,ROSS>I can't believe this.

98
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,050
<4-7,LIPSON>请节哀  盖勒先生
<4-7,LIPSON>I'm sorry. Mr. Geller.

99
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,010
<4-7,LIPSON>可你也知道  俗话说
<4-7,LIPSON>But ya know, there's an old saying,

100
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,570
<4-7,LIPSON>"猴子难免一死"
<4-7,LIPSON>'Sometimes monkeys die.'

101
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:12,400
<4-7,LIPSON>不是什么精辟的俗语  但...
<4-7,LIPSON>It's not a great saying, but...

102
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,230
<4-7,LIPSON>用在当下很贴切
<4-7,LIPSON>it certainly is fitting today.

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,510
<4-8,ROSS>那也应该有人通知我才对
<4-8,ROSS>Well, ya know, someone should have called me.

104
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,800
<4-9,LIPSON>抱歉  我知道这样也不能让它起死回生
<4-9,LIPSON>I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
<4-9,LIPSON>这是我一点心意  请收下
<4-9,LIPSON>but here, it's just a gesture.

106
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,970
<4-10,ROSS>动物园礼券
<4-10,ROSS>Zoo dollars?

<4-11,LIPSON>Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,010
<4-11,LIPSON>你的猴子没死的话  表演得可爱多了
<4-11,LIPSON>Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

109
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,330
<5-1,KIDS>我知道
<5-1,KIDS>I know.

110
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,870
<5-2,PHOEBE>真不敢相信  乔伊去跟他的变态影迷吃饭了
<5-2,PHOEBE>I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.

111
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,570
<5-3,MONICA>她长得怎么样
<5-3,MONICA>What i-, what is she like.

112
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,420

<5-4,CHANDLER>- Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? - Yeah.

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,740
<5-6,CHANDLER>她长得跟她恰恰相反
<5-6,CHANDLER>Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

115
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,330
<5-7,RACHEL>那她不是疯子吗
<5-7,RACHEL>And she's not crazy?

116
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,600
<5-8,CHANDLER>不  她是个不折不扣的怪人
<5-8,CHANDLER>Oh no no no, she's a total wack job.

117
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,920
<5-8,CHANDLER>她以为乔伊真的是德雷克·拉莫雷医生
<5-8,CHANDLER>Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.

118
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,290
<5-9,RACHEL>我的天
<5-9,RACHEL>Oh my God.

119
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,690
<5-10,MONICA>然后他还要去跟她约会  他不能将错就错
<5-10,MONICA>Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

120
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,460
<5-11,CHANDLER>就因为这个女人以为
<5-11,CHANDLER>Hey, just because this woman thinks

121
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,190
<5-11,CHANDLER>她可以在她家客厅的魔法盒里看到乔伊
<5-11,CHANDLER>she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room

122
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,800
<5-11,CHANDLER>并不表示她就不是个人
<5-11,CHANDLER>doesn't mean she's not a person.

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,060
<5-11,CHANDLER>她不配得到快乐  不配拥有爱吗
<5-11,CHANDLER>I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love?

124
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,110

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,120
<5-13,PHOEBE>如果我幻想他们只穿着内衣
<5-13,PHOEBE>So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.

128
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,700
<5-14,ROB>不好  上个家伙就是那样被开除的
<5-14,ROB>That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.

129
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,770
<5-15,PHOEBE>我只是习惯为大人演唱
<5-15,PHOEBE>I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups.

130
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,290

<5-15,PHOEBE>This is a huge responsibility. What?

133
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,950
<5-15,PHOEBE>你要亲我吗
<5-15,PHOEBE>Are you gonna kiss me?

<5-19,PHOEBE>奶奶人见人爱
<5-19,PHOEBE>Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes,

140

<5-19,PHOEBE>上回你看到她时  她消瘦多了
<5-19,PHOEBE>And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.

143
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,690
<5-19,PHOEBE>你爸妈说她搬去了秘鲁
<5-19,PHOEBE>Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,

144
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,350
<5-19,PHOEBE>其实她过世了  你终有一天也会死去
<5-19,PHOEBE>but the truth is she died and some day you will too.

145

<10-7,JANITOR>他们当然会说它死了  他们怕传出去影响不好
<10-7,JANITOR>Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity.

216
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,380
<10-7,JANITOR>他们掩饰得密不透风
<10-7,JANITOR>It's all a great big cover-up.
