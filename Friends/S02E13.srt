136
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,010

<5-13,CHANDLER>Like when you're cooking a steak.

137
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,020
<5-14,PHOEBE>好吧  我不吃肉

<5-18,CHANDLER>We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...

143
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,600
<5-18,CHANDLER>突然她转过来对我说
<5-18,CHANDLER>...and then she turns to me and says:

144
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,680
<5-18,CHANDLER>"你想过在电梯里做吗"
<5-18,CHANDLER>"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"

<5-20,CHANDLER>我相信我的回答是"呦嘻呼啦"
<5-20,CHANDLER>I believe my exact words were 'Flaign,en - sten'.

147
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,850
<5-20,CHANDLER>我不知道该说什么  你怎么知道你想不想在电梯里做
<5-20,CHANDLER>I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

<6-3,SUSIE>两百秒钟的激情  我们得走了
<6-3,SUSIE>Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.

153
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,320
<6-3,SUSIE>但是
<6-3,SUSIE>But...

154
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,740
<6-4,SUSIE>我有个主意
<6-4,SUSIE>... here's an idea.

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,780
<6-4,SUSIE>你有没有穿过女人的内裤
<6-4,SUSIE>Have you ever worn women's underwear?

156
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,280
<6-5,CHANDLER>实际上穿过
<6-5,CHANDLER>Well, yes, actually...

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,370
<6-5,CHANDLER>是我艾德娜姑妈的
<6-5,CHANDLER>... but they were my Aunt Edna's.

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,480
<6-5,CHANDLER>一条裤子里挤了三个人
<6-5,CHANDLER>And there were three of us in there.

159
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,920
<6-6,SUSIE>我在想  如果你今天吃晚饭时
<6-6,SUSIE>I was thinking it would be kind of sexy...

160
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,820
<6-6,SUSIE>穿我的内裤  会很性感
<6-6,SUSIE>...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

161
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,700
<6-7,CHANDLER>你要我穿你内裤
<6-7,CHANDLER>You want me to wear your panties?

162
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,250
<6-8,SUSIE>可以吗
<6-8,SUSIE>Could you?

163
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,360
