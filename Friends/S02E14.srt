<3-9,CHANDLER>她这话有内涵
<3-9,CHANDLER>Oh, she's going somewhere.

96
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,280
<3-10,PHOEBE>谁不晓得  龙虾一旦恋爱  就会白头偕老
<3-10,PHOEBE>C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.

<3-12,MONICA>我想这第五个澡应该把我面试的阴影给洗掉了
<3-12,MONICA>Yeah, I think that fifth shower got the interview off me.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,820
<3-13,PHOEBE>还有其它可能性吗
<3-13,PHOEBE>Do you have other possibilities?

103
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,420
<3-15,ROSS>摩妮卡  需要的话  我可以借你点钱

105
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,420
<3-16,MONICA>我看到你就会紧张内疚
<3-16,MONICA>then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.

106
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,280
<3-17,ROSS>那你要不跟爸妈借吧
<3-17,ROSS>Then why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?

107
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,480
<3-17,ROSS>反正你看到他们本来就会紧张内疚
<3-17,ROSS>You feel guilty and tense around them already.

108
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,120
<3-17,ROSS>还不如趁机会跟他们刮点钱
<3-17,ROSS>Might as well make some money off of them.

<8-2,CHANDLER>表达我对你的歉意  还有悔恨
<8-2,CHANDLER>...as a symbol of my sorrow and regret.

233
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,170
<8-2,CHANDLER>跟古时候的人一样
<8-2,CHANDLER>Much like they did in biblical times.

234
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,360
<8-2,CHANDLER>虽然你现在还很生气
<8-2,CHANDLER>Though you may have the anger now....

235
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,020
<8-2,CHANDLER>那个斯黛菲·格拉芙屁股真翘
<8-2,CHANDLER>You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush.

237
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,440
<8-2,CHANDLER>我只是说说而已  就在电视上
<8-2,CHANDLER>I'm just saying! It's right there!

<9-4,ROSS>没  他在卡罗尔跟苏珊家里
<9-4,ROSS>No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.

242
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,130
<9-5,MR. GELLER>我办公室有一个女的是同志
<9-5,MR. GELLER>A woman in my office is a lesbian.

243
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,030
<9-5,MR. GELLER>没别的意思
<9-5,MR. GELLER>I'm just saying!

244
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,420
<9-6,MRS. GELLER>杰克  你看  你觉得很好笑的油漆广告来了
<9-6,MRS. GELLER>Jack, look! There's that house paint commercial that cracks you up!

<9-7,MONICA>-你去哪里了 -人间炼狱
<9-7,MONICA>- Where have you been? - Emotional hell.

246
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,980
<9-8,ROSS>他们有没有借你钱
<9-8,ROSS>So, did they lend you the money yet?

247
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,070
<9-9,MONICA>没  可能是因为我还没开口
<9-9,MONICA>No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.

248
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,510
<9-10,ROSS>快去  摩妮卡  去说吧
<9-10,ROSS>Come on, Monica, do it.

249

251
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,430
<9-11,MONICA>抱歉我以前没告诉你们
<9-11,MONICA>So listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but...

252
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,530
<9-11,MONICA>我现在失业了  我被迫离职了
<9-11,MONICA>... I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it.

253
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,120
<9-12,MRS. GELLER>为什么
<9-12,MRS. GELLER>Why?

254
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,710
<9-13,MONICA>公司的决定
<9-13,MONICA>Because they made me.

255
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,760
<9-14,MRS. GELLER>你被炒鱿鱼  那你准备怎么办
<9-14,MRS. GELLER>You were fired? What are you gonna do?

256
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,010
<9-15,MR. GELLER>朱迪  放心  这可是我们的小妮妮宝贝
<9-15,MR. GELLER>Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica we're talking about.

257
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,630
<9-15,MR. GELLER>我们教导有方
<9-15,MR. GELLER>We taught her well.

258
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,230
<9-15,MR. GELLER>-薪水的百分之十上哪儿去了  -存银行了
<9-15,MR. GELLER>- Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? - In the bank.

259
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,900
<9-17,MR. GELLER>这就对了  她在吃她的老本  存钱就是应急用的
<9-17,MR. GELLER>There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for.

260
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,230
<9-17,MR. GELLER>她不会有事的
<9-17,MR. GELLER>She's gonna be fine.

261
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,050
<9-17,MR. GELLER>如果那些钱还不够用的话
<9-17,MR. GELLER>And if you need a little extra,

262
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,810
<9-17,MR. GELLER>你知道哪里有钱
<9-17,MR. GELLER>...you know where to find it.

263
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,080
<9-18,MONICA>有面额大一点的吗
<9-18,MONICA>Anything larger back there?

264
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,660
<10-1,CHANDLER>真不敢相信
<10-1,CHANDLER>I can't believe it!

265
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,740
<10-2,PHOEBE>别有怨天尤人了好吗
<10-2,PHOEBE>Would you stop already?

266
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,450
<10-2,PHOEBE>别再闷闷不乐了  高兴一点
<10-2,PHOEBE>Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

<10-3,CHANDLER>你说得对  我应该高兴一点
<10-3,CHANDLER>Oh, you're right. I should play in the hay.

268
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,810
<10-3,CHANDLER>忘了我刚才花了四百块
<10-3,CHANDLER>Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars

269
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,260
<10-3,CHANDLER>去买一个我讨厌的手镯这件事
<10-3,CHANDLER>to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with.

270
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,620
<10-3,CHANDLER>逗我开心啊
<10-3,CHANDLER>Bring on the hay!

271
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,690

<10-10,CHANDLER>This one's for you.

278
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,350
<10-11,JOEY>少来了
<10-11,JOEY>Get out!

<10-12,CHANDLER>No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you

281
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,130
<10-12,CHANDLER>我也知道这不只是首饰而已
<10-12,CHANDLER>and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,

282
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,930
<10-12,CHANDLER>事关你跟我  还有我们是"好兄弟"
<10-12,CHANDLER>It's about you and me and the fact that we're "best buds."

283
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,050
<10-13,JOEY>这是友谊的象征吗  我觉得是
<10-13,JOEY>Is this friendship? I think so!

284

<12-1,MONICA>我高中时穿的泳衣  我那时体型有点大
<12-1,MONICA>That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.

295
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,690
<12-2,CHANDLER>我还以为是给康涅狄格州挡雨用的呢
<12-2,CHANDLER>I thought they used that to cover Connecticut when it rains.

296
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,410
<12-3,JOEY>摩妮卡  这带子里有什么

<12-12,CHANDLER>我错了  那才是用来给康涅狄格州遮雨的
<12-12,CHANDLER>Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
