1
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,390
<1-1,JOEY>老兄  真奇怪
<1-1,JOEY>Man, this is weird.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,640
<1-1,JOEY>你发现了吗  脆脆上尉的眉毛长在帽子上
<1-1,JOEY>You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:10,940
<1-2,CHANDLER>那就叫奇怪了
<1-2,CHANDLER>That's what's weird?

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,210
<1-2,CHANDLER>乔伊  他已经当了四十年早餐片的上尉
<1-2,CHANDLER>Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,890
<1-4,JOEY>怎样
<1-4,JOEY>What?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,100
<1-5,CHANDLER>汤匙  你舔完放回去
<1-5,CHANDLER>The spoon! You licked and you put.

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-5,CHANDLER>你舔完放回去
<1-5,CHANDLER>You licked and you put.

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,030
<1-6,JOEY>是啊  怎么了
<1-6,JOEY>Yeah, so?

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,020
<1-7,CHANDLER>你不知道有多恶心吗
<1-7,CHANDLER>Don't you see how gross that is?

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,770
<1-7,CHANDLER>就像你用我的牙刷一样
<1-7,CHANDLER>I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,840
<1-7,CHANDLER>你用了我的牙刷
<1-7,CHANDLER>You used my toothbrush?

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,630
<1-8,JOEY>那是因为我用红的那支去通排水孔了
<1-8,JOEY>Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,920
<1-9,CHANDLER>红色是我的
<1-9,CHANDLER>Mine is the red one!

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,230
<1-9,CHANDLER>真是一发就不可收拾了
<1-9,CHANDLER>Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,350
<1-10,JOEY>为什么牙刷不能共用
<1-10,JOEY>Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,540
<1-10,JOEY>肥皂就可以共用
<1-10,JOEY>... but we can use the same soap?

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,800
<1-11,CHANDLER>因为肥皂是肥皂  它会自我清洁
<1-11,CHANDLER>Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,040
<1-12,JOEY>好吧  下一次你洗澡的时候
<1-12,JOEY>Alright, well next time you take a shower,

19

<1-12,JOEY>...think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.

37
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,830

<2-5,JOEY>You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?

38

<2-11,RACHEL>Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,730
<2-12,JOEY>真不错  你们要纹什么
<2-12,JOEY>Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?

44
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,350
<2-13,PHOEBE>我要纹一朵百合
<2-13,PHOEBE>I'm getting a lily.

45
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,130
<2-13,PHOEBE>为了纪念我妈  她就叫百合
<2-13,PHOEBE>For my mom, because her name's Lily.

46
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,750
<2-14,CHANDLER>真幸运  她要是叫大污点怎么办
<2-14,CHANDLER>That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

47
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,360

<2-17,ROSS>What's on your shoulder?

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,740

<2-19,ROSS>Why? Why would you wanna do that?

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,670
<2-20,RACHEL>你不觉得那酷吗
<2-20,RACHEL>You don't think they're kind of cool?

<2-21,ROSS>不  抱歉  我不觉得
<2-21,ROSS>No. Sorry, I don't.

55
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,600
<2-21,ROSS>怎么会有人花钱去搞个一辈子的伤痕
<2-21,ROSS>Why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,250
<2-21,ROSS>万一纹得不理想呢  菲比
<2-21,ROSS>What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe?

57
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,440
<2-21,ROSS>那不就像永远都在"我头发剪坏了"的状态吗
<2-21,ROSS>Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time.

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,430
<2-21,ROSS>都看我干什么
<2-21,ROSS>Why is everyone staring at me?

59

<2-26,MONICA>对  我爸的生日  我决定送他中风
<2-26,MONICA>Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

64
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,830
<2-27,PHOEBE>不  你应该告诉他们
<2-27,PHOEBE>No, I think you should tell them.

<2-28,MONICA>我还不知道他对我有多认真
<2-28,MONICA>No, I don't even know how serious he is about me.

66
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,460
<2-28,MONICA>在搞清楚之前  我什么也不说
<2-28,MONICA>Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.

67
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,680
<2-29,ROSS>也未必吧  我想他们不会介意
<2-29,ROSS>I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind.

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,050
<2-29,ROSS>记得你九岁  理查德三十岁时  爸常说
<2-29,ROSS>Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say

69
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,860
<2-29,ROSS>"天啊  真希望他们在一起"

<4-8,FRIEND>Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.

<7-8,RACHEL>怎么了  是因为罗斯的话吗
<7-8,RACHEL>Is this because of what Ross said?

140
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,300
<7-13,PHOEBE>当时是女人很多事得听男人的时代
<7-13,PHOEBE>When men used to tell women what to do a lot.

141
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,100
<7-13,PHOEBE>然后还有选举权  那是件好事  但听起来很可怕
<7-13,PHOEBE>Then there was suffrage, which was a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

142
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,970
<7-13,PHOEBE>你到底要不要纹

<8-5,RICHARD>听着  或许我们应该说出来
<8-5,RICHARD>Look, maybe we should just tell them.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,720
<8-6,MONICA>或许我们应该先告诉你父母
<8-6,MONICA>Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

158
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,160
<8-7,RICHARD>我父母死了
<8-7,RICHARD>My parents are dead.

159
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,270
<8-8,MONICA>你真幸运
<8-8,MONICA>God, you are so lucky!

160
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,190

<8-12,MRS. GELLER>谢谢  理查德  很感激你的支持
<8-12,MRS. GELLER>Thank you, Richard. I appreciate the support.

165
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,660
<8-13,MR. GELLER>亲爱的
<8-13,MR. GELLER>Honey.

166
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,040

<8-13,MR. GELLER>Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.

167
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,470
<8-14,MRS. GELLER>完全不知道
<8-14,MRS. GELLER>I have no idea.

168
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,590
<8-14,MRS. GELLER>你知道理查德在城里和一个笨丫头交往吗
<8-14,MRS. GELLER>Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

169
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,150
<8-15,MR. GELLER>我知道  他像变了个人一样
<8-15,MR. GELLER>I know. He's like a new man.

170
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,860
<8-15,MR. GELLER>好像进了"魔茧"一样
<8-15,MR. GELLER>It's like a scene from Cocoon.

171
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,830
<8-16,MRS. GELLER>我怎么也无法想象理查德和淫娃在一起
<8-16,MRS. GELLER>I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

172
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,130
<8-17,MR. GELLER>他告诉沙约翰·夏皮罗  那个女孩不错
<8-17,MR. GELLER>Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.

173
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,590
<8-17,MR. GELLER>事实上  他告诉强尼  他觉得自己爱上她了
<8-17,MR. GELLER>In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.

174
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,460
<8-19,MR. GELLER>-真的  -告诉你  我没见他这么快乐过

<8-20,MRS. GELLER>...you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

177
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,050
<8-21,MR. GELLER>当然没有
<8-21,MR. GELLER>Of course not.

178
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,740
<8-21,MR. GELLER>你不就等于两个二五佳人
<8-21,MR. GELLER>With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

179
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,690
<8-22,MRS. GELLER>杰克  住手

<9-1,JOEY>Can we drop this?

183
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,920
<9-1,JOEY>我对那家伙的公寓没兴趣
<9-1,JOEY>I am not interested in the guy's apartment.

184
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,530
<9-2,CHANDLER>别装了  我看到你看他房子装饰的样子
<9-2,CHANDLER>Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.

<9-3,JOEY>Why would I want another apartment?

187
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,000
<9-3,JOEY>我已经有个我爱的公寓了
<9-3,JOEY>I've already got an apartment that I love.

188
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,210
<9-4,CHANDLER>偶尔这样说说又不会死
<9-4,CHANDLER>It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

189
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,290
<9-5,JOEY>好吧  想听实话吗  我的确在考虑
<9-5,JOEY>All right. You want the truth? I'm thinking about it.

190
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,830
<9-6,CHANDLER>-什么  -抱歉
<9-6,CHANDLER>- What? - I'm sorry.

191
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,180
<9-7,JOEY>我今年28了  从没自己住过
<9-7,JOEY>I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone,

192
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,360
<9-7,JOEY>而我终于赚到足够的钱
<9-7,JOEY>and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money

193
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,810
<9-7,JOEY>可以让我不再需要室友
<9-7,JOEY>that I don't need a roommate anymore.

194
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,160
<9-8,CHANDLER>我也不需要室友
<9-8,CHANDLER>I don't need a roommate either.

195
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,690
<9-8,CHANDLER>自己住这里我也负担得起
<9-8,CHANDLER>I can afford to live here by myself.

196
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,120
<9-8,CHANDLER>我或许一个礼拜得请一次人来舔我的餐具
<9-8,CHANDLER>I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.

197
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,040
<9-9,JOEY>你火气怎么那么大
<9-9,JOEY>What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh?

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,680
<9-9,JOEY>我们又没说要永远住在一起
<9-9,JOEY>It's not like we agreed to live together forever.

199
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,130
<9-9,JOEY>我们又不是连体婴
<9-9,JOEY>We're not Bert and Ernie.

202
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,360
<9-12,CHANDLER>那或许你应该搬去
<9-12,CHANDLER>...then maybe you should take it.

203
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,140
<9-12,CHANDLER>-我是那样觉得  -那或许你应该搬去

<11-7,MRS. GELLER>我是在想  他何不打个电话给摩妮卡
<11-7,MRS. GELLER>I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

219
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,660
<11-8,RICHARD>这主意不错
<11-8,RICHARD>That's an idea.

220
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,490
<11-9,MONICA>事实上  我已经有男友了
