<4-15,JOEY>你相信他们让斯蒂芬妮得皮肤癌吗
<4-15,JOEY>Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?

108
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,320
<4-16,CHANDLER>我还是不敢相信他们升她为副队长
<4-16,CHANDLER>I still can't believe they made her lieutenant!

109
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,730
<4-17,JOEY>你那么说是因为你最喜欢亚斯明·布里斯了
<4-17,JOEY>You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.

110
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,230
<4-18,CHANDLER>怎么可能会有人不爱亚斯明·布里斯
<4-18,CHANDLER>How could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth?

111
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,530
<4-19,JOEY>她们跑起来了

<4-20,CHANDLER>See, this is the brilliance of the show.

113
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,720
<4-20,CHANDLER>她们真应该不停地跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>I say always keep them running.

114
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,850
<4-20,CHANDLER>一个劲地跑
<4-20,CHANDLER>All the time running!

<4-20,CHANDLER>Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

118
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,970
<5-1,MONICA>我以为你想自己一个人住
<5-1,MONICA>But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.

119
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,220
<5-2,JOEY>没错  我以为会很棒
<5-2,JOEY>I did. I thought it'd be great.

120
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,110
<5-2,JOEY>我以为我会有时间自己思考
<5-2,JOEY>I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,950
<5-2,JOEY>但我发觉我的思想没有你们那么多
<5-2,JOEY>But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you think.

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,210
<5-3,PHOEBE>乔伊  你索性跟钱德勒说你想搬回去好了
<5-3,PHOEBE>Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?

123

<6-1,ROSS>我告诉你  他绝对不可能搬回来的
<6-1,ROSS>I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.

128

<11-24,JOEY>Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally.

<11-24,JOEY>You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.

276
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,570
<11-25,CHANDLER>那有什么差别呢  你的蛋已经不在这个地方了
<11-25,CHANDLER>What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they?

277
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,920
<11-25,CHANDLER>你已经带着你的蛋走了
<11-25,CHANDLER>You took your eggs and you left!

278
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,360
<11-25,CHANDLER>你就真以为我不会找到新蛋吗
<11-25,CHANDLER>Did you expect me to never find new eggs?

<12-17,MONICA>闹着玩  这叫好玩吗
<12-17,MONICA>Fun? You think this is fun?

304
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,480
<12-18,ROSS>是啊  我以为我们只是在闹  就像小时候一样
<12-18,ROSS>Yeah, come on, I thought we were fooling around, like when we were kids.

305
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,380
<12-19,MONICA>罗斯  小时候我恨你
<12-19,MONICA>I hated you when we were kids!

306
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,030
<12-20,ROSS>小时候你恨我
<12-20,ROSS>You hated me when we were kids?

308
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,490

<12-21,MONICA>I loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-l-have-to way...

309
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,290
<12-21,MONICA>但从根本上讲  我恨透你了
<12-21,MONICA>... but basically, I hated your guts.

310
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,360
<12-22,ROSS>你为什么要恨我
<12-22,ROSS>Why did you hate me?

311
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,740
<12-23,MONICA>因为你对我太刻薄了
<12-23,MONICA>Because you were mean to me...

312
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,110
<12-23,MONICA>你嘲弄我  还总是横行霸道
<12-23,MONICA>...and you teased me and you always got your way.

313
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,380
<12-24,ROSS>你觉得那不好玩
<12-24,ROSS>That wasn't fun for you?

314

<12-26,ROSS>真不敢相信你恨过我
<12-26,ROSS>I can't believe you hated me.

315
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,780
<12-27,MONICA>可现在我爱你
<12-27,MONICA>But now I love you.

316
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,010
<12-27,MONICA>不只是因为我们有血缘关系
<12-27,MONICA>And not just because I have to.

<12-30,ROSS>I can do that.

320
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,570
<12-31,MONICA>那我就用不着杀你了
<12-31,MONICA>Then I won't have to kill you.

321
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,700
<12-32,ROSS>你要看《娱乐今宵》吗
<12-32,ROSS>So you wanna watch Entertainment Tonight?.

<12-33,MONICA>- You know what? - What?

324
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,370
<12-35,MONICA>如果你真的想看那个节目  也可以
<12-35,MONICA>If you really wanna watch that Serengeti thing, we can.

325
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,540
<12-35,MONICA>好吧
<12-35,MONICA>O.K.

326
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,260
<13-3,PHOEBE>听着  你们绝对不会相信的
<13-3,PHOEBE>Listen, you are not going to believe this...

327
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,270
<13-3,PHOEBE>那卷录像带上的歌声不是我的
<13-3,PHOEBE>...but that is not me singing on the video.

328
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,420
<13-5,PHOEBE>-不是吧  -是真的
<13-5,PHOEBE>- No. - Yes.

329
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,070
<13-6,RACHEL>你怎么发现的
<13-6,RACHEL>How did you find out?

330
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,760
<13-7,PHOEBE>唱片公司送了一张纸条来  叫我签名  要我同意
<13-7,PHOEBE>O.K. The record company sent over this paper for me to sign saying it's okay...

331
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,650
<13-7,PHOEBE>他们找别人代唱  这是第一条线索
<13-7,PHOEBE>...for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.

332
