00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,280
<2-3,CHANDLER>等他们踢完足球后
<2-3,CHANDLER>After they're done playing,

41
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,760
<2-3,CHANDLER>我会把小塑胶妞拿出来

<2-7,CHANDLER>just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.

48
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,760
<2-8,PHOEBE>那也许是因为  你没花时间去了解他
<2-8,PHOEBE>Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him.

49
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,850
<2-8,PHOEBE>我们来补救  好不好

151
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,680
<6-9,JOEY>也让编剧有了面子
<6-9,JOEY>which makes the writers look good

152
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,230
<6-9,JOEY>他们怎么可能会生我的气呢

166
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,090
<9-1,MONICA>如果你考虑到全世界有多少男人的话
<9-1,MONICA>I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are,

167
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,300
<9-1,MONICA>那个比例是非常小的
<9-1,MONICA>it's a very small percentage.

<9-10,RICHARD>just a ballpark.

185
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,800
<9-11,MONICA>反正肯定比一个棒球场的人数要少
<9-11,MONICA>Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.

186
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,860
<9-12,RACHEL>真庆幸现在我不是莫妮卡

<9-22,RACHEL>Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.

199
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,150
<9-22,RACHEL>那只能算是无意义的野兽般的性关系
<9-22,RACHEL>All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex.

200
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,830
