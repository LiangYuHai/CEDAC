<5-27,CHANDLER>谁叫你多嘴呢
<5-27,CHANDLER>You had to ask.

187
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,940
<6-4,PHOEBE>我只是觉得这是个很不好的预兆
<6-4,PHOEBE>I just think that this was a really bad sign.

188
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,200
<6-4,PHOEBE>像是门槛上的野兽啦
<6-4,PHOEBE>Like the beast at the threshold.

189
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,970
<6-4,PHOEBE>我已经没有别的亲人了
<6-4,PHOEBE>It's just I have like no family left, ya know.

190
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,510
<6-4,PHOEBE>除了我外婆之外
<6-4,PHOEBE>except for my grandmother.

191
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,430
<6-4,PHOEBE>可是面对现实吧  她又不会永远都活着
<6-4,PHOEBE>But let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever.

192
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,660
<6-4,PHOEBE>虽然她说她会
<6-4,PHOEBE>Despite what she says.

<6-4,PHOEBE>我有个姐姐
<6-4,PHOEBE>And I have a sister who

194
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,770
<6-4,PHOEBE>但共住一个子宫后  几乎就没说过话了
<6-4,PHOEBE>I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.

195
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,750
<6-2,PHOEBE>这是我的亲生父亲
<6-2,PHOEBE>I don't know. This is my real father...

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,330
<6-4,PHOEBE>我只是希望能一切完美
<6-4,PHOEBE>and I just, I want things to be like just right.

202
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,670
<6-9,JOEY>我猜现在门槛安全了
<6-9,JOEY>I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

<7-3,JOEY>你错过了  "钱生钱"
<7-3,JOEY>You missed "Takes money to make money"

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,460
<7-3,JOEY>还有  "别逼我过去踢你的华尔街屁股"
<7-3,JOEY>and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."

209
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,100

<7-5,JOEY>I had breakfast here,

211
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,370
<7-5,JOEY>所以技术上讲我省了三块半
<7-5,JOEY>so technically I saved $3.50.

212
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,900
<7-6,RACHEL>你怎么赚十七块的
<7-6,RACHEL>How did you make $17?

213
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,400
<7-7,MONICA>我的金融白痴朋友
<7-7,MONICA>Well, my financially challenged friends

214
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,930

<7-8,JOEY>How come those?

216
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,900
<7-9,MONICA>CHP是因为我暗恋过埃里克·埃斯特拉达
<7-9,MONICA>Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.

218
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,450
<7-9,MONICA>ZXY  因为听起来很"劲"感
<7-9,MONICA>And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."

219
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,840

<7-11,MONICA>MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

221
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,880
<7-11,MONICA>我的座右铭是  "在疲软以前撤退"
<7-11,MONICA>My motto is, "Get out before they go down."

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,670
<10-21,FRANK>没有  不过他一向沉默是金啦
<10-21,FRANK>No, but he didn't really talk about anything.

335
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,110
<10-22,PHOEBE>除了高跷
<10-22,PHOEBE>Except stilts.

<10-24,PHOEBE>-高跷   -对啊  他爱高跷

338
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,210
<10-25,FRANK>偷我妈包里的香烟
<10-25,FRANK>I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse

339
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,760
<10-25,FRANK>突然间我望了一下

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,830
<10-25,FRANK>看到我爸的头从窗外一上一下地经过
<10-25,FRANK>and there's my Dad's head, bobbing past the window.

341
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,660
<10-25,FRANK>他脸上满是笑意  还冲我挥手
<10-25,FRANK>He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving

342
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,500
<10-25,FRANK>因为他踩高跷的时候
<10-25,FRANK>'cause he was always happiest

343
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,770
<10-25,FRANK>就是他最高兴的时候
<10-25,FRANK>when he was on his stilts.

<10-28,PHOEBE>我根本不会踩那玩意儿
<10-28,PHOEBE>I don't know what to do with that.
