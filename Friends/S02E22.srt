<1-3,MONICA>怎么了
<1-3,MONICA>What?

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,990

<1-4,ROSS>Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,550
<1-5,MONICA>你想掌管食物委员会吗
<1-5,MONICA>You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,370
<1-6,ROSS>问题二  为什么每次派对都要有食物委员会
<1-6,ROSS>Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?

8

<1-8,ROSS>Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,500
<1-9,PHOEBE>真心高档次的人才玩得开心
<1-9,PHOEBE>if you're fancy on the inside

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,470
<1-9,PHOEBE>我们又不是这种人
<1-9,PHOEBE>and I'm just not sure we are.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,510
<1-10,MONICA>好吧  你们不想要特别的  随便
<1-10,MONICA>Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine.

<2-1,ROSS>我跟瑞秋的妹妹讲了  她们都不能来
<2-1,ROSS>I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.

35

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,990
<2-4,PHOEBE>为什么呢
<2-4,PHOEBE>Why not her?

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,650
<2-5,JOEY>因为她  偷东西
<2-5,JOEY>Cause she uh, she steals stuff.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,340
<2-6,CHANDLER>又或许她不会偷东西
<2-6,CHANDLER>Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,050
<2-6,CHANDLER>乔伊跟她上床后  就没再打电话给她了
<2-6,CHANDLER>and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.

42
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,610
<2-7,MONICA>乔伊  你太过分了
<2-7,MONICA>Joey that is horriable.

43
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,690
<2-8,JOEY>我喜欢她  好吗
<2-8,JOEY>Hey I liked her, alright.

44
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,390
<2-8,JOEY>或许太喜欢了  我不知道
<2-8,JOEY>Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,310
<2-8,JOEY>我想我只是害怕了
<2-8,JOEY>I guess I just got scared.

46

<2-9,PHOEBE>抱歉  我不知道
<2-9,PHOEBE>I'm sorry, I didn't know.

47
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,140
<2-10,JOEY>没想到有人会吃这一套
<2-10,JOEY>I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.

<2-12,RACHEL>如同地狱的毕业典礼一般
<2-12,RACHEL>Agh, it was the graduation from hell.

50
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,330
<2-13,CHANDLER>我表弟靠着足球奖学金进了地狱
<2-13,CHANDLER>Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

51
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,810
<2-14,RACHEL>这本来应该是个快乐的场合
<2-14,RACHEL>Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,230
<2-14,RACHEL>我妹妹从大学毕业了  谁也没想到
<2-14,RACHEL>My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,260
<2-14,RACHEL>真正证明了
<2-14,RACHEL>It's a true testament to

54
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,040
<2-14,RACHEL>一个长岛女孩为了一辆跑车会做什么
<2-14,RACHEL>what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,570

<2-16,RACHEL>My parents happened.

57
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,130
<2-16,RACHEL>他们只需要坐在同一个体育馆
<2-16,RACHEL>All they had to do was sit in the same stadium,

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,730
<2-16,RACHEL>骄傲地微笑  绝口不提离婚的事
<2-16,RACHEL>smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce.

59
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,690
<2-16,RACHEL>但不  毕业典礼致词到一半时
<2-16,RACHEL>But nooo, they got into a huge fight

60
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,290
<2-16,RACHEL>他们就吵得不可开交了
<2-16,RACHEL>in the middle of the commencement address.

61

<6-111,MR. GREENE>I even got a governor.

327
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,310
<6-111,MR. GREENE>就这样了  是不是
<6-111,MR. GREENE>This is it, isn't it?

328
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,020
<7-1,RACHEL>我的生活就会变成这样了
<7-1,RACHEL>I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.

329
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,590
<7-1,RACHEL>我妈跟我爸一人一个地方
<7-1,RACHEL>My mom there, my dad there.

330
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,000
<7-1,RACHEL>感恩节  圣诞节
<7-1,RACHEL>Thanksgiving, Christmas.

331
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,030
<7-1,RACHEL>她得到房子
<7-1,RACHEL>She gets the house,

332
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,140
<7-1,RACHEL>他住在公寓  我妹打算用柳条家具帮他布置
<7-1,RACHEL>he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.

333
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,850
<7-1,RACHEL>钱德勒  你是怎么熬过来的
<7-1,RACHEL>Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?

334
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,890
<7-2,CHANDLER>我依靠的是精心策划的计划
<7-2,CHANDLER>Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program

335
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,590
<7-2,CHANDLER>拒绝面对现实
<7-2,CHANDLER>of denial

336
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,800
<7-2,CHANDLER>还有尿床
<7-2,CHANDLER>and, and wetting the bed.

337
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,760
<7-3,RACHEL>这太奇怪了
<7-3,RACHEL>Ya know, I just, so weird.

338
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,500
<7-3,RACHEL>我在里面  听着他们两个人骂来骂去
<7-3,RACHEL>I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other

339
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,690
<7-3,RACHEL>可是心里却一直在想着国庆日
<7-3,RACHEL>and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.

340
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,200
<7-4,CHANDLER>因为那让你想起我们的先辈
<7-4,CHANDLER>Becasue it reminded you of the way

341
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,250
<7-4,CHANDLER>从前也是骂来骂去吗
<7-4,CHANDLER>our forefathers used to bitch at each other?

342
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,600
<7-5,RACHEL>是这样的  我们每年都会坐我爸的船出海
<7-5,RACHEL>It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat

343
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,330
<7-5,RACHEL>去看烟火
<7-5,RACHEL>and watch the fireworks.

344
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,950
<7-5,RACHEL>我妈总是讨厌去
<7-5,RACHEL>Mom always hated it

345
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,030
<7-5,RACHEL>因为海风会把她的头发吹膨
<7-5,RACHEL>because the ocean air made her hair all big.

346
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,790
<7-5,RACHEL>我妹妹吉尔  则会靠在船边呕吐
<7-5,RACHEL>My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side

347
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,330
<7-5,RACHEL>我爸会生气  因为没有人帮他忙
<7-5,RACHEL>and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping

348
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,500
<7-5,RACHEL>当我们帮忙时  他又会大吼说我们越帮越忙
<7-5,RACHEL>and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong.

349
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,110
<7-5,RACHEL>但是当烟火开始后  大家都闭嘴了
<7-5,RACHEL>But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up,

350
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,700
<7-5,RACHEL>然后会变得很冷
<7-5,RACHEL>you know, and it'd get really cold,

351
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,050
<7-5,RACHEL>我们会全部挤在一条毯子下面
<7-5,RACHEL>and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket.

352
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
<7-5,RACHEL>从来没有人想到要多带一条来
<7-5,RACHEL>It never occured to anybody to bring another one.

353
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,380
<7-5,RACHEL>但是现在
<7-5,RACHEL>And now it's just...

354
