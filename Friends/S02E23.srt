00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,170
<2-3,RICHARD>还是全城最胖的小子
<2-3,RICHARD>or the fattest man in the whole damn town?

63
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,990

64
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,120
<2-4,MONICA>就会叫《胖小子李洛布朗》了

69
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,780
<2-9,RICHARD>那你重新铺是因为...
<2-9,RICHARD>Then, you're redoing it because...

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,400

74
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,300
<2-12,MONICA>应该在床的右下角才对
<2-12,MONICA>it should be at the bottom right corner.

75
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,990
<2-13,RICHARD>这不算很疯狂
<2-13,RICHARD>Oh, well that's not so crazy.

126
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,480

128
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,510
<5-9,PHOEBE>因为我外婆没出过水痘
<5-9,PHOEBE>'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox.

<5-12,RYAN>我会抓住那小子  整个人在我脸上蹭
<5-12,RYAN>I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.

136
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,790
<5-13,PHOEBE>或许你也可以希望  我现在没出水痘
<5-13,PHOEBE>Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.

137
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,610
<5-14,RYAN>我可以看你的脸吗
<5-14,RYAN>Can I please see your face?

262
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,340
<9-7,RICHARD>如果不是直角  那就是错角
<9-7,RICHARD>If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

263
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,960
<9-8,MONICA>很好

<9-13,RICHARD>我糊涂了  时间不都是一样的吗
<9-13,RICHARD>Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.

269
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,340
<9-14,MONICA>不  我把房间的时钟调快了六分钟
<9-14,MONICA>No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,250
<9-14,MONICA>想不想知道原因
<9-14,MONICA>You wanna know why?

271
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,880

<9-25,RICHARD>我总是把运动袜  跟西装袜分开来放
<9-25,RICHARD>I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.

283
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,430
<9-26,MONICA>如果搞混了会怎样
<9-26,MONICA>What if they get mixed up?

<9-28,MONICA>真不敢相信我的男朋友没怪癖
<9-28,MONICA>I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

288
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,490
<9-28,MONICA>我的男朋友没有怪癖
<9-28,MONICA>My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

289
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,180
<9-29,RICHARD>如果这话被人听到  别人会怀疑我无能
<9-29,RICHARD>See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.

290
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,690
<10-1,JOEY>道格拉斯先生正在找你
<10-1,JOEY>Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

<10-2,CHANDLER>Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

292
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,730
<10-3,JOEY>因为他怀疑
<10-3,JOEY>'Cause he has a strong suspicion

293
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,920
<10-3,JOEY>你搞砸了那个银行项目

<10-4,CHANDLER>Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?

295
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,720
<10-5,JOEY>因为开始他以为是乔瑟夫的错
<10-5,JOEY>Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph.

296
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,740
<10-5,JOEY>但在问了乔瑟夫之后  发现原来是你
<10-5,JOEY>But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.

297
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,730
<10-5,JOEY>反正我想你应该知道啦
<10-5,JOEY>Anyway, I just thought you should know.

298
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,870
<10-5,JOEY>好吧  够了

<10-6,CHANDLER>Look Joey, I'm sorry,

300
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,410
<10-6,CHANDLER>我知道这是你一生难求的好角色
<10-6,CHANDLER>I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya,

301
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,280
<10-6,CHANDLER>如果可以只开除乔瑟夫  我会的
<10-6,CHANDLER>and if I could just fire Joseph, I would,

302
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,110
<10-6,CHANDLER>但不幸的是  这不可能  所以
<10-6,CHANDLER>but unfortunately that's not possible so

303
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,940
<10-6,CHANDLER>我必须要你们两个一起走人
<10-6,CHANDLER>I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

304
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,840
<10-7,JOEY>你在胡扯什么  大家都爱乔瑟夫
<10-7,JOEY>What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.

305
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,440
<10-8,CHANDLER>我不爱  我恨乔瑟夫
<10-8,CHANDLER>I don't, I hate Joseph, ok.

306
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,720
<10-8,CHANDLER>我认为他是个马屁精
<10-8,CHANDLER>I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.

307
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,830
<10-9,JOEY>是吗  你不能开除乔瑟夫
<10-9,JOEY>Oh yeah? Well you can't fire Joseph.

308
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,340
<10-9,JOEY>知道为什么吗  因为他不在你的部门
<10-9,JOEY>You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.

309
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,030
<10-10,CHANDLER>好吧  我不能开除乔瑟夫
<10-10,CHANDLER>Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph

354
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,600
<12-6,MONICA>是因为我必须睡床的这一边
<12-6,MONICA>because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

355
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,690
<12-7,RICHARD>还是因为我让你这么以为呢
<12-7,RICHARD>Or so I would have you believe.

356
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,310
<12-8,MONICA>没什么大不了的  你喜欢睡床的一边
<12-8,MONICA>No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed,

357
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
<12-8,MONICA>每个人都有自己喜欢的一边
<12-8,MONICA>everybody has a side of the bed.

361
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,820

362
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,710
<12-11,RICHARD>睡东边的话  海洋的方向就错了
