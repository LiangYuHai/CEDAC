125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,040
<4-13,MONICA>你的幻想中  墙角有没有小小的摇篮
<4-13,MONICA>Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

126
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,930
<4-14,RICHARD>猎犬吗
<4-14,RICHARD>Like a hound?

127
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,990
<4-15,MONICA>不是猎狗  是摇篮
<4-15,MONICA>Not a basset, a bassinet.

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,750
<4-16,RICHARD>你真的需要摇篮吗
<4-16,RICHARD>You really need the bassinet?

129
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,330

<4-17,MONICA>Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.

131
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,000

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,870

<5-13,PHOEBE>她说"HH"是什么意思
<5-13,PHOEBE>What does she mean by HH?

157
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,870
<5-14,CHANDLER>那就表示我们在牵手了
<5-14,CHANDLER>It means we're holding hands.

<5-16,CHANDLER>I'm afraid I might just be.

<5-17,PHOEBE>or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.

163
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,960
<5-18,CHANDLER>她不是男的  好吗  我知道她不是
<5-18,CHANDLER>Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

<5-20,JOEY>What's going on?

168
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,350
<5-21,PHOEBE>我们正在猜  钱德勒的女友是不是女的
<5-21,PHOEBE>We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

169
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,330
<5-22,JOEY>那问她会活多久就可以了
<5-22,JOEY>Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

170
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,850
<5-22,JOEY>女人比男人长寿
<5-22,JOEY>Women live longer than men.

171
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,550
<5-23,CHANDLER>你还真是笨得到家了
<5-23,CHANDLER>How do you not fall down more?

172
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,930
<5-24,PHOEBE>你问她现在用什么方法避孕
<5-24,PHOEBE>Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

173
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,580
<5-24,PHOEBE>好吧
<5-24,PHOEBE>All right.

174
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,180
<5-25,CHANDLER>"我丈夫跟他的秘书有婚外情"
<5-25,CHANDLER>"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

175
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,590
<5-27,CHANDLER>她结婚了
<5-27,CHANDLER>She's married!

176
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,250
<5-26,PHOEBE>至少我们知道她是个女的
<5-26,PHOEBE>Well at least we know she's a woman.

177
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,340
<5-27,CHANDLER>我真不敢相信她结婚了
<5-27,CHANDLER>I can't believe she's married.

178
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,360
<5-28,JOEY>老兄  真遗憾
<5-28,JOEY>Aw, man I'm sorry.

179
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,100
<5-28,JOEY>你心里一定很难受吧
<5-28,JOEY>This must be very tough for ya, huh .

180
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,560
<6-1,MONICA>我那天看到一篇文章说
<6-1,MONICA>So, I read this article the other day

181
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,910
<6-1,MONICA>不应该在婚礼上丢米庆祝
<6-1,MONICA>that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings,

182
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,910
<6-1,MONICA>因为鸽子吃了会死掉
<6-1,MONICA>because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

183
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,460
<6-2,RICHARD>难怪寿司店里都看不到鸽子
<6-2,RICHARD>Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

184
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,220
<6-2,RICHARD>你瞧  我们很开心
<6-2,RICHARD>See, we're having fun.

185
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,460
<6-3,MONICA>是啊
<6-3,MONICA>Oh, absolutely.

186
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,470
<6-3,MONICA>我根本连想都不想
<6-3,MONICA>Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing

187
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,090
<6-3,MONICA>我们不要去想的那件事
<6-3,MONICA>that we're not supposed to think about.

188
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,000
<6-4,RICHARD>我也没想
<6-4,RICHARD>Neither am I.

189
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,270
<7-1,ROSS>你还好吗
<7-1,ROSS>Are you all right?

190
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,750
<7-2,RACHEL>我去上洗手间的时候
<7-2,RACHEL>Yeah, when I was in the bathroom

191
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,180
<7-3,ROSS>看到我结婚时  爬出去的那扇窗子
<7-3,ROSS>I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God,

192
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,740
<7-4,RACHEL>然后我开始想  我不该来的
<7-4,RACHEL>I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
<7-4,RACHEL>大家会打量我  评判我
<7-4,RACHEL>people are going to be looking at me and judging me and,

194
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,860
<7-4,RACHEL>然后就想到上一次的事
<7-4,RACHEL>and thinking about the last time.

195
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,010
<7-5,ROSS>亲爱的  你不会有事的
<7-5,ROSS>Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right.

196
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,980
<7-5,ROSS>这是场婚礼  通常大家都只会注意新娘子
<7-5,ROSS>It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.

197
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,230
<7-6,RACHEL>天啊  我知道你说得对

<8-2,ROSS>对不起  我该怎么做
<8-2,ROSS>I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do

207
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,100
<8-2,ROSS>难不成站起来大叫

208
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,730
<8-2,ROSS>"瑞秋  你的屁股露出来了"

210
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,360
<8-3,RACHEL>我想唯一比这个还要丢脸的
<8-3,RACHEL>I think the only thing that tops that was, was,

211
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,070
<8-3,RACHEL>就是我初三时
<8-3,RACHEL>was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing

212
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,230
<8-3,RACHEL>在全校面前唱  《古巴卡巴那》那次了

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,790
<8-3,RACHEL>我大概没唱两句就逃之夭夭了
<8-3,RACHEL>I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,940
<8-3,RACHEL>天啊  我悲惨的人生再现眼前
<8-3,RACHEL>Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

<10-3,MONICA>You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

276
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,190
<10-3,MONICA>我以为我需要  只是因为社会的问题
<10-3,MONICA>You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society,

277

<10-8,BEST MAN>No, no, no now in all seriousness,

292
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,590
<10-8,BEST MAN>没有多少女人有胆量  今晚回来这里
<10-8,BEST MAN>it's not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

293
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,710
<10-8,BEST MAN>而且还敢露屁股回来的  那就更少了
<10-8,BEST MAN>and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

294
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,580
<10-9,ROSS>我想补充几句
<10-9,ROSS>Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

295
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,810
<10-10,RACHEL>为什么要补充...
<10-10,RACHEL>Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

296
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,070
<10-11,ROSS>你们大半都不认识我
<10-11,ROSS>Most of you don't know me,

297
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,760
<10-11,ROSS>我是瑞秋的男朋友
<10-11,ROSS>I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

298
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,780
<10-12,RACHEL>老天
<10-12,RACHEL>Oh dear God.

299
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,320
<10-13,ROSS>我叫罗斯  我想说
<10-13,ROSS>Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say

300
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,840
<10-13,ROSS>瑞秋真的是鼓足了勇气  今晚来到这里
<10-13,ROSS>that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

301
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,620
<10-13,ROSS>而且  我想澄清
<10-13,ROSS>And, uh, just for the record

302
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,340
<10-13,ROSS>瑞秋并不是因为得了梅毒才逃婚的
<10-13,ROSS>she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

303
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,330
<10-13,ROSS>搞什么  我可没开玩笑
<10-13,ROSS>What are you doing I'm serious.

304
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,660
<10-13,ROSS>她离开巴瑞的原因  其实很简单
<10-13,ROSS>Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that

305
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,060
<10-13,ROSS>她并不爱他  所以呢  成就了我的美事
<10-13,ROSS>she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me.

306
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,400
<10-14,RACHEL>咱们停车场见
<10-14,RACHEL>See you in the parking lot.

307
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,620
<10-15,ROSS>瑞秋
<10-15,ROSS>No, Rach!

308
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,410
<10-16,BARRY>她又再一次离开了  谁赌9点45分的
<10-16,BARRY>And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?

309
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,510
<10-17,RACHEL>知道吗  巴瑞  我不会走的
<10-17,RACHEL>You know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

310
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,340
<10-17,RACHEL>我大概应该走  但是我不走
<10-17,RACHEL>I probably should, but I'm not,

311
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,760
<10-17,RACHEL>因为我答应自己  至少要
<10-17,RACHEL>see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through

312
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,230

<10-17,RACHEL>at least one of your weddings.

313
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,930
<10-17,RACHEL>今晚  其实我只想要
<10-17,RACHEL>See now, tonight, all I really wanted was

<10-17,RACHEL>grace and dignity.

316
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,430
<10-17,RACHEL>我想我们都同意  那是不可能的了
<10-17,RACHEL>Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

317
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,650
<10-17,RACHEL>我想也没什么好说的了
<10-17,RACHEL>There's nothing really left to say

318
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,940
<10-17,RACHEL>除了
