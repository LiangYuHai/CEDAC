55
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,720
<2-14,Phoebe>是啊  所以我们从不叫你一起玩
<2-14,Phoebe>Yep. And that's why we don't invite you to play.

56
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,020

<4-12,Ross>And that's bad because...

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,870
<4-12,Ross>你不喜欢吃鸡肉
<4-12,Ross>you hate chicken piccata?

126
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,410
<4-13,Chandler>不是
<4-13,Chandler>No.

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,730
<4-14,Ross>你不想把番茄分给人家
<4-14,Ross>You didn't want to share your tomatoes.

128
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,470
<4-14,Ross>因为番茄对你很重要
<4-14,Ross>Tomatoes are very important to you.

129
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,670
<4-15,Chandler>不  因为突然间  我们就成"情侣"了
<4-15,Chandler>No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this "couple." Okay?

130
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,300
<4-15,Chandler>然后我脑袋里的警报开始大响
<4-15,Chandler>And this alarm started going off in my head, you know,

131
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,240
<4-15,Chandler>"为了你的人生  快跑快离开这栋大楼!"
<4-15,Chandler>"Run for your life! Get out of the building!"

132
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,330
<4-16,Rachel>男人真是令人难以置信
<4-16,Rachel>Men are unbelievable.

133
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,830
<4-17,Monica>你们这些人是怎么回事
<4-17,Monica>What is it with you people?

134
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,420
<4-17,Monica>心中一旦产生感情就要马上逃开
<4-17,Monica>I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?

135
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,580
<4-18,Chandler>我知道  那就是...
<4-18,Chandler>I know. That...

136
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,430
<4-18,Chandler>就是我今晚不想去的原因
<4-18,Chandler>That's why I don't want to go tonight.

137
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,380
<4-18,Chandler>我怕自己说出一些蠢话
<4-18,Chandler>I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.

138
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,500
<4-19,Monica>你是说男人那套故意冷漠  保持距离
<4-19,Monica>You mean that "guy thing" where you act mean and distant...

139
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,190
<4-19,Monica>直到我们跟你们分手
<4-19,Monica>until you get us to break up with you?

140
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,010
<4-20,Joey>嘿  你知道这招
<4-20,Joey>Hey, you know about that?

141
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,750
<4-21,Chandler>我该怎么做  我想克服它
<4-21,Chandler>Look what do I do? I wanna get past this.

142
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,020
<4-21,Chandler>我不想再害怕承诺
<4-21,Chandler>I don't want to be afraid of the commitment thing.

143
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,910
<4-21,Chandler>我想穿过隧道到达胜利的彼岸
<4-21,Chandler>I want to go through the tunnel to the other side!

144
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,050
<4-22,Ross>就是指不再害怕承诺
<4-22,Ross>Where there's no fear of commitment.

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,620
<4-23,Chandler>你们有没有
<4-23,Chandler>Do we have any...

146
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,040
<4-23,Chandler>你们有什么办法吗
<4-23,Chandler>Do we have any thoughts here?

147
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,060
<4-23,Chandler>我没穿过那种隧道啦
<4-23,Chandler>Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself...

148
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,160
<4-24,Joey>因为据我所知
<4-24,Joey>'cause as I understand it,

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
<4-24,Joey>车里多于一个女生
<4-24,Joey>you're not allowed to go through

150
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,860
<4-24,Joey>是不能通过隧道的  对吧
<4-24,Joey>with more than one girl in the car, right.

151
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,000
<4-24,Joey>但我想这和战胜其他问题
<4-24,Joey>But it seems to me it's pretty much

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,110
<4-24,Joey>是一个道理  直面恐惧
<4-24,Joey>like anything else, you know. Face your fear.

153
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,290
<4-24,Joey>你怕高的话  就站到大楼顶上
<4-24,Joey>You have a fear of heights? You go to the top of the building.

154
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,660
<4-24,Joey>如果你怕虫子
<4-24,Joey>You're afraid of bugs.

155
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,980
<4-24,Joey>就去捉只虫玩玩
<4-24,Joey>Get a bug.

156
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,310
<4-24,Joey>你的情况是害怕承诺...
<4-24,Joey>In this case, you have a fear of commitment.

157
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,580
<4-24,Joey>那你就按时赴约
<4-24,Joey>So I say you go in there

158
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,850
<4-24,Joey>做最勇于承诺的男人
<4-24,Joey>and you be the most committed guy there ever was!

159
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,030
<4-25,Rachel>令人惊讶的是  说的还真有道理
<4-25,Rachel>Amazingly, that makes sense.

160
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,950
<4-26,Chandler>-你这么觉得  -是啊  快去吧  老兄
<4-26,Chandler>- You think? - Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

<4-27,Joey>Jump off the high dive!

162
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,660

<4-28,Chandler>Yeah, Joe, I assure you

164
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,890
<4-28,Chandler>如果让我直面枪口...
<4-28,Chandler>if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun,

165
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,920
<4-28,Chandler>我大概已经尿得到处都是了
<4-28,Chandler>I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.

<6-12,Chandler>但事到临头好像也没什么大不了
<6-12,Chandler>And now that I'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?

228
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,700
<6-12,Chandler>或许就算我说  "我们同居吧"
<6-12,Chandler>I mean, I could probably say, "Let's move in together, "

229
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,940
<6-12,Chandler>我还是能接受得了
<6-12,Chandler>and I'd be okay.

230
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,170
<6-13,Janice>你可能想跟我一起住吗
<6-13,Janice>You probably want us to move in together?

231
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,650
<6-14,Chandler>-我竟然不害怕  -是啊  但我怕了
<6-14,Chandler>- lt doesn't scare me! - Yeah, well it scares me!

232
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,110
<6-15,Janice>我还没离婚呢
<6-15,Janice>I'm not even divorced yet!

233
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,230
<6-15,Janice>钱德勒  你只是邀请我来吃意大利面
<6-15,Janice>Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta,

234
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,210
<6-15,Janice>而现在你突然提到要住在一起的事
<6-15,Janice>and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together.

235
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,060
<6-15,Janice>我其实还不是很饿
<6-15,Janice>And I wasn't even that hungry.

236
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,630
<6-15,Janice>话说时间有点晚了  我最好先...
<6-15,Janice>You know what? It's getting really late, and I should just...

237
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,600
<6-16,Chandler>别走  我吓着你了  我说太多了
<6-16,Chandler>Oh, No, don't go! I've scared you! I've said too much!

238
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,800
<6-16,Chandler>对于爱情  我是无药可救的笨拙
<6-16,Chandler>I'm hopeless and awkward

239
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,460
<6-16,Chandler>却又充满渴望
<6-16,Chandler>and desperate for love!

240
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,050
<6-16,Chandler>珍妮斯  是我
<6-16,Chandler>Hey, Janice, it's me.

241
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,670
<6-16,Chandler>我只是想在去街上追你之前
<6-16,Chandler>Yeah, I, I just wanted to apologize in advance

242
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,780
<6-16,Chandler>先跟你道歉
<6-16,Chandler>for having chased you down the street.

243
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,060
<7-1,Rachel>宝贝  吃点这个  你会好受点
<7-1,Rachel>Here you go, honey. This will help.

244
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,710
<7-2,Chandler>我终于追上了她  然后她说...
<7-2,Chandler>So I finally catched up to her and she says

245
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,760
<7-2,Chandler>这段感情发展太快  我们得放慢脚步
<7-2,Chandler>this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.

246
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,350
<7-4,Monica>这样绝不是好现象
<7-4,Monica>That is never good.

247
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,590
<7-5,Chandler>于是我就变得...
<7-5,Chandler>Then I got all...

248
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,970
<7-5,Chandler>空虚又黏人
<7-5,Chandler>needy and clingy.

249
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,820
<7-6,Rachel>等等  或许不算太糟  你们怎么结束的
<7-6,Rachel>Wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?

250
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,980
<7-7,Chandler>她说她会再打给我
<7-7,Chandler>She said she'd call me.

251
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,610
<7-9,Chandler>天呐
<7-9,Chandler>Oh, God.

252
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,150
<7-10,Monica>欢迎来到隧道我们这头
<7-10,Monica>Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

253
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,550
<7-11,Chandler>对了  这个冰淇淋难吃死了
<7-11,Chandler>This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.

254
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,710
<7-12,Rachel>因为这是低卡无奶豆浆制的冒牌货
<7-12,Rachel>Well, that's that low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

255
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,090
<7-12,Rachel>真货要留到实在无法挽留了再吃
<7-12,Rachel>We sort of, we save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.

256
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,670
<7-13,Monica>如果一直这么糟
<7-13,Monica>You know, when you're getting screwed over all the time,

257
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,280
<7-13,Monica>就给他换成低脂的
<7-13,Monica>you gotta switch to low fat.

258
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,320
<7-14,Rachel>就这么定了
<7-14,Rachel>Yeah, you do.

259
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,730
<7-15,Chandler>你觉得还有挽留的机会
<7-15,Chandler>You don't think I'm terminal?

260
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,270
<7-16,Monica>当然有机会  只是要防止事情恶化
<7-16,Monica>Not at all. You're not terminal. We just need some damage control.

261
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,220
<7-17,Chandler>-好  我该打电话给她吗?  -不
<7-17,Chandler>- Okay, okay. Should I call her? - No.

262
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,160
<7-18,Rachel and Monica>这段时间很重要
<7-18,Rachel and Monica>Very critical time, right now.

263
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,920
<7-19,Rachel>一旦你发现自己的双手又伸向了电话...
<7-19,Rachel>If you feel yourself reaching for that phone...

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,560
<7-19,Rachel>你就去买鞋子  不然就洗个泡泡浴
<7-19,Rachel>you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath.

265
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,430
<7-19,Rachel>你若希望她回来  就给我表现得冷漠点
<7-19,Rachel>If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.

266
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,330
<7-20,Monica>她必须知道你并不空虚
<7-20,Monica>She has to know you're not needy.

267
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,520
<7-21,Rachel>所以你要做的就是
<7-21,Rachel>Right, so what you have to do is...

268
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,510
<7-21,Rachel>假装不经意地碰到她
<7-21,Rachel>you have to accidentally run into her on purpose...

269
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
<7-21,Rachel>然后表现得很冷漠
<7-21,Rachel>and then act aloof.

270
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,870
<7-22,Chandler>这样我就不会失去她了
<7-22,Chandler>So I'm not gonna lose her?

271
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,730
<7-23,Rachel>亲爱的  你可不完全是个失败者
<7-23,Rachel>Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.

272
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,120
<7-24,Chandler>我问的是  "我就不会失去她了"
<7-24,Chandler>I said, "So I'm not gonna lose her?"

273
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,480
<8-1,Ross>看看谁来了
<8-1,Ross>Guess who's here!

274
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,690
<8-1,Ross>是玩具王国里最勇敢的人  本
<8-1,Ross>It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

275
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,840
<8-1,Ross>真正的美国英雄  我是美国大兵
<8-1,Ross>Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe!

276
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,620
<8-1,Ross>把芭比娃娃放下  把芭比娃娃放下
<8-1,Ross>Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

277
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,150
<8-1,Ross>美国大兵
<8-1,Ross>G.I. Joe?

278
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,280
<8-1,Ross>你真觉得他会喜欢那玩意儿
<8-1,Ross>You really think he'll fall for that?

279
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,290
<8-1,Ross>美国大兵
<8-1,Ross>G.I. Joe?

280

<8-2,Joey>好棒  我可以玩吗
<8-2,Joey>Cool! Can I play?

281
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,160
<8-3,Ross>本  你看  这个玩具保护了美国海外石油权
<8-3,Ross>Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!

282
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,430
<8-4,Joey and Ross>加油  大兵
<8-4,Joey and Ross>Go, Joe!

283
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,690

<8-6,Joey>- Phoebe, there you are! - No, it's not. Sorry.

<8-7,Phoebe>菲比  等等  等等  菲比
<8-7,Phoebe>But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe!

285
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,910
<8-9,Phoebe>乔伊啊  我刚没认出你来...
<8-9,Phoebe>Oh, Joey! Oh, okay! See, I didn't recognize you...

286
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,420
<8-9,Phoebe>因为你穿着这条裤子
<8-9,Phoebe>...in those pants.

287
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,090
<8-10,Joey>我参加试镜的电视电影有什么回应吗
<8-10,Joey>That TV movie I went in for, did you hear anything?

288
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,170
<8-10,Joey>我想我应该机会很大的
<8-10,Joey>I think I got a shot at it.

289
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,820
<8-11,Phoebe>对  他们打来了你没有入选
<8-11,Phoebe>Yes, they called! You didn't get it!

290
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,030
<8-11,Phoebe>我是说你落选了  对不起  很抱歉
<8-11,Phoebe>Okay? I mean, you didn't get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

291
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,060
<8-12,Joey>没关系  这种事时有发生
<8-12,Joey>That's okay. These things happen.

292
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,080
<8-13,Phoebe>但是不应该发生的  你知道吗
<8-13,Phoebe>But they shouldn't happen. You know what?

293
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,070
<8-13,Phoebe>你这行很不好混
<8-13,Phoebe>You're in a terrible, terrible business.

294
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,830
<8-13,Phoebe>天啊  我不想成为
<8-13,Phoebe>Oh, God. I don't want to be the person

295
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,180
<8-13,Phoebe>那个让你难过的人
<8-13,Phoebe>who makes your face look like that.

296
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,670
<8-14,Joey>我没事的  你看
<8-14,Joey>I'm, I'm okay. See?

297
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,000
<8-15,Phoebe>你现在变得又难过又吓人了
<8-15,Phoebe>Now you're sad and creepy.

298
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,540
<8-15,Phoebe>-我很抱歉  我要辞职  我不干了  -不
<8-15,Phoebe>- You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay, I just quit. - No.

<8-16,Joey>No, no, you can't quit!

300
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,470
<8-16,Joey>你是我遇到过最好的经纪人
<8-16,Joey>You're the best agent I ever had.

301
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,830
<8-16,Joey>当演员被拒绝是家常便饭
<8-16,Joey>Look, Pheebes, rejection is part of being an actor.

302
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,520
<8-16,Joey>你不要看做是针对你的
<8-16,Joey>You can't take it personal.

303
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,620
<8-17,Phoebe>不是针对你吗
<8-17,Phoebe>Not personal? Really?

304
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,550
<8-17,Phoebe>他们说从没遇过一个意大利演员
<8-17,Phoebe>They said they'd never met an ltalian actor

305
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,170
<8-17,Phoebe>有着如此糟糕的意大利腔
<8-17,Phoebe>with a worse ltalian accent.

306
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,770
<8-18,Joey>他们真的这么说
<8-18,Joey>They actually said that?

307
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,940
<8-19,Phoebe>天啊  又是那种表情  我做不了这份工作
<8-19,Phoebe>Oh, God, there's that face again. See? I can't do this job!

308
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,600
<8-20,Joey>这就是为何你必须得做这份工作
<8-20,Joey>No, no, this is why you have to do this job!

309
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,200
<8-20,Joey>经纪人都说谎
<8-20,Joey>Agents always lie.

310
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,410
<8-20,Joey>艾丝特尔总是说  "他们有新想法了"
<8-20,Joey>You know, Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way."

311
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,230
<8-20,Joey>但你这样诚实  我才能改进嘛
<8-20,Joey>But this? I can use this.

312
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,630
<8-20,Joey>我可以学一种新的腔调
<8-20,Joey>I can work on a new accent.

313
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,220
<8-21,Phoebe>好  若对你有帮助就好
<8-21,Phoebe>Yeah, okay. If it helps you, okay. Yeah.

314
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,570
<8-22,Ross>你抓不到我的  士兵
<8-22,Ross>You'll never get me, Joe!

315
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,740
<9-1,Janice>不用了  谢谢
<9-1,Janice>No, thank you.

316
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,860
<9-2,Chandler>-钱德勒  -你好  珍妮斯

<9-6,Chandler>不  再也不会了
<9-6,Chandler>No, Not anymore.

322
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,210
<9-7,Janice>你怎么来这买东西  你又不住在这一带
<9-7,Janice>Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.

323
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,200
<9-7,Janice>你是不是在这里等我
<9-7,Janice>Were you here waiting for me?

324
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,890

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,720
<9-9,Janice>什么样的派对会上大麦
<9-9,Janice>What kind of party serves barley?

329
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,120
<9-10,Chandler>很抱歉  我的朋友没你朋友那么有水准
<9-10,Chandler>I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.

330
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,830
<9-11,Janice>派对在哪举行
<9-11,Janice>Where is this party?

331
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,170

<9-14,Chandler>一个女人
<9-14,Chandler>A woman's.

334
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,520

336
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,750
<9-17,Janice>好吧  这种事发生只有两种可能
<9-17,Janice>OK, you know, one of two things is happening here.

337
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,850
<9-17,Janice>你不是背着我跟别人约会
<9-17,Janice>Either you're seeing somebody behind my back...

338
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,250
<9-17,Janice>若这样你就是世界第一混蛋
<9-17,Janice>which would make you the world's biggest jerk on the planet...

339
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,490
<9-17,Janice>否则就是你假装跟别人约会
<9-17,Janice>or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody...

340
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,980
<9-17,Janice>那你就是可悲
<9-17,Janice>which makes you so pathetic

341
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,770
<9-17,Janice>我会当即在这麦片货架区为你哭泣
<9-17,Janice>I could cry right here in the cereal aisal!

342
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,340
<9-17,Janice>这两种男人  你想当哪一种
<9-17,Janice>So which of these two guys do you want to be?

343
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,530
<9-18,Chandler>我可以当那个人吗
<9-18,Chandler>Can I be that guy?

344
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,230
<10-1,Phoebe>我们收到了更多善意的拒绝
<10-1,Phoebe>Okay, we got some more good rejections.

345
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,490
<10-1,Phoebe>有很多地方要改进
<10-1,Phoebe>Lots of stuff to work on.

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,380
<10-2,Joey>好  说吧
<10-2,Joey>Okay. Shoot.

347
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,830
<10-3,Phoebe>好  那个动物园广告
<10-3,Phoebe>Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.

348
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,180
<10-4,Joey>我没得到那个角色
<10-4,Joey>I didn't get it?

349
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,720
<10-5,Phoebe>他们说你"简直不像人类"
<10-5,Phoebe>No, they said that you "weren't believable as a human being."

350
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,440
<10-5,Phoebe>所以你可以针对这一点改进
<10-5,Phoebe>So you can work on that.

351
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,020
<10-5,Phoebe>很好
<10-5,Phoebe>Okay.

352
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,010
<10-6,Joey>还有呢
<10-6,Joey>What else?

353
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,460
<10-7,Phoebe>那些小剧场的人说你"长得好看但脑瓜子笨"
<10-7,Phoebe>The off-Broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb."

354
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,400
<10-9,Phoebe>等等  不好意思  他们说的是"非常笨"
<10-9,Phoebe>Oh, no wait. I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb."

355
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,180
<10-10,Joey>这没关系  真的没关系
<10-10,Joey>Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.

356
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,940
<10-10,Joey>听着
<10-10,Joey>Look...

357
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,300
<10-10,Joey>我很感谢你  菲比
<10-10,Joey>I really appreciate this Pheebs...

358
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,710
<10-10,Joey>但我觉得还是找回艾丝特尔比较好
<10-10,Joey>but I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.

359
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,980
<10-12,Joey>别误会  你当经纪人当得比她好
<10-12,Joey>Well, don't get me wrong. You're a better agent than she is...

360
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,090
<10-12,Joey>但至少我跟着她
<10-12,Joey>... but at least with her,

361
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,680
<10-12,Joey>我这极蠢的脑袋还保得住
<10-12,Joey>I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

362
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,880
<10-13,Phoebe>是的  我能理解
<10-13,Phoebe>Yeah, no, I understand.

363
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,770
<10-14,Joey>-真的吗  谢谢你  -嗯
<10-14,Joey>- You do? Thanks. Okay. - Yeah.

364
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,700
<10-15,Phoebe>抱歉
<10-15,Phoebe>Sorry.

365
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,120
<10-16,Joey>-等等  -干嘛
<10-16,Joey>- Wait a minute. - What?

366
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,260
<10-16,Joey>等一下
<10-16,Joey>Wait a minute.

367
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,850
<10-18,Joey>你是不是故意编出来的
<10-18,Joey>Did you make all that stuff up

368
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,560
<10-18,Joey>这样就不用当我的经纪人了
<10-18,Joey>to get out of being my agent?

369
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,650
<10-19,Phoebe>被你发现了
<10-19,Phoebe>Oh, he caught me.

370
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,280
<10-19,Phoebe>我被当场揭穿了
<10-19,Phoebe>I am so busted!

371
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,690
<10-20,Joey>我早就这么怀疑了
<10-20,Joey>That's what I suspected!

372
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,470
<11-1,Chandler>然后我只好...
<11-1,Chandler>And then I just, you know...

373
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,090
<11-1,Chandler>把一袋大麦丢到她身上  然后逃出了那家店
<11-1,Chandler>...threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.

374
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,860
<11-2,Monica>天啊  我们叫你扮冷酷  不是扮蠢材
<11-2,Monica>My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof, " not "a doof."

375
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
<11-3,Chandler>我这次真的搞砸了  对吧
<11-3,Chandler>I've actually ruined this, haven't I?

376
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,050
<11-3,Chandler>这次可以吃真正的冰淇淋了吗
<11-3,Chandler>Is it time for the good ice cream now?

377
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,970
<11-4,Rachel>是该吃了
<11-4,Rachel>Yeah, it is.

378
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,480
<11-5,Monica>一切都会好起来的
<11-5,Monica>You know what? Everything's gonna be okay.

379
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,150
<11-5,Monica>你好

<11-7,Rachel>我怎么知道  这是史无前例的
<11-7,Rachel>How should I know? I mean, this is totally unprecedented.

383
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,000
<11-8,Monica>若我们做出像你一样的事
<11-8,Monica>If we did what you did,

384
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
<11-8,Monica>男人绝不会再打来了
<11-8,Monica>a man would never call.

385
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,360
<11-10,Chandler>我知道了  假装你刚睡醒
<11-10,Chandler>I got it! I got it! Pretend you just woke up.

386
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,670
<11-11,Monica>这样就会打击到她
<11-11,Monica>That'll throw her off!

387
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,460
<11-12,Rachel>-迷迷糊糊的  -对  还有小暴躁
<11-12,Rachel>- Be sleepy! - Yes! And grumpy!

388

<11-13,Chandler>我知道我最近的表现很怪
<11-13,Chandler>I know I've been acting really weird lately...

392
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,560
<11-13,Chandler>那是因为我太爱你了
<11-13,Chandler>and it's just because I'm crazy about you...

393
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:16,180
<11-13,Chandler>我就变得很蠢  又很害怕
<11-13,Chandler>and I just got stupid and scared...

394
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,890
<11-13,Chandler>然后还蠢了好几回
<11-13,Chandler>and stupid a couple of more times.

395
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,900
<11-13,Chandler>我很抱歉

<11-14,Rachel>He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...

399
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,260
<11-14,Rachel>她现在已经跟别人上床了
<11-14,Rachel>she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,750
<11-15,Chandler>我也爱你
<11-15,Chandler>I love you too.

401
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,100

<12-2,Susan>What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

<12-3,Ross>Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

406
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,310
<12-3,Ross>如果你们不能接受  那你们就太糟糕了
<12-3,Ross>And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.

407
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,400
<12-4,Monica>你干嘛这么小家子气
