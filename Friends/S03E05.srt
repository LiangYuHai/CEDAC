<12-36,Phoebe>她不是妓女
<12-36,Phoebe>She's not a hooker.

<13-2,Joey>Why don't we just go on 2?

294
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,680
<13-3,Chandler>为什么要数到二
<13-3,Chandler>Why 2?

295
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,330
<13-4,Joey>这样比较快
<13-4,Joey>Because it's faster.

<13-5,Chandler>要不是你啰哩叭嗦
<13-5,Chandler>Yeah, I could've counted to 3

297
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,280
<13-5,Chandler>早就数到三了
<13-5,Chandler>like four times without all the "2" talk.

298
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,610
<13-7,Joey>-好吧  但是以后...  -好了  够了

<13-16,Chandler>是啊  大得连我的门都看不见了
<13-16,Chandler>Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!

305
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,790
<13-17,Joey>可能是我的尺子有问题
<13-17,Joey>Maybe my ruler's wrong.

306
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,720
<13-18,Phoebe>可能所有尺子都有问题
<13-18,Phoebe>Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

307
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,860
<13-19,Joey>其实还好嘛
<13-19,Joey>It's not that bad.

308
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,400
<13-19,Joey>你的挡一点 我的挡一点
<13-19,Joey>So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.

309

<13-20,Chandler>我有个更好的主意
<13-20,Chandler>Yeah. You know what, I got a better idea.

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,230
<13-20,Chandler>干脆不要挡我的门  都去挡你的
<13-20,Chandler>How about it blocks none of my door, and a lot of your door?

311
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,050
<13-21,Joey>先说一声  那边的油漆还没干
<13-21,Joey>Listen, before I forget, that side is still wet.
