63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,080
<2-18,Chandler>他居然说  "哇  好短的留言啊"

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,160
<2-24,Ross>我想我终于搞清楚了
<2-24,Ross>You know I think I finally figured out

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,990
<2-24,Ross>我们最近总闹别扭的原因

<2-26,Ross>"Susan" something.

75
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,730

81
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,290

<9-8,Joey>I'm such a jerk.

237
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,810
<9-8,Joey>没关系
<9-8,Joey>It's okay.

238
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,400
<9-9,Monica>任何人都会碰上这种事
<9-9,Monica>I suppose it could happen to anyone.

239
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,190
<9-9,Monica>我不认识这种人  不过...
<9-9,Monica>Not anyone I know, but....

240
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,340
<9-9,Monica>我还是看得到
<9-9,Monica>By the way, I can still see it.

241
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,370
<10-1,Monica>菲比
<10-1,Monica>Pheebs?

<10-3,Monica>Where's your bed?

243
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,150
<10-4,Phoebe>不在屋里吗
<10-4,Phoebe>It's not in the apartment?

244
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
<10-4,Phoebe>不是吧
<10-4,Phoebe>No.

245
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,870
<10-4,Phoebe>居然又发生这种事了
<10-4,Phoebe>I can't believe this is happening again.

246
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:00,380
<10-6,Phoebe>-什么  -好吧  别拷问我了
<10-6,Phoebe>- What? - Okay, enough with the third degree!

247
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,020
<10-8,Phoebe>我...  我不住这里了
<10-8,Phoebe>I-I, I don't live here anymore.

248
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,110
<10-7,Monica>-你在说什么  -对不起
<10-7,Monica>- What are you talking about? - I'm sorry.

249
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,810
<10-8,Phoebe>我...  我不住这里了
<10-8,Phoebe>I-I-I, I don't live here anymore.

250
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,490
<10-8,Phoebe>我不知道该怎么告诉你
<10-8,Phoebe>I didn't know how to tell you.

251
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,630
<10-8,Phoebe>但是其他人都知道
<10-8,Phoebe>But, you know, everybody else knows.

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,180
<10-9,Monica>大家都知道
<10-9,Monica>Everybody knows?

253
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,660
<10-10,Phoebe>这本来是好事  但是我忘了原因
<10-10,Phoebe>That was supposed to be a good thing. I forget why.

254
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,570
<10-10,Phoebe>莫妮卡  我...
<10-10,Phoebe>Monica, I...

255
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,070
<10-10,Phoebe>知道吗  我曾经一整个月睡不着
<10-10,Phoebe>Do you know, okay, do you know I couldn't sleep for like a month

256
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,330
<10-10,Phoebe>就因为一个沙发靠垫  被我沾上了一滴墨水
<10-10,Phoebe>because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?

257
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,560
<10-11,Monica>你可以把它翻面啊
<10-11,Monica>You could've just turned the cushion over.

258
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,680
<10-12,Phoebe>我也想啊  但另一面沾上了意大利面酱汁
<10-12,Phoebe>I would have, except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.

259
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,510
<10-13,Monica>什么
<10-13,Monica>What?

260
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,630
<10-14,Phoebe>我就是这个意思
<10-14,Phoebe>Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

261
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,180
<10-14,Phoebe>我要住在可以打翻东西的地方
<10-14,Phoebe>I need to live in a land where people can spill!

262
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,210
<10-15,Monica>你可以打翻东西啊
<10-15,Monica>Well, you can spill.

263
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,730
<10-15,Monica>在水槽里
<10-15,Monica>In the sink.

264
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,270
<10-16,Phoebe>亲爱的  不是你不好  你就是这样的人
<10-16,Phoebe>Oh, honey. It's not your fault, you know. This is who you are.

265
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,820
<10-16,Phoebe>我爱你  我想跟你做朋友
<10-16,Phoebe>And I love you. And I want us to be friends.

266
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,480
<10-16,Phoebe>要是我继续住这里  那是不可能的
<10-16,Phoebe>And if I keep living here, I don't see that happening.

267
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,860
<10-17,Monica>-我也爱你  -那就好
<10-17,Monica>- I love you too. - Good.

268
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,950
<10-18,Phoebe>怎么了
<10-18,Phoebe>What?

269
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,810
<10-19,Monica>什么  我只是很难过
<10-19,Monica>What? I'm just sad.

270
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,490
<10-20,Phoebe>才怪  你在想是哪一个垫子
<10-20,Phoebe>No, you're not. You're wondering which cushion it is.

271
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,450
<11-1,Chandler>在看什么
<11-1,Chandler>So what are you watching?

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,770
<12-8,Monica>我不懂
<12-8,Monica>I don't understand.

291
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,280
<12-8,Monica>我真的这么难相处吗
<12-8,Monica>Am I so hard to live with?

292
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,990
<12-8,Monica>所以才找不到男朋友吗
<12-8,Monica>Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

293
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,470
<12-9,Chandler>不是  你没有男朋友是因为...
<12-9,Chandler>No, you don't have a boyfriend because....

294
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,170
<12-9,Chandler>我不知道为什么
<12-9,Chandler>I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.

295
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,460
<12-9,Chandler>你应该有男朋友的
<12-9,Chandler>You should have a boyfriend.

296
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,790
<12-10,Monica>我也这么认为
<12-10,Monica>I think so.

<12-11,Chandler>Listen, you are one of my favorite people

300
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,920
<12-11,Chandler>还是我在现实中所认识的  最漂亮的女人
<12-11,Chandler>and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.

301
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,420
<13-1,Ross>人都在哪里
<13-1,Ross>Where is everybody?

302

<13-2,Phoebe>已经关门了  克里斯要我锁门
<13-2,Phoebe>It's already closed. Chris gave me the keys to lock up.

303
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,650
<13-2,Phoebe>出了什么事
<13-2,Phoebe>What is wrong?

304
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,520
<13-3,Ross>我想我的婚姻
<13-3,Ross>My marriage, I think my marriage is...

305
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,040
<13-3,Ross>应该是完蛋了
<13-3,Ross>...is kind of over.

306
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,240
<13-4,Phoebe>不会吧  为什么
<13-4,Phoebe>Oh, no! Why?

307
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,490
<13-4,Phoebe>因为卡罗尔是个女同性恋
<13-4,Phoebe>Because Carol's a lesbian.

308
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,090
<13-5,Ross>而我不是
<13-5,Ross>And I'm not one.

309
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,180
<13-5,Ross>而且这显然不是一时兴起混搭一下
<13-5,Ross>And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.

310
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,660
<13-5,Ross>天哪
<13-5,Ross>Oh, my God!

311
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,440
<13-6,Phoebe>我真不敢相信
<13-6,Phoebe>I don't believe it!

312
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,310
<13-6,Phoebe>可怜的孩子
<13-6,Phoebe>Oh, you poor bunny.

313
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,060
<13-7,Ross>我是白痴
<13-7,Ross>I'm an idiot.

314
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,720
<13-7,Ross>我早该看出来了
<13-7,Ross>I should have seen it.

315
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,390
<13-7,Ross>卡罗尔和我出门时
<13-7,Ross>I mean, Carol and I would be out,

316
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,270
<13-7,Ross>她总喜欢盯着漂亮姑娘看
<13-7,Ross>and she'd see some beautiful woman...

317
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,900
<13-7,Ross>她会说  "罗斯  你看她"
<13-7,Ross>...and she'd be "Ross! Look at her!"

318
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,460
<13-7,Ross>我还觉得
<13-7,Ross>And I'd think...

319
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,620
<13-7,Ross>天哪  我老婆真酷
<13-7,Ross>"God, my wife is cool."

320
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,390
<13-8,Phoebe>你觉得那个苏珊是她的情人吗
<13-8,Phoebe>Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,920
<13-9,Ross>我现在知道了
<13-9,Ross>Well, now I do!

322
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,700
<13-10,Phoebe>对不起
<13-10,Phoebe>I'm sorry.

<13-11,Ross>她是唯一爱过我的女人
<13-11,Ross>She's the only woman who's ever loved me.

326
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,550

<13-11,Ross>She's the only woman I've ever....

327

341
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,780
<15-1,Ross>要是我再温柔体贴一些  或是
<15-1,Ross>if I'd been more nurturing or...

342
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,560
