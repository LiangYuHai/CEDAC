1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,240
<1-1,Rachel>菲比  来了
<1-1,Rachel>Here you go, Pheebs.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,730
<1-1,Rachel>谁要吃我的特制巧克力蛋糕
<1-1,Rachel>Who else wants one of my special home-baked brownies?

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,970
<1-2,Chandler>-我要一块  -我要
<1-2,Chandler>- I will have one. - I do.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,350
<1-3,Chandler>-算了  -不要了
<1-3,Chandler>- That's okay. - I'm not having one.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,060
<1-4,Ross>不是  是我牙痛
<1-4,Ross>No, no. It's just my tooth.

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,080
<1-6,Chandler>-好  -我要一块
<1-6,Chandler>- All right. - I'll have one.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,310
<1-7,Ross>怎么了  你要看牙医吗
<1-7,Ross>So what's matter? You need a dentist?

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,500
<1-7,Ross>我认识一个好医生
<1-7,Ross>I've got a good one.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,380
<1-8,Phoebe>谢了  我也认识一个  只是我不能见他
<1-8,Phoebe>Thanks. I have a good one too. I just can't see him.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,260
<1-9,Chandler>这就是隐形牙医的问题
<1-9,Chandler>See, that is the problem with invisible dentists.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,250
<1-10,Ross>你为什么不能去找他
<1-10,Ross>Why can't you go to him?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,330
<1-11,Phoebe>因为我每次去看牙医  就会有人死
<1-11,Phoebe>Because every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,500
<1-12,Chandler>真诡异  我每次去看牙医
<1-12,Chandler>That is so weird. Because every time I go to the dentist...

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,930
<1-12,Chandler>都会偷看医生的胸口
<1-12,Chandler>I look down the hygienist's blouse.

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,620
<1-13,Rachel>菲比  你说什么
<1-13,Rachel>Phoebe, what...?

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,400
<1-13,Rachel>什么
<1-13,Rachel>What?

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,260
<1-14,Phoebe>是啊  第一次是玛丽阿姨
<1-14,Phoebe>Yeah! First, it was my Aunt Mary.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,820
<1-14,Phoebe>然后是我的邮差约翰
<1-14,Phoebe>And then there was John, my mailman.

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,640
<1-14,Phoebe>然后是我的牛仔朋友  艾拜诺·巴伯
<1-14,Phoebe>And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,550
<1-15,Rachel>这些人真的都死了吗
<1-15,Rachel>And all these people actually died?

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,640
<1-16,Phoebe>对  当我坐在诊疗椅上时
<1-16,Phoebe>Yes. While I was in the chair.

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,320
<1-16,Phoebe>所以我都自己保健牙齿
<1-16,Phoebe>That's why I take such good care of my teeth now.

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,100
<1-16,Phoebe>不是为了口腔卫生  我用牙线是为了救人
<1-16,Phoebe>You know, it's not about oral hygiene. I floss to save lives.

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,680
<1-17,Ross>菲比  拜托  你没有杀人
<1-17,Ross>Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody.

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,320
<1-17,Ross>只是这些人死的时候  你刚好去看牙医
<1-17,Ross>These people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,850
<1-17,Ross>这只是巧合
<1-17,Ross>It's just a coincidence.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,740
<1-18,Phoebe>你去跟他们说啊  哦不行  他们都死了
<1-18,Phoebe>Tell that to them. Oh, you can't! They're dead!

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,460
<2-1,Ross>甘瑟  谢了
<2-1,Ross>Thanks, Gunther.

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,500
<2-1,Ross>可以给一张纸巾吗
<2-1,Ross>Can I get a napkin too?

45
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
<2-2,Gunther>你还不够称心如意吗
<2-2,Gunther>Like you don't already have everything.

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,820
<2-4,Rachel>菲比  你痛得很厉害
<2-4,Rachel>Pheebe, you're in pain.

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,030
<2-4,Rachel>去看牙医吧  快去吧
<2-4,Rachel>Would you just go to the dentist. Just go.

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,320
<2-5,Phoebe>好  但如果你是下一名受害者
<2-5,Phoebe>Alright, fine. But if you're my next victim...

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,760
<2-5,Phoebe>别化身成厉鬼跑回来  把我吸进电视里
<2-5,Phoebe>don't come back as a poltergeist who sucks me into the TV set.

50
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,440
<2-6,Rachel>保证不会
<2-6,Rachel>I promise.

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,460
<2-7,Phoebe>但还是欢迎你来找我
<2-7,Phoebe>Although, don't feel like you can't visit.

52
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,960
<2-8,Joey>钱德勒在吗
<2-8,Joey>Hey, is Chandler here?

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,370
<2-9,Ross>不在
<2-9,Ross>No. No, he's not.

54
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,410
<2-10,Monica>乔伊看到珍妮斯跟前夫接吻
<2-10,Monica>You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.

55
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,510
<2-11,Ross>什么
<2-11,Ross>What?

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,630
<2-11,Ross>你要怎么办  要怎么告诉钱德勒
<2-11,Ross>So what are you gonna do? How are you gonna tell Chandler?

57
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,960
<2-12,Joey>我一直在想这件事  最好的办法就是
<2-12,Joey>I was thinking about that. I think the best way would be...

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,710
<2-12,Joey>不要说
<2-12,Joey>to not.

59
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,460
<2-13,Rachel>乔伊  你不能保密
<2-13,Rachel>Joey, you can't keep this to yourself.

60
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,100
<2-13,Rachel>既然你知道了  就得告诉他
<2-13,Rachel>If you know about this, you have to tell him.

61
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,320
<2-14,Joey>那他就完了  真的完了
<2-14,Joey>It'll kill him. I mean it'll just kill him.

62
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,960
<2-15,Phoebe>等我去看牙医吧
<2-15,Phoebe>Well, you can wait until I go to the dentist.

63
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,290
<2-15,Phoebe>或许我会了结他
<2-15,Phoebe>Maybe I'll kill him.

64
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,410
<3-1,Joey>丑裸男在睡吊床
<3-1,Joey>Ugly Naked Guy's using his new hammock.

65
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,640
<3-1,Joey>好像培乐多玩具猪肉工厂
<3-1,Joey>It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

66
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,980
<3-2,Phoebe>我要去看牙医了  听我说
<3-2,Phoebe>I'm going to the dentist. So listen okay?

<3-3,Ross>Some kids messed up the Homo sapien display.

75
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,320
<3-4,Joey>怎么个闹法
<3-4,Joey>What did they do?

76
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,560
<3-5,Ross>他们将名字涂改得只剩"Homo"(即同性恋)
<3-5,Ross>They painted over the word "sapien, " for one thing.

77
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,130
<3-5,Ross>然后又把人偶重新排列  这个就不说了
<3-5,Ross>Then they rearranged the figures. Let's just leave it at that.

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,410

238
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,550
<9-9,Rachel>他好得不得了
<9-9,Rachel>He's never been better.

239
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,590
<9-10,Ross>你们带他去捕鲸了吗
<9-10,Ross>What did you do, take him whaling?

240
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,630
<9-11,Ben>莫妮卡
<9-11,Ben>Monica.

241
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,490

<9-12,Ross>That's great! Good job, Ben!

243
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,100
<9-13,Ben>莫妮卡  砰
<9-13,Ben>Monica bang!

244
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,940
<9-14,Monica>没错
<9-14,Monica>That's right.

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,800
<9-14,Monica>那就是我爆炸的声音
<9-14,Monica>That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.

246
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,970
<9-15,Phoebe>诅咒解除了  我联络了所有认识的人
<9-15,Phoebe>The curse is broken! I called everybody I know...

247
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,090
<9-15,Phoebe>大家都活着
<9-15,Phoebe>and everyone is alive!

248
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,130
<9-17,Phoebe>怎么了
<9-17,Phoebe>What?

249
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,500
<9-18,Joey>丑裸男一动也不动
<9-18,Joey>Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

250
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,680
<10-1,Phoebe>天哪  我杀了他  我又杀了一个人
<10-1,Phoebe>Oh my God, I killed him, I killed another one!

251
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
<10-1,Phoebe>诅咒变强了
<10-1,Phoebe>And this curse is getting stronger too,

252
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,630
<10-1,Phoebe>那么胖的人也害得死
<10-1,Phoebe>to bring down something that big.

253
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,420
<10-2,Rachel>也许他只是在睡觉
<10-2,Rachel>Maybe he's just taking a nap.

254
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,940
<10-3,Joey>错不了的  他从早上开始就没动过
<10-3,Joey>I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.

255
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,590
<10-4,Monica>我们应该求援
<10-4,Monica>We should call somebody.

256
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,330
<10-5,Ross>怎么说
<10-5,Ross>And tell them what?

257
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,890
<10-5,Ross>说我们一直偷窥的裸男不动了
<10-5,Ross>The naked guy we stare all the time isn't moving?

258
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,150
<10-6,Rachel>我们得弄清楚他的死活
<10-6,Rachel>We've got to find out if he's alive.

259
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,720
<10-7,Monica>怎么弄清楚  根本没办法
<10-7,Monica>How are we gonna do that? There's no way.

260
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,510
<10-8,Joey>有一个办法
<10-8,Joey>Well, there is one way.

261
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,500
<10-8,Joey>他的窗子开着  我建议
<10-8,Joey>His window's open. I say...

262
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,340
<10-8,Joey>我们戳他
<10-8,Joey>we poke him.

263
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,460
<11-1,Joey>记得我们每次叫中国菜都会留筷子
<11-1,Joey>Hey, you know how we save all those chopsticks...

264
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,130
<11-1,Joey>又不知道为什么吗
<11-1,Joey>for no reason when we get Chinese food?

265
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,390
<11-3,Joey>-是的  -现在有用了
<11-3,Joey>- Yeah. - Well, now we got a reason.

266
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,420
<11-4,Chandler>怎么用
<11-4,Chandler>What?

267
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,600
<11-5,Joey>我们要做一个很长的探棒
<11-5,Joey>We're fashioning a very long poking device.

268
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,470
<11-6,Chandler>好的
<11-6,Chandler>All right.

269
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,960
<11-7,Joey>你怎么了
<11-7,Joey>Hey, what's the matter?

270
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,510
<11-8,Chandler>我跟珍妮斯谈过了
<11-8,Chandler>I talked to Janice.

271
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,420
<11-9,Joey>天哪  她要回到他身边吗
<11-9,Joey>Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

272
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,580
<11-10,Chandler>她不知道
<11-10,Chandler>She doesn't know.

273
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,970
<11-10,Chandler>她说她两个都爱
<11-10,Chandler>Says she loves us both.

274
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,410
<11-10,Chandler>今天早上醒来时  我在恋爱
<11-10,Chandler>I woke up this morning, I was in love.

275
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,190
<11-10,Chandler>我很快乐
<11-10,Chandler>I was happy!

276
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,590
<11-10,Chandler>觉得那12个安全套买得不冤枉
<11-10,Chandler>It serves me right for buying that 12-pack of condoms.

277
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,510
<11-10,Chandler>现在连退都不能退  因为收据被她咬烂了
<11-10,Chandler>And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!

278
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,710
<11-11,Joey>你要怎么办
<11-11,Joey>What are you gonna do?

279
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,500
<11-11,Joey>不知道
<11-11,Joey>I don't know.

280
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,660
<11-12,Chandler>你会怎么办
<11-12,Chandler>You know? What would you do?

281
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,780
<11-13,Joey>我的做法不重要
<11-13,Joey>It doesn't matter what I'd do.

282
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,700
<11-14,Chandler>别这样  说嘛
<11-14,Chandler>Come on. Come on. Tell me.

283
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,930
<11-14,Chandler>好吧  你...

<11-15,Joey>probably not gonna want to hear this but...

285
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,200
<11-15,Joey>如果是我  这纯属个人意见
<11-15,Joey>if it was me, and this is just me I would...

286
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,620
<11-15,Joey>我会退出
<11-15,Joey>I would bow out.

287
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,580
<11-15,Joey>什么
<11-15,Joey>What?

288
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,040
<11-16,Chandler>你在说什么
<11-16,Chandler>What are you talking about?

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,690
<11-17,Joey>他们有一个孩子
<11-17,Joey>They have a kid together,

290
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,180
<11-17,Joey>你懂吗
<11-17,Joey>you know?

291
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,830
<11-17,Joey>他们是一家人
<11-17,Joey>They're, like, a family.

292
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,380
<11-17,Joey>如果  我不知道
<11-17,Joey>And if, I don't know...

293
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,940
<11-17,Joey>如果他们有机会破镜重圆
<11-17,Joey>if there's a chance they can make that work...

294
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,860
<11-17,Joey>我肯定我不会想当那个障碍
<11-17,Joey>I know I wouldn't wanna be the guy who stood in the way there.

295
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,320
<11-17,Joey>你还好吧
<11-17,Joey>You okay?

<11-17,Joey>You wanna come poke a nude guy?

297
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,450
<12-1,Ross>他终于睡着了
<12-1,Ross>Well, he's finally asleep.

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,830
<12-1,Ross>他头上那个肿包
<12-1,Ross>About that bump on his head...

299
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,300
<12-2,Rachel>你确定那是新的吗
<12-2,Rachel>Are you sure it's a new bump?

300
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,760
<12-2,Rachel>我没有恶意  但我一直觉得
<12-2,Rachel>No offense, but I've always thought

301
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,660
<12-2,Rachel>本总是满头包
<12-2,Rachel>of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,050
<12-3,Ross>撞到头也没关系  小孩子经常撞到头
<12-3,Ross>It's okay if he bumps his head. Kids bump their heads all the time.

303
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,020
<12-3,Ross>你第一次照顾他
<12-3,Ross>You know, it was your first time babysitting.

304
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,690
<12-3,Ross>你已经尽力了
<12-3,Ross>For you you did the best you could.

<12-4,Rachel>I know.

307
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,600
<12-5,Ross>不过你得随时盯着
<12-5,Ross>I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.

308
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,500
<12-6,Rachel>我有  我盯得很紧
<12-6,Rachel>I did! I watched! I watched!

309
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,830
<12-6,Rachel>我眼睁睁看着莫妮卡撞到他的头
<12-6,Rachel>I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!

310
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,720
<12-7,Ross>是莫妮卡撞的
<12-7,Ross>Monica did it?

311
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,950
<12-9,Monica>莫妮卡  你有没有发现
<12-9,Monica>Monica, did you notice anything

312
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,050
<12-10,Ross>本今天怪怪的
<12-10,Ross>weird about Ben today?

313
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,870
<12-11,Monica>没有  怎么了
<12-11,Monica>No, why?

314
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,010
<12-12,Ross>我刚才在陪他玩
<12-12,Ross>I was just playing with him,

315
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,990
<12-12,Ross>我们唱了"字母歌"
<12-12,Ross>and we were doing the "Alphabet Song"

316
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,590
<12-12,Ross>他一向很会唱  今天却漏了E和F
<12-12,Ross>which he used to be good at. Suddenly, he's leaving out E and F.

317
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,220
<12-12,Ross>仿佛那两个字母从脑子里掉了出来
<12-12,Ross>It's like they just, I don't know, fell out of his head.

318
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,570
<12-13,Monica>真的
<12-13,Monica>Really?

319
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,910
<12-14,Ross>还有  他走起路来
<12-14,Ross>And also, he's walking...

320
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,490
<12-14,Ross>不太对劲
<12-14,Ross>kind of funny.

321
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,100
<12-14,Ross>似乎左脚
<12-14,Ross>I mean, it's like his left leg

322
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,520
<12-14,Ross>动得比右脚快
<12-14,Ross>is moving a lot faster than his right leg.

323
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,320
<12-14,Ross>他一直在里面  就像这样
<12-14,Ross>Yeah, he's in there, just sort of, you know...

324
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,520
<12-15,Monica>天哪  我害了你的儿子
<12-15,Monica>Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

325
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,740
<12-16,Rachel>希望你下了地狱还会觉得好玩
<12-16,Rachel>I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.

326
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,710
<12-17,Monica>混蛋
<12-17,Monica>You jerk!

<12-17,Monica>You know how much I love that kid!

328
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,540
<12-18,Ross>莫妮卡  砰  莫妮卡  砰
<12-18,Ross>Monica bang! Monica bang!

<13-1,Chandler>because it's...

333
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,410
<13-1,Chandler>要说出口并不容易
<13-1,Chandler>it's not gonna be easy.

<13-3,Chandler>我觉得你应该回到盖瑞身边
<13-3,Chandler>I think you should go back with Gary.

336
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,000
<13-3,Chandler>我不想当拆散家庭的人
<13-3,Chandler>I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.

337
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,160
<13-3,Chandler>我的父母分手  都是那个男人害的
<13-3,Chandler>You know, my parents split up, it was because of that guy.

338
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,380
<13-3,Chandler>每次见到他  我都会想
<13-3,Chandler>Whenever I would see him, I would always think:

339
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,080
<13-3,Chandler>"是你害他们不能在一起的"
<13-3,Chandler>"You're the reason. You are why they're not together. "

340
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,290
<13-3,Chandler>我恨那个人
<13-3,Chandler>And I hated that guy.

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,950
<13-3,Chandler>不管他人有多好  给我爸带来了多少幸福
<13-3,Chandler>And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.

342
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,460
<13-4,Janice>哇
<13-4,Janice>Wow.
