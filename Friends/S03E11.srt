<4-3,Rachel>"Why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job

82
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,210
<4-3,Rachel>难道就因为这份工作和兴趣有一点点关系吗
<4-3,Rachel>just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?

<6-11,Rachel>原来他是布明岱尔百货的采购助理
<6-11,Rachel>and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's.

125
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,900
<6-11,Rachel>他们的部门要招人
<6-11,Rachel>There happens to be an opening in his department!

<6-14,Ross>那家伙没有任何理由地帮你吗
<6-14,Ross>What? So this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?

131
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,490
<6-16,Ross>你根本不认识他
<6-16,Ross>And he's a total stranger?

<6-17,Rachel>对  他叫"马克"什么的
<6-17,Rachel>Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

133
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,050
<6-18,Ross>看来"马克什么"的不怀好意
<6-18,Ross>Sounds like "Mark Something" wants to have some sex!

134

<6-19,Rachel>什么
<6-19,Rachel>What?

136
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,870
<6-20,Ross>莫名其妙地冒出来
<6-20,Ross>swoop in and out of nowhere for no reason?

<6-22,Ross>Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?

139
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,630
<6-23,Joey>-不会  男人只想上床  -谢谢

<6-24,Ross>So did you tell "Mark Something" about me?

141
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,440
<6-25,Rachel>我用不着提  因为我挂着
<6-25,Rachel>I didn't have to. Because I was wearing...

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,080
<6-25,Rachel>"我爱罗斯"的广告牌  而且一直摇铃铛

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,150
<6-34,Cookie>就是调这种酒来喝
<6-34,Cookie>right after I shot my husband.

<7-2,Chandler>No, it's a good thing.

<7-2,Chandler>我们要快速拨号干嘛  干嘛赶来赶去的
<7-2,Chandler>Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life?

157
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,230
<7-2,Chandler>我们为什么不慢慢享受美好时光
<7-2,Chandler>Why can't we savor the precious moments?

158
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,590
<7-2,Chandler>你胸部好大
<7-2,Chandler>Those are some huge breasts you have!

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,640
<8-3,Ross>我听说瑞秋今天遇到个叫马克的家伙
<8-3,Ross>So I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.

160
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,340
<8-4,Monica>-很棒吧  -是啊
<8-4,Monica>- Isn't it great? - Oh, yeah.

<8-5,Ross>对  是很棒  听起来他是个好人
<8-5,Ross>Yeah, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.

<8-5,Ross>对  他可迷人了
<8-5,Ross>Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy!

163
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,320
<8-6,Monica>他走的时候  我引用了经典的胡言乱语
<8-6,Monica>I mean, when he left, I actually used the phrase:

164
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,330
<8-6,Monica>哈米娜  哈米娜  哈米娜
<8-6,Monica>"Hummina, hummina, hummina."

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,630
<8-7,Ross>太好了
<8-7,Ross>That's excellent.

166
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,840
<9-1,Ross>这么说他只是个大好人罢了
<9-1,Ross>So he's "just a nice guy."

167
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,790
<9-1,Ross>你真的认为这个叫马克的
<9-1,Ross>Do you really think this Mark

168
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,290
<9-1,Ross>是不求回报地帮你吗
<9-1,Ross>doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you?

169
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,390
<9-2,Rachel>我想我得跟他洗鸳鸯浴
<9-2,Rachel>Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.

170
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,480
<9-2,Rachel>不过哪份工作不是这样
<9-2,Rachel>But you know that's true of any job.

171
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,510
<9-3,Monica>你感觉怎么样
<9-3,Monica>How you feeling?

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,540
<9-4,Chandler>我的公寓已经不存在了
<9-4,Chandler>Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...

173
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,480
<9-4,Chandler>因为全被我喝掉了
<9-4,Chandler>because I drank it.

174
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,460
<9-5,Phoebe>你去哪里了  你拆开所有礼物之后就不见了
<9-5,Phoebe>Where'd you get to? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.

175
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,550
<9-7,Chandler>我后来跑到贮藏室  而且不止我一个人
<9-7,Chandler>I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,530
<9-8,All>不要再叫了
<9-8,All>No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."

177
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,830
<9-10,Phoebe>怎么了  发生了什么事

<9-11,Chandler>我上了乔伊的姐妹
<9-11,Chandler>I fooled around with Joey's sister.

179
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,610
<9-11,Chandler>这还不是最糟糕的
<9-11,Chandler>That's not the worst part.

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,330
<9-12,Monica>那最糟糕的是什么
<9-12,Monica>What is the worst part?

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,530
<9-13,Chandler>我不记得是哪个姐妹
<9-13,Chandler>I can't remember which sister.

182
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,090
<9-14,Ross>你看到没有  别说男人有好人
<9-14,Ross>You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.

183
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,650
<9-14,Ross>这就是男人
<9-14,Ross>This is men!

184
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,440

<10-1,Monica>乔伊会杀了你  他真的会把你杀得死死的
<10-1,Monica>I mean, Joey's gonna kill you. He's actually going to kill you dead.

186

<10-2,Chandler>你以为我没想到吗
<10-2,Chandler>Okay, You don't think I thought of that?

187
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,390
<10-3,Phoebe>你怎么会不知道是哪一个
<10-3,Phoebe>How can you not know which one?

188
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,880

<12-1,Ross>嗨  你好吗
<12-1,Ross>Hi, how's it going?

233
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,310
<12-1,Ross>这是我所写过最难以启齿的一封信
<12-1,Ross>This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."

234
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,530
<12-1,Ross>你是怎么搞的
<12-1,Ross>What the hell's the matter with you?

235
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,730
<12-1,Ross>你写信甩掉他妹妹
<12-1,Ross>How do you think Joey's gonna react

236
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,480
<12-1,Ross>乔伊会对你怎么样
<12-1,Ross>when he finds out you blow off his sister with a letter?

237
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,340
<12-2,Chandler>这时候你就告诉他  我搬到法国去了
<12-2,Chandler>Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France...

238
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,110
<12-2,Chandler>事实上  我人会在古巴
<12-2,Chandler>when actually I'll be in Cuba.

239
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,900
<12-3,Ross>听我说  你得亲自去做这件事
<12-3,Ross>Look, you've got to do this yourself okay? In person.

240
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,990
<12-3,Ross>至少你知道她叫什么名字
<12-3,Ross>At least, you know her name.

241
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,910
<12-3,Ross>你只要到他家去找玛丽·安琪拉
<12-3,Ross>You just go to the house and ask for Mary Angela. Okay?

242
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,320
<12-4,Chandler>不管她是哪一个  她到门口来的时候
<12-4,Chandler>When whichever one she is comes to the door...

243
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,940
<12-3,Ross>请她去散个步  给她留点面子
<12-3,Ross>you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.

244
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,260
<12-4,Chandler>万一是玛丽·安琪拉来开门
<12-4,Chandler>Okay. What if Mary Angela comes to the door

245
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,020
<12-4,Chandler>而我又开口找她呢
<12-4,Chandler>and I ask for Mary Angela?

246
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,100
<12-5,Ross>你要去古巴哪里
<12-5,Ross>Where in Cuba?

247
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,330
<13-1,Chandler>乔伊  你在这里干嘛
<13-1,Chandler>Joey, What are you doing here?

248
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,500
<13-2,Joey>等我奶奶帮我洗衣服

253
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,390
<13-4,Joey>别乱讲话  因为奶奶还不知道你们的事
<13-4,Joey>You got be cool, because my grandma doesn't know about you two yet.

254
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,970
<13-4,Joey>最好不要惹她生气
<13-4,Joey>And you don't want to tick her off.

255
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,520
<13-4,Joey>她是第六个在墨索里尼的尸体上吐痰的人
<13-4,Joey>She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

256
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,580

<14-5,Monica>谁规定你得在这里痴痴地等
<14-5,Monica>I mean who says you have to sit here and wait for him?

267
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,140
<14-5,Monica>你得主动出击
<14-5,Monica>You've got to make stuff happen!

<16-3,Chandler>You're not Mary Angela?

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,320
<16-4,Chandler>这真是太糟糕了
<16-4,Chandler>This is so bad.

342
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,500

<16-8,Chandler>You're it! Now run and hide!

349
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,120
<16-8,Chandler>没什么大不了的  钱德勒刚才亲我
<16-8,Chandler>It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissing me...

350
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,100
<16-9,Joey>因为他以为我是玛丽·安琪拉
<16-9,Joey>because he thought I was Mary Angela.

351
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,890
<16-9,Joey>什么  你怎么会把她当成玛丽·安琪拉
<16-9,Joey>What? How could you do that? How could you think she was Mary Angela?

352
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,880
<16-10,Chandler>我不确定哪一个是玛丽·安琪拉
<16-10,Chandler>I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was.

353
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,230
<16-10,Chandler>对不起  我喝得醉醺醺
<16-10,Chandler>Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I was really drunk...

357
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,200
<16-12,Chandler>因为你们的兄弟是不会揍我的
<16-12,Chandler>because, you know, your brother's not gonna punch me.

358
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,300

00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,900
<16-13,Joey>但我万万没想到有一天会揍你
<16-13,Joey>But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it.

361
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,160
<16-13,Joey>你怎么能做这种事
<16-13,Joey>How could you do this?

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,100
<16-14,Chandler>乔伊  如果你想揍我就动手吧  我罪有应得
<16-14,Chandler>Joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead. I deserve it.
