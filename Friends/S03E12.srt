<1-25,Phoebe>Why don't you guys get a magician?

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,760
<1-26,Chandler>如果魔术师可以用臀部给我开啤酒就行
<1-26,Chandler>If magician can open my beer with his butt-cheeks, then all right.

52
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,180
<2-1,Ross>她要跟他吃午饭  跟他吃午饭
<2-1,Ross>She's having lunch with him? Lunch with him?

53
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,040
<2-1,Ross>你该看看她被录用时  他是怎么拥抱她的
<2-1,Ross>You should've seen the hug he gave when she got the job!

54
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,020
<2-1,Ross>而且他真是一表人才

<2-1,Ross>-我该怎么办  -什么都别做
<2-1,Ross>- What am I gonna do? - You don't do anything.

<4-17,Monica>Right here?

132
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,550
<4-18,Julio>我可以为这片嘴唇写一部史诗
<4-18,Julio>I could write an epic poem about this lip.

133
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,820
<4-19,Monica>要怎么写
<4-19,Monica>How would that go?

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,690

<5-6,Director>for the dance audition.

149
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,860
<5-7,Joey>我的经纪人说这个角色不必跳舞
<5-7,Joey>My agent said that there wasn't a dancing part.

150
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,650
<5-8,Director>乔伊  所有的角色都要跳一点舞
<5-8,Director>Joey, all the roles gotta dance a little.

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,890
<5-8,Director>相信我  以你的舞蹈背景  这是小菜一碟
<5-8,Director>But believe me, with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.

152
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,250

168
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,350
<6-11,Monica>他性感又聪明  这让他显得更性感
<6-11,Monica>He's so sexy and smart, which makes him even sexier.

169
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,380

171
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,530
<6-11,Monica>突然之间  他停下来写了首诗
<6-11,Monica>and all of a sudden he stops to write a poem.

172
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,140
<6-12,Joey>少来了  我就算被陨石打中也停不下来

176
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,830
<6-15,Monica>总之  他走的时候忘了把这首诗带走
<6-15,Monica>Anyway, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him.

177

<8-8,Rachel>他说你们男人就是这样
<8-8,Rachel>He said this is what you guys do.

230
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,610
<8-9,Ross>如果马克这么说  那马克就是白痴
<8-9,Ross>Well, if Mark said that, then Mark's an idiot.

231

<9-3,Chandler>Don't you see what's happening here?

234
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,630
<9-3,Chandler>他没有勾引她  反而做了她的知己
<9-3,Chandler>Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidante.

235
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,990
<9-3,Chandler>现在她就会跑去跟他抱怨你
<9-3,Chandler>Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to, to complain about you.

236
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,040
<9-4,Ross>我该怎么办
<9-4,Ross>What am I gonna do?

237
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,060
<9-5,Chandler>何不送她一个音乐金龟
<9-5,Chandler>Well why don't you send her a musical bug?

238
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,270
<9-5,Chandler>不  你已经送过了

<9-5,Chandler>听着  你得亲自过去
<9-5,Chandler>All right, look, you're gonna have to go there yourself now.

240
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,690
<9-5,Chandler>偶尔让她惊喜一下
<9-5,Chandler>Okay, make a few surprise visits.

242
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,100
<9-7,Chandler>很好  不要轻举妄动
<9-7,Chandler>All right, fine, don't do anything.

243
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
<9-7,Chandler>坐着跟我们聊天好了
<9-7,Chandler>Just sit here and talk to us.

244
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,790
<9-7,Chandler>这时候  她正在跟他谈你
<9-7,Chandler>Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.

245
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,030
<9-7,Chandler>他对她体贴入微
<9-7,Chandler>And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.

246
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,320
<9-7,Chandler>她开始想  "也许他就是我的伴侣
<9-7,Chandler>She's start thinking, "Maybe this's the guy for me

247
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,080
<9-7,Chandler>他这么了解我"
<9-7,Chandler>because he understands me."

248
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,110
<9-8,Joey>你还没搞清楚状况  她就跟他在一起了
<9-8,Joey>And before you know it, she's with him.

249
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,780
<9-8,Joey>你就会说"老天"
<9-8,Joey>And you'll be all, "Oh, man!"

250
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,580
<9-8,Joey>他会说"太棒了"
<9-8,Joey>And he'll be all, "Yes!"

251
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,260
<9-8,Joey>我们都会说"哥们儿"
<9-8,Joey>And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!"

252
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,540
<9-8,Joey>很快你就会说
<9-8,Joey>And pretty soon you'll be like:

253

<9-8,Joey>"嗨"
<9-8,Joey>"Hi."

280
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,430
<11-2,Joey>这表示试镜取消了吗
<11-2,Joey>So, does that mean the audition's off?

281
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,970
<11-3,Director>乔伊  既然你的经验丰富

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,050
<11-6,Joey>这么说是踏步舞步和爵士手势
<11-6,Joey>So that's, "Steppity-step and jazz hands."

292
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,410
<11-7,Director>跳得高兴点

293
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,250
<12-2,Monica>再见
<12-2,Monica>Bye.

294
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,740
<12-3,Phoebe>你在包什么
<12-3,Phoebe>What are you wrapping?

295
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,930
<12-4,Monica>看我送胡利欧什么
<12-4,Monica>Look what I got Julio.

296
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,100
<12-5,Phoebe>是个花瓶
<12-5,Phoebe>It's a vase.

297
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,480
<12-6,Monica>就像他那首诗
<12-6,Monica>Just like the one in the poem.

298
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,100
<12-7,Phoebe>不完全跟那首诗一样
<12-7,Phoebe>Not exactly like the one in the poem.

299
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,240
<12-8,Monica>此话怎讲
<12-8,Monica>What do you mean?

300
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,970
<12-9,Phoebe>记得你说过你看不懂诗吗
<12-9,Phoebe>Remember how you said that you were really dense about poetry?

301
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,880
<12-9,Phoebe>是的
<12-9,Phoebe>Yeah.

302
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,880
<13-1,Monica>这么说我只是个空洞的花瓶
<13-1,Monica>So I'm just an empty vase?

303
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,210
<13-2,Julio>什么
<13-2,Julio>What?

304
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,570
<13-3,Monica>我不像你那样常看名著
<13-3,Monica>So, I don't read as many important books as you do.

305
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,440
<13-3,Monica>我也不写表里不一的怪诗
<13-3,Monica>And I don't write trick poems

306
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,020
<13-3,Monica>看起来是一回事  其实是另一回事
<13-3,Monica>that seems about one thing, but actully about something else.

307
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,510
<13-3,Monica>愚蠢的东西令我很激动
<13-3,Monica>And you know what, I get excited about stupid stuff...

308
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,220
<13-3,Monica>比如说周六到的《人物》杂志
<13-3,Monica>like when my People magazine comes on Saturday...

309
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,770
<13-3,Monica>"应有尽有"商店新一期的购物目录
<13-3,Monica>and the new "Hold Everything" catalog.

310
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,220
<13-3,Monica>但这并不表示我是空洞的
<13-3,Monica>You know, but that doesn't mean I'm empty.

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,900
<13-3,Monica>我关心我的家人和朋友
<13-3,Monica>I care about things. I care about my friends and family.

312
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,660
<13-3,Monica>你没有权利批判我
<13-3,Monica>You have no right to make that kind of judgement!

313
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,850
<13-5,Monica>你根本不了解我
<13-5,Monica>You don't even know me!

314
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,350
<13-6,Julio>这首诗讲的不是你
<13-6,Julio>The poem is not about you.

315
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:45,790
<13-7,Monica>什么
<13-7,Monica>What?

316
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,330
<13-8,Julio>"空花瓶"讲的不是你
<13-8,Julio>"The Empty Vase" is not about you.

317
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,400
<13-8,Julio>我亲爱的美女
<13-8,Julio>My baby preciosa....

318
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,810
<13-8,Julio>你居然这么想  我好难过
<13-8,Julio>You make me so sad that you would think this.

319
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,690
<13-9,Monica>对不起  这...
<13-9,Monica>I'm sorry. It's....

320
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,160
<13-9,Monica>我朋友菲比说...
<13-9,Monica>My friend Phoebe said...

321
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,870
<13-10,Julio>这是讲所有的女人
<13-10,Julio>No. It's about all women.

322
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,820
<13-10,Julio>应该是说
<13-10,Julio>Well...

323
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,160
<13-10,Julio>全美国的女人
<13-10,Julio>all American women.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,750
<13-10,Julio>释怀了没有
<13-10,Julio>You feel better now?

325
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,500
<13-10,Julio>是啊

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,460
<14-3,Joey>他们最多只能跳到这个程度
<14-3,Joey>It's the best I could get out of them.

330
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,450

<15-11,Rachel>为什么  我们在一起快一年了
<15-11,Rachel>Why is it hard? We've been together for almost a year now.

350
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,640
<15-12,Ross>我跟卡罗尔在一起八年了

00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,920
<15-12,Ross>而我失去了她
<15-12,Ross>And I lost her.

352
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,380
<15-12,Ross>如果有这个可能  我想我爱你比爱她更深
