17
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,630
<1-15,Monica>也许老天爷知道我会碰到你
<1-15,Monica>Or maybe it just cause God knew I'd be running into you

18
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,590
<1-15,Monica>觉得这是个机会

<3-19,Phoebe>他要教我各种运动
<3-19,Phoebe>He's gonna teach me how to do all sorts of jock stuff.

<3-20,Ross>-那你要如何回报他  -我会让他达到目的
<3-20,Ross>- And what are you gonna do for him? - I'm gonna let him.

70
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,390
<3-28,Rachel>什么时候的事
<3-28,Rachel>When did this happen?

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,450
<3-29,Monica>大概八点两分
<3-29,Monica>Around 8:02.

72
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,860
<3-29,Monica>我们聊了一会儿
<3-29,Monica>We talked for a little while,

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,490
<3-29,Monica>然后一起吃了个单纯的汉堡
<3-29,Monica>and then we went out for an innocent burger.

74
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,100
<3-30,Phoebe>没有所谓"单纯的汉堡"
<3-30,Phoebe>There's no such thing as an "innocent burger."

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,860
<3-31,Ross>-你还会跟他见面吗  -明天晚上
<3-31,Ross>- Are you gonna see him again? - Tomorrow night.

76
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
<3-33,Rachel>莫妮卡  你这是在干什么
<3-33,Rachel>Monica, what are you doing?

77
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,280
<3-34,Chandler>她花了六个月才忘记他
<3-34,Chandler>She spent the last six months getting over him...

78
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,900
<3-34,Chandler>现在她庆祝的方式就是跟他约会
<3-34,Chandler>and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.

79
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,670
<3-35,Monica>这不是约会  好吗
<3-35,Monica>It's not a date, okay?

80
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,500
<3-35,Monica>我要教他做千层面
<3-35,Monica>I'm just gonna teach him how to make a lasagna

81
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,360
<3-35,Monica>他有个自带食物的聚餐
<3-35,Monica>for some potluck dinner he has.

82
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,170
<3-36,Joey>最好多做一点
<3-36,Joey>You might want to make a little extra,

83
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,380
<3-36,Joey>做爱之后会很饿的
<3-36,Joey>because you'll probably be hungry after the sex.

84
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,230
<3-37,Monica>我们不会上床的
<3-37,Monica>We're not gonna have sex.

85
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,250
<3-37,Monica>一切照旧  他还是不要孩子
<3-37,Monica>Okay? Nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children,

86
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,490
<3-37,Monica>我还是想要孩子
<3-37,Monica>and I still do.

87
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,430
<3-37,Monica>所以我们只能当朋友
<3-37,Monica>So that's why we're gonna just be friends.

88
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,230
<3-38,Ross>炮友
<3-38,Ross>Naked friends.

89
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,190
<4-3,Rachel>-你有冰吗  -打开冰箱自己看
<4-3,Rachel>- Do you have any ice? - Check the freezer.

90
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,810
<4-4,Joey>如果没有  那大概就是用完了
<4-4,Joey>If there's none in there, we're probably out.

91
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,800
<4-4,Joey>你刚下班吗  很晚了
<4-4,Joey>Are you just getting home from work? It's late.

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,060
<4-5,Rachel>我知道  不过今天实在太棒了
<4-5,Rachel>Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day, though.

93
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
<4-5,Rachel>我有幸与卡文·克莱的销售代表开会
<4-5,Rachel>I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klein.

94
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,890
<4-5,Rachel>我告诉上司  我看中一款性感内衣
<4-5,Rachel>I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie.

95
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,040
<4-5,Rachel>她就订了很多  你呢
<4-5,Rachel>She ordered a ton of it. How was your day?

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,270
<4-6,Joey>我发现我可以光用舌头就数完所有牙齿
<4-6,Joey>I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.

97
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,040
<4-7,Rachel>你把一本《闪灵》放在冰箱里干嘛
<4-7,Rachel>Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?

98
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,270
<4-8,Joey>我昨晚越看越害怕  就...
<4-8,Joey>I was reading it last night and I got scared, so....

99
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,310
<4-9,Rachel>把书放进冰箱你就安全了吗
<4-9,Rachel>But you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?

100
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,210
<4-10,Joey>至少安全一点
<4-10,Joey>Well, safer.

101
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,420
<4-10,Joey>我每次看《闪灵》
<4-10,Joey>I mean I never start reading The Shining...

102
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,540
<4-10,Joey>都要先确定冰箱里有地方放
<4-10,Joey>without making sure we got plenty room in the freezer.

103
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,430
<4-11,Rachel>你常看这本书吗
<4-11,Rachel>How often do you read it?

104
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,410
<4-12,Joey>你从不把一本书一看再看吗
<4-12,Joey>Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?

105
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,980
<4-13,Rachel>《小妇人》我看了好几次
<4-13,Rachel>I guess I've read Little Women more than once.

106
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,330
<4-13,Rachel>那可是名著  《闪灵》哪里好看
<4-13,Rachel>But I mean that's a classic. What's so great about The Shining?

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,100
<4-14,Joey>瑞秋  你应该问《闪灵》有哪里不好看
<4-14,Joey>The question should be, Rach, what is not so great about The Shining?

108
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,840
<4-14,Joey>答案是"没有"  知道吗
<4-14,Joey>Okay? And the answer would be, "nothing." All right?

109
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,470
<4-14,Joey>这是有史以来最恐怖的书
<4-14,Joey>This is like the scariest book ever.

110
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,130
<4-14,Joey>一定比你的经典作品好看多了
<4-14,Joey>I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.

111
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,680
<4-14,Joey>好吧
<4-14,Joey>Okay.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,980
<4-15,Rachel>我们走着瞧  好吗
<4-15,Rachel>We'll just see about that, okay?

113
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,070
<4-15,Rachel>我看《闪灵》
<4-15,Rachel>I will read The Shining,

114
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,040
<4-15,Rachel>你看《小妇人》
<4-15,Rachel>and you will read Little Women.

115
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,060
<4-16,Joey>好  没问题
<4-16,Joey>All right, you got it.

116
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,110
<4-19,Rachel>-好  -好的

<4-20,Joey>- Okay. - Now, Rach, these little women....

118
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,130
<4-22,Joey>到底有多小
<4-22,Joey>How little are they?

119
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,190
<4-22,Joey>会不会小得很恐怖
<4-22,Joey>I mean, are they, like, scary little?

120
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,680
<5-1,Phoebe>钱德勒  罗斯  这是罗伯特

<5-5,Phoebe>没关系  那是我的口红  我们刚才接吻了
<5-5,Phoebe>That's okay, it's mine. We just kissed.

123
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,000
<5-7,Chandler>穿短裤在外面走有点冷吧
<5-7,Chandler>So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

124
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,630
<5-8,Robert>我是加州人
<5-8,Robert>Well, I'm from California.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,090
<5-29,Ross>我想只能尽量不要用正眼看
<5-29,Ross>Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.

144
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,670
<5-30,Chandler>就像日蚀一样
<5-30,Chandler>Like an eclipse.

145
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,300
<6-1,Richard>如果今晚有人称赞我的手艺  我该怎么说
<6-1,Richard>When people compliment me on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

146
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:10,260
<6-2,Monica>你说"多谢夸奖"  然后买礼物酬谢我
<6-2,Monica>You say, "Thank you very much." Then you buy me something pretty.

147
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,000
<6-2,Monica>来  我们把手放进这个碗里
<6-2,Monica>Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl...

148
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,950
<6-2,Monica>然后开始把番茄压碎
<6-2,Monica>and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.

149
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,960
<6-3,Richard>感觉怪怪的
<6-3,Richard>This feels very weird.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,020
<6-4,Monica>你整天摸人家的眼球  还说这感觉怪
<6-4,Monica>You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird?

151
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,260
<6-5,Richard>我当然要摸人家的眼球
<6-5,Richard>Sure, I touch them.

152
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,780
<6-5,Richard>但我好不容易才学会了不捏碎它们
<6-5,Richard>But I spent years learning not to squish them.

153
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,970
<6-5,Richard>那是我的手
<6-5,Richard>That's my hand.

154
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,550
<6-8,Monica>好了
<6-8,Monica>Okay.

155
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,000
<6-9,Richard>-继续压  -番茄吱吱响
<6-9,Richard>- Keep squishing. - The tomatoes are squishing.

156
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,370
<6-12,Monica>老天  你的衬衫沾到了
<6-12,Monica>Gosh, you got some on your shirt.

157
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,520
<6-14,Monica>等一下
<6-14,Monica>Hold on a second.

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,870
<6-14,Monica>马上抹点苏打水上去
<6-14,Monica>Just put a little club soda on it. Get to it right away.

159
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,730
<6-14,Monica>应该
<6-14,Monica>It should do...

160
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,580
<6-15,Richard>就可以了
<6-15,Richard>the trick.

161
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,170
<6-15,Richard>怎么了
<6-15,Richard>What?

162
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
<6-16,Monica>你裤子上也沾到了
<6-16,Monica>You've got some on your pants.

163
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,490
<6-17,Richard>干脆丢掉算了
<6-17,Richard>I'll just throw them out.

164
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,060
<7-1,Joey>这些小妇人
<7-1,Joey>These little women!

165
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,060
<7-2,Chandler>你喜欢吗
<7-2,Chandler>You're liking it?

166
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,640
<7-3,Joey>喜欢  艾美刚烧了乔的稿子
<7-3,Joey>Oh, yeah. Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

167
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
<7-3,Joey>我看他永远不会原谅她
<7-3,Joey>I don't see how he could ever forgive her.

168
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,740
<7-4,Ross>乔是女的  是乔瑟芬的简称
<7-4,Ross>Jo's a girl. It's short for Josephine.

169
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,040
<7-5,Joey>但乔喜欢劳瑞
<7-5,Joey>But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,860
<7-5,Joey>你是说这是女同性恋
<7-5,Joey>You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

171
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,320
<7-5,Joey>《闪灵》里就差这样了
<7-5,Joey>That is the one thing missing from The Shining.

172
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,040
<7-6,Chandler>不  其实劳瑞是男的
<7-6,Chandler>No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

173
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,860
<7-7,Joey>难怪瑞秋要看这么多遍
<7-7,Joey>No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.

174
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,570
<7-10,Ross>篮球好玩吗
<7-10,Ross>How'd the basketball go?

<7-11,Phoebe>Okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

176
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
<7-12,Chandler>你是说三分球吧
<7-12,Chandler>You mean a 3-pointer?

177
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,470
<7-13,Phoebe>我姿势优美  可以多几分
<7-13,Phoebe>I get more because I'm dainty.

<7-22,Chandler>It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area...

193
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,170
<7-22,Chandler>有点走光
<7-22,Chandler>as one may have hoped.

194
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,420
<7-23,Phoebe>什么意思

<8-1,Monica>真的  很好  现在你欠我三件礼物了
<8-1,Monica>Really? Good. So you owe me three pretty things.

199
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,490
<8-1,Monica>我一直在想着你的事
<8-1,Monica>I've been thinking a lot about you too.

200
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,940
<8-1,Monica>不  这种"破拉图"交往很不容易
<8-1,Monica>Well, no. It's hard, this "platonomy" thing.

201
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,710
<8-1,Monica>这是一个词
<8-1,Monica>It's a word.

202
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,790
<8-2,Monica>我觉得这样比较好  这样才是明智之举
<8-2,Monica>I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart.

203
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,850
<8-2,Monica>对  我肯定
<8-2,Monica>Yes, I'm sure.

<8-3,Richard>你真的肯定
<8-3,Richard>You really sure?

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,970
<8-4,Monica>我再回你电话
<8-4,Monica>I'll call you back.

206
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,970
<8-4,Monica>我们可以当炮友的
<8-4,Monica>So we can be friends who sleep together.

207
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,370
<9-1,Monica>没错  这不代表什么
<9-1,Monica>Absolutely. This'll just be something we do.

208
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,140
<9-2,Richard>就像打壁球一样
<9-2,Richard>Like racquetball.

209
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,320
<9-3,Monica>我觉得聪明又健康
<9-3,Monica>Sounds smart and healthy to me.

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,500
<9-3,Monica>不过出于好奇心
<9-3,Monica>So just out of curiosity...

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,150
<9-3,Monica>你现在还有其他打壁球的伙伴吗
<9-3,Monica>do you currently have any other "racquetball" buddies?

212
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,130
<9-4,Richard>只有你爸爸一个
<9-4,Richard>Just your dad.

213
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,240
<9-4,Richard>那是指真的壁球
<9-4,Richard>Although that's actually racquetball.

214
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,160
<9-4,Richard>我下周二
<9-4,Richard>You know, I do have a blind date...

215
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,380
<9-4,Richard>要和我妹妹的邻居约会
<9-4,Richard>with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday.

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,810
<9-6,Richard>你希望我取消吗
<9-6,Richard>Do you want me to cancel it?

217

<9-7,Monica>不要
<9-7,Monica>No!

218
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,150
<9-7,Monica>不要
<9-7,Monica>No!

219
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,410
<9-9,Monica>如果你取消  那就是为我取消的
<9-9,Monica>Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.

220
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,840
<10-1,Robert>-而我们只是朋友  -没错
<10-1,Robert>- And we're just friends. - Exactly.

221
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,310
<10-2,Phoebe>不要坐
<10-2,Phoebe>Oh, don't sit down.

222
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,560
<10-3,Robert>-准备好做击球练习了吗  -那是当然
<10-3,Robert>- You ready to go to the batting cage? - Yeah, You bet.

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,850
<10-4,Phoebe>不过先送你一个礼物
<10-4,Phoebe>And first, here's a gift.

224
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,240
<10-6,Chandler>紧身运动裤

<10-6,Chandler>Those are the greatest things in the world!

226
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,100
<10-6,Chandler>如果我是你  我会天天穿  天天穿
<10-6,Chandler>If I were you, I'd wear them everyday every day.

227
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,940
<10-7,Robert>谢谢  真的  你太体贴了
<10-7,Robert>Gee, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

228
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,500
<10-7,Robert>不过老实说  我觉得我穿不了
<10-7,Robert>But, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.

229
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,870
<10-7,Robert>太紧了  我会觉得轮廓会被别人看到
<10-7,Robert>They're so tight. I'd feel like I'm on display.

230
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,990
<11-2,Rachel>对不起
<11-2,Rachel>I'm sorry.

<10-13,Rachel>Danny just went into Room 217.

236
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,730
<10-14,Joey>下面是最精彩的  浴缸里的死女人...
<10-14,Joey>The next part's the best! That dead lady in the bathtub...

237
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,940
<10-15,Rachel>别说  拜托  这样就不好看了
<10-15,Rachel>No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!

238
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,000
<10-16,Joey>好吧  我用暗号说
<10-16,Joey>All right, I'll talk in code.

239
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,660
<10-16,Joey>记得小孩在走廊看到那两个空白吗
<10-16,Joey>Remember when the kid sees those two "blanks" in the hallway?

240
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,050
<10-17,Chandler>对  那里很好看
<10-17,Chandler>Yeah, that's very cool.

241
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,650
<10-18,Joey>所有的空白把空白弄成了空白空白
<10-18,Joey>All "blank" and no "blank" makes "blank" a "blank-blank."

242
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,640
<10-18,Joey>不  讲结局
<10-18,Joey>No, the end!

243
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,110
<10-18,Joey>杰克差点用空白杀了他们
<10-18,Joey>When Jack almost kills them all with the "blank"...

244
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
<10-18,Joey>不过到最后关头他们还是跑了
<10-18,Joey>but in the last second, they get away.

245
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,260
<10-19,Rachel>乔伊  你居然做这种事
<10-19,Rachel>Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

246
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,020
<10-20,Chandler>她居然破解了你的暗号
<10-20,Chandler>I can't believe she cracked your code.

247
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,800
<10-21,Rachel>好吧  劳瑞跟乔求婚  她拒绝了
<10-21,Rachel>All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no...

248
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,590
<10-21,Rachel>即使她深爱着他
<10-21,Rachel>even though she's still in love with him.

249
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,040
<10-21,Rachel>他后来娶了艾美
<10-21,Rachel>Then he ends up marrying Amy.

250
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,260
<10-22,Joey>喂  我不是存心要讲的
<10-22,Joey>Hey, mine was by accident!

251
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,160
<10-22,Joey>好吧  锅炉爆炸  烧毁旅馆
<10-22,Joey>All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel

252
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,800
<10-22,Joey>那个爸爸也被烧死了
<10-22,Joey>and kills the dad.

253
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,140
<10-24,Joey>贝丝死了
<10-24,Joey>Beth dies.

254
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,220
<10-24,Joey>贝丝死了
<10-24,Joey>Beth dies?

255
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,270
<10-26,Joey>真的吗  如果继续看下去贝丝就会死
<10-26,Joey>Is that true? If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

256
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,320
<10-27,Chandler>不  贝丝不会死
<10-27,Chandler>No, Beth doesn't die.

257
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,370
<10-27,Chandler>她不会死  对不对瑞秋
<10-27,Chandler>She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

258
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,000
<10-29,Ross>-什么  -乔伊问的是  你是不是毁了
<10-29,Ross>- What? - Joey's asking if you just have ruined...

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,090
<10-29,Ross>他喜欢的第一本
<10-29,Ross>the first book he's ever loved

260
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,440
<10-29,Ross>不是由杰克·尼克逊当主角的小说
<10-29,Ross>that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

261
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,820
<10-30,Rachel>不  她不会死
<10-30,Rachel>No. She doesn't die.

262
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,760
<10-31,Joey>那你干嘛这么说
<10-31,Joey>Then why would you say that?

263
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,180
<10-32,Rachel>因为我故意要伤害你
<10-32,Rachel>Because I wanted to hurt you.

264
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,740
<10-33,Robert>在这里  我的钥匙掉了
<10-33,Robert>Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

265
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,970
<11-1,Monica>找到了
<11-1,Monica>Got them.

266
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,850
<11-2,Rachel>对不起  对不起
<11-2,Rachel>Sorry. I'm sorry.

267
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,080
<11-3,Monica>你一定不敢相信我今天有多惨
<11-3,Monica>You would not believe my day.

268
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,940
<11-3,Monica>我上了两个班  雪上加霜的是
<11-3,Monica>I had to work two shifts. And then to top it off...

269
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,220
<11-3,Monica>我的一边假胸又被烤炉的火烧了
<11-3,Monica>I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.

270
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,700
<11-4,Monica>你在笑什么
<11-4,Monica>What are you smiling at?

271
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,130
<11-5,Rachel>我在想可能会柳暗花明又一村
<11-5,Rachel>I was thinking your day could still pick up.

272
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,420
<11-7,Richard>你好
<11-7,Richard>Hello.

273
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,680
<11-8,Monica>我喜欢这种朋友关系
<11-8,Monica>I love this "friend" thing!

274
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,710
<12-1,Phoebe>罗伯特马上就要来了
<12-1,Phoebe>Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second,

275
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,290
<12-1,Phoebe>你们谁跟他说一声好吗
<12-1,Phoebe>so could one of you just tell him?

276
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,500
<12-3,Phoebe>拜托  马上说
<12-3,Phoebe>Please, right now.

277
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,720
<12-3,Phoebe>我一见他就想  那玩意儿是不是晃来晃去
<12-3,Phoebe>Every time I see him, it's like, "is it on the loose?

278
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,120
<12-3,Phoebe>是不是在看着我
<12-3,Phoebe>Is it watching me?"

279
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,270
<12-4,Chandler>我们不能跟他说
<12-4,Chandler>We can't tell him.

280
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,900
<12-4,Chandler>你不能跟完全不熟悉的男人
<12-4,Chandler>You can't go up to a guy you barely know

281
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,360
<12-4,Chandler>谈论他的"那个"
<12-4,Chandler>and talk about his "stuff."

282
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,530
<12-5,Ross>他说得对  就算是赞美也不行
<12-5,Ross>He's right. Even if it's to say something complimentary.

283
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,250
<12-7,Phoebe>可以去健身房了吗
<12-7,Phoebe>So you ready for the gym?

284
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,390
<12-8,Robert>有一面新的攀岩墙  我们可以互相照看
<12-8,Robert>They got this new rock-climbing wall. We can spot each other.

285
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,590
<12-9,Phoebe>我从这里就可以看到你
<12-9,Phoebe>Yeah, I can spot you from here.

286
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,830
<12-10,Robert>什么

<12-14,Phoebe>我觉得你这个人真的很棒
<12-14,Phoebe>I think you're really, really great.

291
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,780
<12-15,Robert>老天  又来了
<12-15,Robert>Oh, God. Here we go again.

292
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,200
<12-15,Robert>为什么我老是发生这种事
<12-15,Robert>Why does this keep happening to me?

293
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,320
<12-15,Robert>我什么东西让你不高兴吗
<12-15,Robert>Is it something I'm putting out there?

294
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,950
<12-15,Robert>这是我的错吗  我很蠢吗(也指睾丸)
<12-15,Robert>Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

295
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,090
<12-16,Phoebe>我不知道该怎么说
<12-16,Phoebe>I don't know what to say.

296
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,620
<12-17,Gunther>老弟  这地方老少皆宜
<12-17,Gunther>Hey, buddy? This is a family place.

297
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,700
<12-17,Gunther>把鸡鸡放回屋里去
<12-17,Gunther>Put the mouse back in the house.

298
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,950
<13-2,Richard>真的  这间公寓很普通啊
<13-2,Richard>Really? It's just like everyone else's apartment.

299
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,210
<13-2,Richard>一样有房间  墙壁和天花板
<13-2,Richard>It's got rooms and walls and ceilings.

300
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,130
<13-2,Richard>我只是想看看你住的地方  带我参观下
<13-2,Richard>I just wanted to see where you live. Now give me the tour.

301
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,330
<13-3,Monica>我的天
<13-3,Monica>Oh, my God!

302
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,960
<13-4,Richard>-这里是客厅  -真舒适
<13-4,Richard>- This is the living room. - That's nice.

303
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,530
<13-5,Richard>-这里是厨房  -真漂亮
<13-5,Richard>- And this is the kitchen. - That's real pretty.

304
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,470
<13-6,Richard>等一下  我能参观卧室吗
<13-6,Richard>Wait a minute. Don't I get to see the bedroom?

305
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,280
<13-6,Richard>这是很普通的
<13-6,Richard>Well, it's pretty much your typical...

306
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,840
<13-6,Richard>卧室
<13-6,Richard>bedroom.

307
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,290
<13-7,Richard>我们还在门的这一边  我还没看到
<13-7,Richard>We're still on this side of the door. I didn't get to see it.

308
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,950
<13-8,Richard>要命  下次吧  今晚非常愉快
<13-8,Richard>Oh, shoot. Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.

309
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,730
<14-1,Monica>她是谁
<14-1,Monica>So who is she?

310
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,080
<14-2,Richard>就是我跟你说过的约会对象
<14-2,Richard>That was the blind date that I told you about.

311
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,370
<14-2,Richard>她打电话来改期到今天
<14-2,Richard>She called and switched it from Tuesday.

312
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,970
<14-3,Monica>你喜欢她吗
<14-3,Monica>Did you like her?

313
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,880
<14-3,Monica>我是以朋友的身份问的  因为我不会不高兴
<14-3,Monica>I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.

314
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,880
<14-4,Richard>你看起来是挺高兴的
<14-4,Richard>Well, you seem fine.

315
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,600
<14-5,Monica>好吧  我不高兴  我很不高兴
<14-5,Monica>Okay, you know what? I'm not fine. I'm not.

316
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,430
<14-5,Monica>我怎么高兴得起来  听到你跟她进来
<14-5,Monica>I mean, how could I be fine? Hearing you come in with her.

317
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,970
<14-5,Monica>她还想参观你的卧室
<14-5,Monica>She wants to see your bedroom.

318
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,550
<14-5,Monica>你知道吗
<14-5,Monica>You know what?

319
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,860
<14-5,Monica>我们或许可以做朋友
<14-5,Monica>What if we're friends...

320
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,510
<14-5,Monica>但不跟其他人交往
<14-5,Monica>who don't see other people?

321
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,090
<14-6,Richard>你是说"专属的"朋友
<14-6,Richard>You mean like "exclusive" friends?

322
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,730
<14-6,Richard>有何不可
<14-6,Richard>Why not?

323
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,610
<14-7,Monica>我是说  这周过的棒极了
<14-7,Monica>I mean, this has been the most amazing week.

324
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,620
<14-7,Monica>这也没什么不好吧
<14-7,Monica>Would it be so terrible?

325
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,470
<14-7,Monica>我们还可以一边做朋友  一边同居
<14-7,Monica>Even if we were friends who lived together?

326
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,880
<14-7,Monica>或许有一天
<14-7,Monica>Or maybe someday,

327
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,760
<14-7,Monica>可以站在其他朋友面前
<14-7,Monica>friends who stood up in front of their other friends...

328
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,740
<14-7,Monica>发誓当一辈子的朋友
<14-7,Monica>and vowed to be friends forever.

329
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,480
<14-8,Richard>我们又回到原点了
<14-8,Richard>You know, we're back where we were.

330
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,830
<14-8,Richard>亲爱的  我求之不得
<14-8,Richard>Honey, I would love to do all that,

331
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,180
<14-8,Richard>但一切都没有改变
<14-8,Richard>but nothing's changed.

332
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,890
<14-9,Monica>不是这样的  你把胡子刮掉了
<14-9,Monica>That's not true. You don't have a moustache.

333
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,380
<14-10,Richard>好吧  有一件事改变了
<14-10,Richard>Okay, one thing's changed.

334
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,020
<14-10,Richard>但我们的生活目标不同
<14-10,Richard>But we still want different things,

335
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,170
<14-10,Richard>我们都知道结局是什么
<14-10,Richard>and we know how this is gonna end.

336
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,110
<14-10,Richard>你知道吗
<14-10,Richard>You know what?

337
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,290
<14-11,Monica>我得马上离开这个房间
<14-11,Monica>I gotta walk out of here right now.

338
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,520
<14-11,Monica>因为忘记你是我一生中最困难的事
<14-11,Monica>Because getting over you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.

339
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,180
<14-11,Monica>我想我再也做不到了
<14-11,Monica>I don't think I could do it again.

340
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
<14-12,Richard>我知道我做不到
<14-12,Richard>I know I couldn't.

341
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,710
<14-12,Richard>那么
