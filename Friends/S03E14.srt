<1-12,Phoebe>不是吧  唱这种别有深意的歌
<1-12,Phoebe>No. One of those "look for the hidden meaning" songs.

34

<2-1,Singer>嘿  菲比

<2-3,Leslie>我在卖大鱼的地方碰到弗拉德
<2-3,Leslie>I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish.

38

<2-3,Leslie>他说你常在这里表演  所以...

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,470
<2-4,Chandler>如果她们又谈到"大鱼"
<2-4,Chandler>But the place with "big-fish" comes up again...

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,940
<2-4,Chandler>我想知道是好几条大鱼
<2-4,Chandler>I'd like to know whether that's several big fish

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,650
<2-4,Chandler>还是只有一条大鱼
<2-4,Chandler>or just one big fish.

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,340
<2-5,Joey>菲比说你写广告歌
<2-5,Joey>So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.

44

<2-6,Phoebe>我是说她抛弃我去写广告歌
<2-6,Phoebe>Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.

<2-9,Leslie>但我已经不写了  我有点厌倦了
<2-9,Leslie>But I don't do that anymore. I got kind of sick of it.

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,810
<2-9,Leslie>我也写不出好东西了  所以被炒鱿鱼了
<2-9,Leslie>And then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.

50
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,950
<2-10,Phoebe>太可惜了

<2-11,Leslie>maybe you'd want to get back together?

<6-16,Joey>That's the girl I was hiding from.

131
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,180
<6-16,Joey>要是知道他是我室友
<6-16,Joey>When she finds out he's my roommate,

132
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,700
<6-16,Joey>她一定会把我的丑事抖出来
<6-16,Joey>she's gonna tell him what I did.

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,850
<6-17,Monica>你做了什么
<6-17,Monica>What did you do?

137
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,510
<6-18,Joey>做过那么过分的事
<6-18,Joey>I've ever done in my whole life.

138
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,050
<6-19,Monica>别告诉我们

140
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,840
<6-19,Monica>那样更好玩
<6-19,Monica>Because it'll be more fun that way.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,920
<6-19,Monica>好吧
<6-19,Monica>All right.

<6-20,Joey>金吉儿和我约会了几次  有一个周末
<6-20,Joey>Ginger and I gone out a few times. Then this one weekend...

144
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,880
<6-20,Joey>我们去了她爸爸的度假木屋
<6-20,Joey>we went up to her Dad's cabin...

<6-20,Joey>her annoying little dog, Pepper.

147
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,870
<6-20,Joey>那天晚上我做了一顿浪漫的烛光晚餐
<6-20,Joey>Well, that night I cooked this really romantic dinner...

150
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,260
<6-22,Joey>晚饭后  我们两个和椒椒在炉火前睡着了
<6-22,Joey>After dinner, me, her and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,800

<6-22,Joey>I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the fire was dying out...

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,400
<6-22,Joey>就拿起一条木柴丢进去
<6-22,Joey>so I picked up a log and threw it on.

153
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,440
<6-22,Joey>至少我以为那是条木柴
<6-22,Joey>Or at least what I thought was a log.

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,120
<6-23,Phoebe>我的天  你把椒椒丢进火里了

<14-15,Joey>她觉得这件事好笑吗
<14-15,Joey>by any chance, did she find that funny?

283
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,190
<15-4,Rachel>听皮兹坦教授说
<15-4,Rachel>listening to Professor "Pitstains" say:

284
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,450

<15-4,Rachel>记得亿万年前死掉的东西吗
<15-4,Rachel>Remember that thing that's been died for a gazillion years ago?

286
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,780
<15-4,Rachel>我们过去不知道它有这块小骨头
<15-4,Rachel>Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!"

287
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,880
<15-5,Ross>首先  他是皮坦教授
<15-5,Ross>First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

288
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,820
<15-5,Ross>其次  那块小骨头证明了
<15-5,Ross>And second of all, that little bone proved that...

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,250
<15-7,Ross>不知道会有多少人去看
<15-7,Ross>I wonder how many people would go see a movie

295
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,610
<15-7,Ross>叫做《侏罗纪风衣》的电影

298
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,930
<15-10,Rachel>如果我的工作这么差劲
<15-10,Rachel>You know. If what I do is so lame...

299
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,560
<15-10,Rachel>那你今天早上为什么要坚持陪我去
<15-10,Rachel>then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?

300
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,530
<15-10,Rachel>这样我就不会跟马克去吗
<15-10,Rachel>Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?

301
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,400
<15-10,Rachel>不
<15-10,Rachel>No.

302
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,890
<15-11,Ross>我想跟你在一起
<15-11,Ross>I wanted to be with you.

303
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,710
<15-11,Ross>我不知道  我最近觉得
<15-11,Ross>I don't know, I feel like lately...

304
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,820
<15-11,Ross>你离我越来越远
<15-11,Ross>feel like you're slipping away from me...

305
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,400
<15-11,Ross>你有了新工作  认识了新朋友
<15-11,Ross>you know, with this new job and all these new people.

306
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,260
<15-11,Ross>你的人生多姿多彩
<15-11,Ross>And you've got this whole other life going on.

307
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,310
<15-11,Ross>我知道这很傻
<15-11,Ross>I know it's dumb...

308
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,550
<15-12,Rachel>但我痛恨不能参与你的生活
<15-12,Rachel>but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.

309
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,000
<15-12,Rachel>这并不傻
<15-12,Rachel>It's not dumb.

310
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,640
<15-12,Rachel>但也许你不参与也不要紧
<15-12,Rachel>But maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.

311
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,980
<15-12,Rachel>你懂我的意思吗
<15-12,Rachel>You know what I mean?

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,530
<15-12,Rachel>我是说
<15-12,Rachel>I mean, it's like...

313
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,880
<15-12,Rachel>我不希望你参与我在这方面的生活
<15-12,Rachel>I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.

314
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,180
<15-13,Ross>这样就清楚一点了
<15-13,Ross>That's a little clearer.

315
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,930
<15-14,Rachel>亲爱的  这并不表示我不爱你
<15-14,Rachel>Honey, see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you...

316
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,060
<15-14,Rachel>因为我是爱你的  我非常爱你
<15-14,Rachel>because I do. I love you, I love you so much.

317
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,530
<15-14,Rachel>但是这是我的工作  你明白吗
<15-14,Rachel>But my work It's for me, you know?

318
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,150
<15-14,Rachel>我独立自主  努力投入
<15-14,Rachel>I'm out there on my own, and I'm doing it.

319
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,450
<15-14,Rachel>这很可怕
<15-14,Rachel>And it's scary,

320
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,380
<15-14,Rachel>但我很喜欢  因为这是属于我的
<15-14,Rachel>but I love it because it's mine.

321
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,370
<15-14,Rachel>这样可以吗
<15-14,Rachel>But I mean, is that okay?

322
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,400
<15-14,Rachel>当然
<15-14,Rachel>Sure.

<16-1,Ginger>You're thinking about my leg, aren't you.

324
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,970
<16-2,Chandler>不  其实我已经忘了  那是怎么回事
<16-2,Chandler>No, actually, I forgot. What's the deal with that again?

325
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,930
<16-3,Ginger>如果你介意也不要紧
<16-3,Ginger>It's okay if it bothers you.

326
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,800
<16-3,Ginger>我只需要知道你介意到什么程度
<16-3,Ginger>I mean the only thing I need to know it's how much it bothers you...

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,140
<16-3,Ginger>因为我不喜欢浪费时间
<16-3,Ginger>because I don't like wasting my time.

328
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,250
<16-3,Ginger>我在浪费时间吗
<16-3,Ginger>Am I wasting my time?

330
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,980
<16-5,Ginger>这也没什么  只要习惯就好了
<16-5,Ginger>It's just like anything else. You just have to get used to it.

331
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,990
<16-6,Ginger>那是什么
<16-6,Ginger>What's that?

<16-11,Chandler>怎么了
