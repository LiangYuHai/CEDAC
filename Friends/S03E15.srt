00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,350
<6-9,Chandler>我想也是
<6-9,Chandler>Yeah, I think so.

128
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,740
<6-10,Joey>老天  如果今晚出现这种场面那就太诡异了
<6-10,Joey>God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight.

129
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,400
<6-11,Chandler>对  我是说...
<6-11,Chandler>Yeah, I mean...

130
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,000
<6-11,Chandler>我们该怎么办
<6-11,Chandler>what would we do?

131
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,210
<6-12,Joey>兄弟  我可不知道
<6-12,Joey>Dude, I don't know.

132
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,300
<6-13,Chandler>她是开玩笑的
<6-13,Chandler>She was kidding.

133
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,820
<6-13,Chandler>她是...
<6-13,Chandler>She was....

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,110
<6-15,Chandler>我们应该订下基本规则  以防万一
<6-15,Chandler>You know, just in case, maybe we should come up with set ground rules.

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,670
<6-16,Joey>对  那当然
<6-16,Joey>Yeah. For sure.

136
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,980
<6-16,Joey>最重要的原则就是  "绝对不要张开眼睛"
<6-16,Joey>Okay. Probably want the first one to be, "Never open your eyes."

137
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,700
<6-16,Joey>你可不想在做什么的时候
<6-16,Joey>Because you don't want to be doing something...

138
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,590
<6-16,Joey>抬头一看  对不对
<6-16,Joey>and then look up, right?

139
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,000
<6-16,Joey>看到你不想看的东西
<6-16,Joey>And see something that you don't want to be seeing.

140
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,730
<6-17,Chandler>说得好  不错
<6-17,Chandler>Good call. Nice.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,750
<6-17,Chandler>等等  等等
<6-17,Chandler>Hold it! Hold it!

142
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,780
<6-17,Chandler>万一我的眼睛闭上  然后
<6-17,Chandler>What if my eyes are closed, and...

143
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:10,870
<6-17,Chandler>我的手在那里...
<6-17,Chandler>and my hand is out there....

144
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,710
<6-18,Joey>好吧  眼睛不能闭着
<6-18,Joey>Okay, eyes open at all times!

145
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,630
<6-18,Joey>我们怎么决定
<6-18,Joey>How do we decide where we...

146
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,660
<6-18,Joey>哪个人
<6-18,Joey>you know, each would...

147
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,940
<6-18,Joey>要在
<6-18,Joey>you know...

148
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,400
<6-19,Chandler>哪里
<6-19,Chandler>be?

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,850
<6-19,Chandler>对  我们可以丢硬币决定
<6-19,Chandler>Right. Well, you know, we could flip for it.

150
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,980
<6-20,Joey>我想也是  不过头尾分别代表什么
<6-20,Joey>I guess. But like, what's heads and what's tails?

151
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,520
<6-21,Chandler>如果你连这个都不知道
<6-21,Chandler>If you don't know that,

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,660
<6-21,Chandler>我也不想跟你一起上了
<6-21,Chandler>then I don't want to do this with you.

153
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,960
<7-1,Rachel>不  订单就在我面前
<7-1,Rachel>No, no. I am looking at a purchase order right here...

154
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,490
<7-1,Rachel>上面说我们订的是里维拉比基尼
<7-1,Rachel>and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini

155
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,740
<7-1,Rachel>各种尺寸和颜色都有
<7-1,Rachel>in a variety of sizes and colors and...

156
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,430
<7-1,Rachel>这跟我穿什么有何相干
<7-1,Rachel>What does it matter what I'm wearing?

157
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,140
<7-1,Rachel>可以请你的主管过来吗  谢谢
<7-1,Rachel>Could I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you.

158
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,140
<7-2,Ross>等着
<7-2,Ross>We're hold.

159
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,140
<7-3,Rachel>我的天  你来干什么
<7-3,Rachel>My God! What are you doing here?

160
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,930
<7-4,Ross>你说你不能出去  所以...
<7-4,Ross>Well, you said you couldn't go out, so....

161

<7-5,Sophie>你带了野餐篮  真是个好男朋友
<7-5,Sophie>You brought a picnic! What a boyfriend.

162
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,370
<7-5,Sophie>就这么定了  星期一我要开始化妆
<7-5,Sophie>That's it. On Monday, I start wearing makeup.

163
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,110
<7-6,Rachel>罗斯  亲爱的  你很体贴
<7-6,Rachel>Ross, honey, this is very nice,

164
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,040
<7-6,Rachel>但我现在大难临头
<7-6,Rachel>but I've got a crisis.

165
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,490
<7-7,Ross>但我这有蒸麦粉
<7-7,Ross>But I've got couscous!

166
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,540
<7-8,Rachel>亲爱的  对不起
<7-8,Rachel>Honey, I'm sorry,

167
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,790
<7-8,Rachel>我知道今天是我们周年纪念
<7-8,Rachel>I know it's our anniversary...

168
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,190
<7-8,Rachel>但我在电话里跟你说过  我没有时间停下来
<7-8,Rachel>but I told you on the phone, I don't have time to stop.

169
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,740
<7-9,Ross>你不必停下来  我是隐形人  看不到
<7-9,Ross>Okay, you don't have to stop. I'm invisible. I'm not here.

170
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,420
<7-9,Ross>对  可是  我不...
<7-9,Ross>Yeah, but I don't...

<7-10,Rachel>Who approved that order?

172
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,210
<7-10,Rachel>我们这里没有马克·罗宾逊
<7-10,Rachel>Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.

173
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,050
<7-10,Rachel>打电话给马克
<7-10,Rachel>Get me Mark on the phone!

<7-13,Rachel>让我看看手中的订单
<7-13,Rachel>Let me just check that with what I've got here.

177
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,250
<7-13,Rachel>038不是本店的号码
<7-13,Rachel>All right, see, 038 is not the number for this store.

178
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,060
<7-13,Rachel>那是亚特兰大的号码
<7-13,Rachel>038 is Atlanta.

<7-19,Rachel>有个小丑在这里捣乱
<7-19,Rachel>I've got Shemp in my office.

<7-20,Ross>但你电话讲完了  喝杯酒吧
<7-20,Ross>But somebody's off the phone! How about a glass of wine...

189
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,130
<7-20,Ross>围着火对饮  我可以再把火升起来
<7-20,Ross>by the fire? I can get it going again....

190
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,560
<7-21,Rachel>罗斯  你没有听我说话  我没空
<7-21,Rachel>Ross, you're not listening to me. I don't have time to stop.

196
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,730
<7-27,Rachel>听好了  我现在没空理你
<7-27,Rachel>Look, I cannot do this right now.

197
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,410
<7-27,Rachel>我的交货时间快到了
<7-27,Rachel>I've got a deadline!

<8-1,Ross>Actually, that's our three-hole punch.

201
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,110
<8-2,Rachel>刚才的事
<8-2,Rachel>Look, about what happened earlier.

202
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,770
<8-3,Ross>我完全了解  你的压力很大
<8-3,Ross>I completely understand. You were stressed.

203
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,950
<8-4,Rachel>我本来要给你机会向我道歉的
<8-4,Rachel>I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,850
<8-5,Ross>凭什么  凭你把我赶出办公室吗
<8-5,Ross>For what. For letting you throw me out of your office?

205
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,850
<8-6,Rachel>你没有权利到我办公室来  罗斯
<8-6,Rachel>You had no right coming down to my office, Ross.

206
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,550
<8-6,Rachel>你不能带着野餐篮到人家的办公室去
<8-6,Rachel>You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work...

207
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,180
<8-6,Rachel>除非那个人是公园管理员
<8-6,Rachel>unless maybe they're a park ranger!

208
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,540
<8-7,Ross>原谅我只想在周年纪念日跟女朋友在一起
<8-7,Ross>Excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

209
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,060
<8-7,Ross>老天  我真是混蛋
<8-7,Ross>Boy, what an ass am I!

210
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,110
<8-8,Rachel>但我说过我没有时间
<8-8,Rachel>But I told you I didn't have the time!

211
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,990
<8-9,Ross>你一直都没时间
<8-9,Ross>Well, you never have the time.

212
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,520
<8-9,Ross>我觉得自己好像根本没有女朋友  瑞秋
<8-9,Ross>I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,240
<8-10,Rachel>罗斯  你到底想让我怎么做
<8-10,Rachel>Ross, what do you want from me?

214
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
<8-10,Rachel>你是不是要我辞职
<8-10,Rachel>Do you want me to quit my job...

215
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,430
<8-10,Rachel>好让你觉得自己有女朋友
<8-10,Rachel>so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

216
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,880
<8-11,Ross>不  我只希望你了解这只是一份工作
<8-11,Ross>No, but it would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.

217
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,920
<8-12,Rachel>-只是一份工作  -没错
<8-12,Rachel>- Just a job? - Yes.

218
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,450
<8-14,Rachel>罗斯  这是我人生中第一次
<8-14,Rachel>Ross, do you realise it's the first time in my life

219
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,970
<8-14,Rachel>做我真正喜欢的事
<8-14,Rachel>I'm doing something I actually care about!

220
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,550
<8-14,Rachel>我这辈子第一次
<8-14,Rachel>This's the first time in my life

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,130
<8-14,Rachel>发挥自己的专长
<8-14,Rachel>I'm doing something I'm actually good at!

222
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,670
<8-14,Rachel>如果你不了解
<8-14,Rachel>If you don't get that...

223
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,070
<8-15,Ross>我了解  我非常了解  也为你高兴
<8-15,Ross>I get that, okay? I get that big time, and I'm happy for you.

224
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,720
<8-15,Ross>但我受够了跟你的答录机谈恋爱
<8-15,Ross>But I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!

225
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,230
<8-15,Ross>我不知道该怎么办
<8-15,Ross>I don't know what to do any more!

226
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,960
<8-16,Rachel>我也不知道
<8-16,Rachel>Well, neither do I!

227
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,040
<8-17,Ross>这是因为马克吗
<8-17,Ross>Is this about Mark?

228
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,590
<8-18,Rachel>我的天
<8-18,Rachel>Oh, my God!

229
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,610
<8-19,Ross>好  不是
<8-19,Ross>Okay, it's not.

230
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,170
<8-18,Rachel>我的老天爷
<8-18,Rachel>Oh, my God!

231
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,450
<8-20,Rachel>我不能总跟你为同一件事吵架  罗斯
<8-20,Rachel>I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.

232
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,260
<8-21,Ross>天哪  你让我受不了
<8-21,Ross>No, you're making this too hard.

233
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,230
<8-21,Ross>我让你受不了  你要我怎么做
<8-21,Ross>I'm making this too hard? Okay, what do you want me to do?

234

<12-6,Chandler>吃完饭不能游泳完全不可信
<12-6,Chandler>You know that swimming thing is a myth.

313
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,740
<13-1,Rachel>然后我们大吵了一架  弄得很僵

315
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,340
<13-3,Rachel>然后
<13-3,Rachel>And then...

316
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,820
<13-1,Rachel>我告诉他我想分开
<13-1,Rachel>I told him I wanted to take a break.

317
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,410
<13-1,Rachel>我不想分开
<13-1,Rachel>I don't want to take a break.

<13-3,Rachel>And then I called him and he wasn't there.

322
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,330
<13-4,Mark>他大概只是出去了
<13-4,Mark>He's probably just out.
