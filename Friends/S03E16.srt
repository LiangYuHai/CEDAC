<2-2,Rachel>you can feel like you got a girlfriend?

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,850
<2-3,Ross>-这是因为马克吗  -我的天
<2-3,Ross>- Is this about Mark? - Oh, my God.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,300
<2-4,Rachel>-好  不是  -我的老天爷
<2-4,Rachel>- Okay, it's not. - Oh, my God.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,560
<2-5,Ross>我不能总跟你为同一件事吵架  罗斯
<2-5,Ross>I cannot keep having the same fight with you, Ross!

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,770
<2-5,Ross>也许我们应该分开一下
<2-5,Ross>Look, maybe we should just take a break.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,790
<2-6,Rachel>很好  你说得对  我们冷静一下
<2-6,Rachel>Fine. You're right. Let's take a break.

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,500

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,140
<3-1,Rachel>我说我想分开

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,840
<3-1,Rachel>我不想分开
<3-1,Rachel>I don't want to take a break.

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,890
<3-2,Ross>我在想这太荒唐了
<3-2,Ross>I've been thinking, this is crazy.

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,770
<3-2,Ross>你不觉得我们可以再沟通吗
<3-2,Ross>Don't you think we can work on this?

109
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,560
<9-2,Joey>我们当时找不到你
<9-2,Joey>We figured when we couldn't find you,

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,000
<9-2,Joey>还以为你去跟瑞秋和好了
<9-2,Joey>you'd gone home to make up with Rachel.

111
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,670
<9-2,Joey>你当时应该那样做才对
<9-2,Joey>Which is probably what you should have done.

112
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,870
<9-2,Joey>你说呢
<9-2,Joey>You think?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,440
<9-3,Ross>老天  我完蛋了  我该怎么办
<9-3,Ross>God, I'm in hell. I mean, what am I gonna do?

114
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,930
<9-3,Ross>瑞秋一直说"我爱你"
<9-3,Ross>Rachel's all like "I love you",

115
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,970
<9-3,Ross>"我们要解决问题"
<9-3,Ross>and "Let's work on this"...

116
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,580
<9-3,Ross>而我满脑子都是
<9-3,Ross>and all I can think about...

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
<9-3,Ross>如果我把实情告诉她
<9-3,Ross>is what is she gonna do what she gonna say

118
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,470
<9-3,Ross>她会怎么做怎么说
<9-3,Ross>when I tell her what I did?

119
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,300
<9-4,Chandler>问答这个之前
<9-4,Chandler>Before we answer that,

120
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,810
<9-4,Chandler>我们应该谈比较重要的问题
<9-4,Chandler>I think we should address the more important question:

121
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,250
<9-4,Chandler>你到底有多蠢
<9-4,Chandler>how dumb are you?

122
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,590
<9-4,Chandler>怎么了
<9-4,Chandler>What?

123
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,410
<9-5,Ross>我们努力想修复这份感情  好吗
<9-5,Ross>Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?

124
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,830
<9-5,Ross>如果不诚实
<9-5,Ross>How am I supposed to do that without

125
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,520
<9-5,Ross>还谈什么感情
<9-5,Ross>being totally honest with each other?

126
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,810
<9-6,Joey>罗斯  我也赞成要坦诚  真的
<9-6,Joey>Ross, look. I'm onboard about the total-honesty thing. I am.

127
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,460
<9-6,Joey>不过会惹麻烦的事  还是少说为妙
<9-6,Joey>Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.

128
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,860
<9-7,Chandler>他说得对  这对谁都没好处
<9-7,Chandler>He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit,

129
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,830
<9-7,Chandler>你只会伤害她
<9-7,Chandler>and you'll just hurt her.

130
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,420
<9-8,Joey>到时候连感情都没了 还修复什么呢
<9-8,Joey>And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.

131
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,320
<9-9,Ross>对  可你不觉得
<9-9,Ross>Yeah, but don't you think...

132
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,010
<9-10,Chandler>如果你真的要非说不可
<9-10,Chandler>All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her,

133
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,030
<9-10,Chandler>至少要等到适当的时机
<9-10,Chandler>at least wait till the timing's right.

134
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,080
<9-10,Chandler>所以临终之前才要忏悔
<9-10,Chandler>And that's what deathbeds are for.

135
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,850
<9-11,Ross>-好吧  -很好
<9-11,Ross>- Yeah, okay. - All right.

136
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,590
<9-12,Joey>好了  我们必须确定
<9-12,Joey>Okay. Now, we just have to make sure

137
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,120
<9-12,Joey>她不会从其它的渠道知道
<9-12,Joey>she doesn't find out some other way.

138
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,300
<9-12,Joey>你有没有想到关联
<9-12,Joey>Did you think about the trail?

139
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,560
<9-13,Ross>什么关联
<9-13,Ross>What trail?

140
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,130
<9-14,Joey>从你勾搭的那个女人开始一路循迹
<9-14,Joey>The trail from the woman you did it with...

141
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,590
<9-14,Joey>直到你千方百计要隐瞒的女人
<9-14,Joey>to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!

142
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,100
<9-14,Joey>永远不要忘了关联
<9-14,Joey>You always have to think about the trail!

143
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,180
<9-15,Ross>我想应该没有什么关联吧
<9-15,Ross>I don't think there's any trail.

144
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,600
<9-15,Ross>好了好了
<9-15,Ross>Okay, okay...

145
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,200
<9-16,Chandler>克萝伊的同事艾塞克
<9-16,Chandler>Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,370
<9-16,Chandler>艾塞克的妹妹洁丝敏
<9-16,Chandler>Isaac's sister is Jasmine,

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,290
<9-16,Chandler>是菲比在按摩中心的同事
<9-16,Chandler>and Jasmine works at the massage place with Phoebe.

148
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,750
<9-16,Chandler>菲比是瑞秋的朋友
<9-16,Chandler>And Phoebe's friends with Rachel,

149
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,310
<9-16,Chandler>这就是关联  我找到了
<9-16,Chandler>and that's the trail! I did it!

150
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,180
<10-1,Phoebe>敷上"超脱"脱毛膏  把布条贴在腿上
<10-1,Phoebe>"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one"

151
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,380
<10-2,Monica>好了
<10-2,Monica>Did that!

152
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,890
<10-3,Phoebe>抓住布条的易撕端
<10-3,Phoebe>"Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy-grab tab...

153
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,950
<10-3,Phoebe>快速扯下来  完全无痛
<10-3,Phoebe>and pull it off in one quick, pain-free motion."

154
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,950
<10-4,Monica>好的
<10-4,Monica>Okay.

155
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,420
<10-5,Phoebe>这不是无痛的吗
<10-5,Phoebe>Was it not "pain-free"?

156
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,470
<10-5,Phoebe>不  痛死了
<10-5,Phoebe>No, it was pain-ful!

157
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,700
<10-6,Monica>我的天  这应该叫超痛脱一点点毛膏
<10-6,Monica>My God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax."

158
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,770
<10-7,Phoebe>广告上穿缎子睡衣的女孩们
<10-7,Phoebe>Well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial...

159
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,140
<10-7,Phoebe>好像不觉得有这么痛
<10-7,Phoebe>don't seem to think it's that bad.

160
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,850
<10-8,Monica>那是因为她们太笨
<10-8,Monica>That's because their nerves are probably deadened

161
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,690
<10-8,Monica>所以神经都很大条
<10-8,Monica>from being so stupid.

162
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,970
<10-8,Monica>如果你不相信我的话  尽管自己试试看
<10-8,Monica>But you know, if you don't believe me, please, be my guest.

163
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
<10-9,Phoebe>我的妈呀
<10-9,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

164
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,430
<10-10,Monica>这下你该庆幸我们没贴比基尼条了吧
<10-10,Monica>Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?

165
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
<11-1,Ross>克萝伊  嗨
<11-1,Ross>Chloe, hi.

166
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,560
<11-2,Chloe>是因为我拿走你的手表吗
<11-2,Chloe>Is this about me taking your watch?

167
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,900
<11-3,Ross>你拿了我的手表
<11-3,Ross>You took my watch?

168
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,600
<11-4,Chloe>对不起  我有这种习惯
<11-4,Chloe>I'm sorry. I do that.

169
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,700
<11-5,Ross>你留着吧
<11-5,Ross>You keep it.

170
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,470
<11-5,Ross>听我说  你把我们的事跟别人说了吗
<11-5,Ross>Listen, did you tell anyone about us?

171
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,690
<11-6,Chloe>没有  我觉得不关别人的事
<11-6,Chloe>Oh, no, I feel like it really isn't anybody's business. You know?

172
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,580
<11-7,Ross>没错  那你也没有告诉艾塞克吧
<11-7,Ross>Exactly. So you didn't mention anything to Isaac right?

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,090
<11-8,Chloe>我什么事都告诉艾塞克
<11-8,Chloe>I tell Isaac everything.

174
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,350
<11-9,Ross>真的  那当然啦
<11-9,Ross>You do? Of course you do.

<11-9,Ross>我们还没有正式见过面
<11-9,Ross>You know, we haven't actually met.

177
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,040
<11-10,Issac>你个色狗
<11-10,Issac>You dog!

178
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,210
<11-11,Ross>对  我想我是狗
<11-11,Ross>Yes, I suppose I am a dog.

179
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,110
<11-11,Ross>不过艾塞克  我有个女朋友
<11-11,Ross>But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.

<11-14,Issac>我知道  不管我们有多爱她们
<11-14,Issac>Oh, hey, man, I know. It doesn't matter how much we love them.

183
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,320
<11-14,Issac>一夫一妻制真是太没有天理了
<11-14,Issac>Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

184
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,600
<11-15,Ross>听我说  可以请你保守这个秘密吗
<11-15,Ross>Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?

185

<11-16,Issac>没问题  我们要互相关照才行
<11-16,Issac>No problem dude. We gotta look out for each other.

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
<21-5,Rachel>然后收到你的留言  我好高兴
<21-5,Rachel>and then I got your message and I was so happy.

269
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,780
<31-1,Ross>我一心只想
<31-1,Ross>And all I wanted was to

270
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,390
<31-1,Ross>尽快把她赶出我的公寓

<31-2,Rachel>你的小女朋友是几点离开的
<31-2,Rachel>What time did your little friend leave?

273
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,610
<31-2,Rachel>我的天  她在场  她那时还在你家
<31-2,Rachel>Oh, my God. She was there? She was still there?

274
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,870
<31-2,Rachel>我在你家的时候  她也在场
<31-2,Rachel>She was in there when I was in there?

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,150
<31-3,Ross>听我说  重点是她对我毫无意义
<31-3,Ross>Listen, the important thing is she meant nothing to me.

276
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,860
<31-4,Rachel>却值得你为她破坏我们的关系
<31-4,Rachel>And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!

277
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,630
<31-5,Ross>那时候我不知道我们还有关系
<31-5,Ross>I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise.

278
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,920
<31-5,Ross>我以为我们分手了
<31-5,Ross>I thought we were broken up.

279
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,960
<31-6,Rachel>只是暂时分开一下
<31-6,Rachel>We were on a break.

280
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,220
<31-7,Ross>对我来说  那可能是一辈子
<31-7,Ross>That, for all I knew would, could last forever.

281
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,620
<31-7,Ross>对于我来说那就是分手
<31-7,Ross>That to me is a breakup.

282
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,930
<31-8,Rachel>你想通过揪字眼来推卸责任吗
<31-8,Rachel>You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?

283
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,290
<31-9,Ross>听着  我没有推卸责任
<31-9,Ross>Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay.

284
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,090
<31-9,Ross>我以为我们的关系完了
<31-9,Ross>I thought our relationship was dead.

285
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,170
<31-10,Rachel>所以你马上就去享艳福了
<31-10,Rachel>Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.

286
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,140
<32-1,Joey>我想我们不该再听下去了
<32-1,Joey>Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.

287
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,260
<32-2,Monica>你干嘛  我们不能出去
<32-2,Monica>What are you doing? We can't go out there.

288
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
<32-3,Joey>为什么不行  我饿了
<32-3,Joey>Why not? I'm hungry.

289
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,540
<32-4,Monica>因为他们会知道我们在偷听
<32-4,Monica>Because they'll know we've been listening.

290
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,670
<33-1,Rachel>老天  我还得从甘瑟那里听到这件事
<33-1,Rachel>God! And I have to hear about it from Gunther!

291
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,980
<33-2,Ross>拜托  好像我很期待让他告诉你似的
<33-2,Ross>Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you,

292
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,060
<33-2,Ross>我到处奔波  就是不想让你知道
<33-2,Ross>I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!

293
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,260
<33-3,Rachel>你好体贴

<33-3,Rachel>I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.

295
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,330
<34-1,Chandler>我觉得我们可以出去
<34-1,Chandler>Y'know what, I think we can go out there.

296
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,240
<34-1,Chandler>他们有其它更重要的事要担心
<34-1,Chandler>I mean they have more important things to worry about.

297
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,420
<34-2,Joey>对啊  不会有事的
<34-2,Joey>Yeah, we'll be fine.

<34-2,Joey>瑞秋  我本来想告诉你的
<34-2,Joey>Rachel, I wanted to tell you.

299
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,380
<35-1,Ross>我觉得我应该告诉你  真的
<35-1,Ross>I thought I should. I did.

300
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,510
<35-1,Ross>但是钱德勒和乔伊叫我不要说
<35-1,Ross>And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!

301
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,380
<35-1,Ross>把门用腊条封起来  我们再也不走了
<35-1,Ross>Wax the door shut. We're never leaving.

<42-2,Chandler>他们非和好不可
<42-2,Chandler>They've got to.

343
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,970
<42-3,Monica>万一他们不能和好呢
<42-3,Monica>What if they don't?

344
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,320
<42-4,Joey>你们觉得我需要新的走路姿势吗
<42-4,Joey>You think I need a new walk?

345
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,770
<42-5,Chandler>什么
<42-5,Chandler>What?

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,800
<42-6,Joey>我从高中开始  走路的姿势都一样
<42-6,Joey>Well, I've been walking the same way since high school.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
<42-6,Joey>你知道有些人一踏进房间
<42-6,Joey>You know how some guys walk into a room

348
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,790
<42-6,Joey>就吸引所有人的目光
<42-6,Joey>and everybody takes notice?

349
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,540
<42-6,Joey>我想我需要这种万众瞩目的走路姿势
<42-6,Joey>I think I need a take-notice walk.

350
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,810
<42-7,Chandler>你说这些话过大脑了吗
<42-7,Chandler>Are you actually saying these words?

351
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,920
<42-8,Ross>你现在连话都不跟我说了吗
<42-8,Ross>What, now you're not even talking to me?

352
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,330
<42-8,Ross>听我说  瑞秋  对不起
<42-8,Ross>Look, Rachel, I'm sorry. Ok?

353
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,250
<42-8,Ross>我很抱歉  我当时疯了
<42-8,Ross>I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

354
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,690
<42-8,Ross>我以为我会失去你  我不知道如何是好
<42-8,Ross>I thought I'd lost you. I didn't know what to do. Come on!

355
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,020
<42-8,Ross>不是疯到一定程度我绝不会做这种事
<42-8,Ross>Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this?

356
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,010
<42-8,Ross>我从不偷情  不是吗
<42-8,Ross>I don't cheat, right?

357
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,190
<42-8,Ross>我不是这种人  我不是乔伊
<42-8,Ross>That's not me. I'm not Joey!

358
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,940
<43-1,Joey>好吧  算了
<43-1,Joey>Yeah, okay.

359
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,820
<43-2,Monica>凌晨三点了
<43-2,Monica>It's three in the morning.

360
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,090
<43-2,Monica>他们都没意识到我已经回家了
<43-2,Monica>They don't know that I've come home yet.

361
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,210
<43-2,Monica>他俩谁都没奇怪我到哪里去了
<43-2,Monica>You notice how neither one of them aren't wondering where I am?

362
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,220
<43-3,Phoebe>人有时候就是只想到自己
<43-3,Phoebe>You know, people can be so self-involved.

363
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
<43-3,Phoebe>你知道吗
<43-3,Phoebe>You know what? You know what?

364
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,350
<44-1,Ross>不是我要分开一下的
<44-1,Ross>I'm not the one that wanted that break.

365
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,020
<44-1,Ross>是你放弃我们的  是你
<44-1,Ross>You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one

366
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,820
<44-1,Ross>在事情稍有不顺的时候  就调头逃跑
<44-1,Ross>that ran the moment when things got just a little rough.

367
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,950
<44-3,Ross>-那  -那怎么样
<44-3,Ross>- That's... - That's what?

368
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,760
<44-4,Rachel>-这根本不是重点  -现在我们
<44-4,Rachel>- That is neither here nor there. - Okay, well here we are.

369
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,410
<44-5,Ross>又到了进退两难的时刻  瑞秋
<44-5,Ross>Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach.

370
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,590
<44-5,Ross>你打算怎么办  你要怎么办
<44-5,Ross>What do you wanna do? How do you want to handle it?

371
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,460
<44-5,Ross>是努力解决问题  还是放弃
<44-5,Ross>Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?

372
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,410
<44-5,Ross>听着  我
<44-5,Ross>Look, I,

373
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,100
<44-5,Ross>我做了一件很过分
<44-5,Ross>I did a terrible,

374
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,760
<44-5,Ross>很蠢很蠢的事  好吗
<44-5,Ross>stupid, stupid thing, okay?

375
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,820
<44-5,Ross>对不起  我希望能收回这个错误
<44-5,Ross>I'm sorry. I wish I could take it back,

376
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,000
<44-5,Ross>但不可能
<44-5,Ross>but I can't.

377
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,880
<44-5,Ross>我只是不能眼睁睁看着彼此放弃
<44-5,Ross>I just can't see us throwing away

378
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,600
<44-5,Ross>明知道很美好的感情
<44-5,Ross>something we know is so damn good.

379
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,520
<44-5,Ross>瑞秋  我好爱你
<44-5,Ross>Rachel, I love you so much.

380
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,510
<44-6,Rachel>不要  罗斯  不要
<44-6,Rachel>No, Ross! Don't!

381
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,730
<44-6,Rachel>你不能吻我两下  就让整件事烟消云散
<44-6,Rachel>You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away.

382
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,670
<44-6,Rachel>事情不是这样的  这样没有用的  明白吗
<44-6,Rachel>It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?

383
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,210
<44-7,Ross>好吧  好吧
<44-7,Ross>Okay, okay, okay.

384
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,790
<44-8,Rachel>我觉得你应该离开
<44-8,Rachel>I think you should go.

385
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,010
<44-9,Ross>什么
<44-9,Ross>What?

386
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,310
<44-10,Rachel>我真的觉得你该走了
<44-10,Rachel>I really think you need to go now.

387
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,820
<44-10,Rachel>好吧
<44-10,Rachel>Okay, okay.

388
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,420
<44-11,Ross>今天早上你还说我们同心协力
<44-11,Ross>This morning you said there was nothing so big

389
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,460
<44-11,Ross>没有过不去的难关
<44-11,Ross>that we couldn't work past it together.

390
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,180
<44-12,Rachel>我那时候知道什么
<44-12,Rachel>What the hell did I know?

391
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,370
<44-13,Ross>我们一定有办法度过这一关  好吗
<44-13,Ross>Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay.

392
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,750
<44-13,Ross>我不能想像没有你的日子
<44-13,Ross>I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you.

393
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,660
<44-13,Ross>知道吗  没有...
<44-13,Ross>You know. Without,

394
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,210
<44-13,Ross>没有这双手臂
<44-13,Ross>without these arms,

395
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,030
<44-13,Ross>你的面容和你的心
<44-13,Ross>and your face, and this heart.

396

<44-13,Ross>你善良的心  瑞秋
<44-13,Ross>your good heart, Rach, and....

397
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,860
<46-2,Joey>不  我办不到
<46-2,Joey>No. I can't,

398
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,640
<44-14,Rachel>你在我眼里完全变了
<44-14,Rachel>you're a totally different person to me now.

399
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,210
<44-14,Rachel>我以前总觉得  你永远永远
<44-14,Rachel>I used to think of you as somebody

400
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,990
<44-14,Rachel>不会伤害我
<44-14,Rachel>that would never, ever hurt me.

401
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,580
<44-14,Rachel>永远不会
<44-14,Rachel>Ever.

402
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,760
<44-14,Rachel>天哪  现在我满脑子都是你跟她的画面
<44-14,Rachel>God, and now I just can't stop picturing you with her.

403
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,380
<44-14,Rachel>我做不到  你说什么
<44-14,Rachel>I can't. It doesn't matter what you say

404
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,280
<44-14,Rachel>做什么都没用  罗斯
<44-14,Rachel>or what you do, Ross.

405
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,610
<44-14,Rachel>一切都不能回头了
<44-14,Rachel>It's just changed, everything.

406
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,260
<44-14,Rachel>永远不能
<44-14,Rachel>Forever.

407
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,040
<44-15,Ross>不可能会这样
<44-15,Ross>Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.

408
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,920
<44-16,Rachel>那为什么会这样呢
<44-16,Rachel>Then how come it is?

409
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,580
<45-1,Phoebe>他们好久没动静了
<45-1,Phoebe>They've been quiet for a long time.

410
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,560
<45-2,Joey>也许她把他杀了
<45-2,Joey>Maybe she killed him.

411
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,320
<45-3,Chandler>我们走吧
<45-3,Chandler>Let's go.

412
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,840
<46-1,Chandler>这是你新的走路姿势吗
<46-1,Chandler>Is that your new walk?
