1

<1-6,Monica>No, Rachel's meeting us here!

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,690
<1-7,Phoebe>拜托  他们还是可以共处一室吧
<1-7,Phoebe>Come on! They can be in the same room.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,000
<1-9,Phoebe>-你昨晚可是没看到  -现在又怎么了
<1-9,Phoebe>- You should've been there last night. - Why? What happened now?

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,570
<1-10,Joey>罗斯在我们那边
<1-10,Joey>Ross was hanging out at our place.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,560
<1-10,Joey>瑞秋来跟钱德勒借保湿霜
<1-10,Joey>Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturizer from Chandler.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,490
<1-11,Chandler>喂  你就不能说借"东西"吗
<1-11,Chandler>Hey y-you, how hard is it to say "something"?

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,750
<1-11,Chandler>瑞秋过来借"东西"
<1-11,Chandler>Rachel came over to borrow "something".

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,260
<1-12,Joey>反正她和罗斯就开始对骂
<1-12,Joey>Anyway, her and Ross just started yelling at each other.

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,210
<1-13,Phoebe>他怎么敢骂她
<1-13,Phoebe>Wait. Why was he yelling at her?

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,830
<1-13,Phoebe>跟别人上床的人明明是他
<1-13,Phoebe>He’s the one who slept with someone else.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,040
<1-14,Joey>我记得他说
<1-14,Joey>Well, I guess he says that

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,920
<1-14,Joey>因为当时他们已经分手了
<1-14,Joey>because they were on a break when it happened...

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,850
<1-14,Joey>所以她现在就该原谅他了
<1-14,Joey>that she should’ve forgiven him by now.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,030
<1-15,Phoebe>他真不可理喻  真是的
<1-15,Phoebe>He is so unreasonable! God!

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,230
<1-15,Phoebe>不过我了解他的意思
<1-15,Phoebe>Although I think I understand what he means.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,980
<1-15,Phoebe>天哪  这就好比《60分钟》上的新闻
<1-15,Phoebe>Oh, my God! This is like 60 Minutes, okay.

22
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,660
<1-15,Phoebe>一开始你非常生气
<1-15,Phoebe>when, when, at first you're really mad at

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,710
<1-15,Phoebe>制药公司生产那些药
<1-15,Phoebe>that pharmaceutical company for making the drug.

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,870
<1-15,Phoebe>后来你又很同情那些人  因为
<1-15,Phoebe>And then, y'know you just feel bad for the people because...

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,570
<1-15,Phoebe>他们很需要让头发长出来
<1-15,Phoebe>they needed to make their hair grow.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,400
<1-16,Chandler>你们知道这像什么吗
<1-16,Chandler>Y'know what this is like?

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,290
<1-16,Chandler>这像我父母离婚时的情景
<1-16,Chandler>This is like when my parents got divorced.

28
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,310
<1-16,Chandler>希望童子军活动结束后
<1-16,Chandler>Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,930
<1-16,Chandler>罗斯不会企图绑架我
<1-16,Chandler>after Cub Scouts.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,300
<1-17,Phoebe>我做梦梦到罗斯和瑞秋
<1-17,Phoebe>Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,010
<1-17,Phoebe>仍是一对  从未闹过分手
<1-17,Phoebe>were still together, they never broke up.

32
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,200
<1-17,Phoebe>我们在一起玩  大家都很开心
<1-17,Phoebe>And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy.

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
<1-18,Joey>我也梦到了
<1-18,Joey>I had the same dream.

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,500
<1-19,Phoebe>也没人跟那个影印店的女孩上过床
<1-19,Phoebe>Yeah, and nobody slept with the Xerox girl.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,800
<1-20,Joey>我的刚好相反
<1-20,Joey>Oh, I had the opposite dream.

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,460
<1-21,Chandler>也许会慢慢好起来的
<1-21,Chandler>Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay.

<1-23,Monica>to get over a relationship.

40
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,100
<1-23,Monica>你忘情的时间比你洗澡的时间都短
<1-23,Monica>It never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship.

<11-44,Rachel>不  我觉得错的是谁其实非常明显
<11-44,Rachel>No, I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.

390

393
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,990
