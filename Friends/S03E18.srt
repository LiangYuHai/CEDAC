22
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,070
<1-20,Rachel>然后用屁股玩赛车游戏

<4-8,Pete>你也觉得她应该和我约会吧
<4-8,Pete>Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,220
<4-9,Rachel>假发乱成一团  假胸扔在床头柜上
<4-9,Rachel>That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.

133
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,170
<4-10,Monica>你考虑一下
<4-10,Monica>I mean, really, think about it.

136
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,900
<5-1,Phoebe>我不想妄下断论  但这太变态了
<5-1,Phoebe>I don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick.

137
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,470
<5-1,Phoebe>而且大错特错
<5-1,Phoebe>It's sick and wrong!

138
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,040
<5-2,Ross>菲比  怎么了  因为年龄吗
<5-2,Ross>Pheebs. What, is it the age thing?

139
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,950
<5-3,Phoebe>我本来不在乎年龄
<5-3,Phoebe>No, no, I'm fine with the age thing...

140
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,190
<5-3,Phoebe>直到她把舌头伸进我弟的喉咙
<5-3,Phoebe>until it sticks its tongue down my little brother's throat.

141
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,870
<5-4,Joey>菲比  他看起来很爽

<5-5,Phoebe>等他忙着帮
<5-5,Phoebe>I mean you think he's gonna enjoy it

<5-5,Phoebe>when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,170
<5-5,Phoebe>你觉得他还会爽吗
<5-5,Phoebe>of all the babies they have to have right away?

145
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,690
<5-5,Phoebe>这样对弗兰克不公平  也对宝宝不公平
<5-5,Phoebe>This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.

146
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,340
<5-5,Phoebe>你知道吗  这也不是好的家政
<5-5,Phoebe>You know what? It's not good home economics.

<5-7,Phoebe>Yes. Not out loud.

149
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,500
<5-8,Ross>菲比  如果你不说
<5-8,Ross>Pheebs, if you don't tell him,

150
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,140
<5-8,Ross>他就要结婚了  你会恨你自己的
<5-8,Ross>soon he's gonna be married, then you're gonna hate yourself.

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,660
<5-9,Phoebe>我要是说了  他会恨我
<5-9,Phoebe>Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,220
<5-9,Phoebe>你看看他和他妈妈  我不能说
<5-9,Phoebe>Look at him and his mom. I can't.

232
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,950
<8-4,Ross>我帮他拿戒指
<8-4,Ross>I'm the ring bearer.

233
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,740
<8-4,Ross>爱丽丝  多谢  你来了就好
<8-4,Ross>Alice, hi, thanks. I'm so glad you could come.

234
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,290
<9-1,Phoebe>我有一个家政惨案
<9-1,Phoebe>Because I've got a real home-ec emergency.

235
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,010
<9-2,Alice>天哪  谁死了
<9-2,Alice>Oh, my God. Who died on this?

236
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,270
<9-3,Phoebe>芥末酱倒了
<9-3,Phoebe>It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."

237
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,080
<9-3,Phoebe>你有办法吗
<9-3,Phoebe>Can you help me?

238
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,070
<9-4,Alice>当然有  先用苏打水加盐清洗
<9-4,Alice>Absolutely. Okay first, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.

239
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,350
<9-4,Alice>要是洗不掉  就可以试着
<9-4,Alice>Then if that doesn't work, then we can go back to...

240
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,860
<9-5,Phoebe>算了  已经毁了
<9-5,Phoebe>You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,220
<9-6,Alice>别这么说
<9-6,Alice>No, no, never say that.

242
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,660
<9-6,Alice>要是洗不掉  就剪掉脏污部分
<9-6,Alice>If you can't get it out, then you can cut around the stain...

243
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,160
<9-6,Alice>缝一点蕾丝  就是一条漂亮的盖毯
<9-6,Alice>add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.

244
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,350
<9-7,Phoebe>又或者  你可以不要嫁给我弟弟弗兰克
<9-7,Phoebe>Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank?

245
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,400
<9-7,Phoebe>很好
<9-7,Phoebe>Okay, that's great.

246
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,900
<10-1,Pete>能再小些吗  小到可以放在针尖上
<10-1,Pete>But can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin?

247
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,890
<10-1,Pete>我喜欢生产这种小东西
<10-1,Pete>I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.

248
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,890
<10-2,All>-明白  -好的

<10-5,Monica>What the hell is this?

252

<10-6,Pete>I'm sorry. What?

255
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,410
<10-7,Monica>说真的  这是什么意思
<10-7,Monica>Seriously. What's this supposed to mean?

256
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,760
<10-8,Pete>我一直不会算小费
<10-8,Pete>Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.

257
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,140
<10-9,Monica>把税乘以二  不是把罗马尼亚的税收乘以二
<10-9,Monica>You suppose to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania.

258
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,300
<10-9,Monica>什么意思  你要收买我吗
<10-9,Monica>What's the deal? Are you trying to buying me?

259
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,440
<10-9,Monica>你都这样约女孩子吗
<10-9,Monica>Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?

260
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,810
<10-10,Employee>我还在
<10-10,Employee>I'm still here.

261
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,650
<10-11,Pete>你误会了  要是我没给这笔小费
<10-11,Pete>You're taking this all wrong. If I didn't leave you that tip...

262
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,980
<10-11,Pete>你就不会来  我们不会争吵
<10-11,Pete>you wouldn't have come down here, we wouldn't have this argument...

263
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,600
<10-11,Pete>-也不会有这种紧张的气氛  -什么
<10-11,Pete>- and there wouldn't be this heat between us. - What?

264
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,630
<10-13,Pete>你得承认
<10-13,Pete>Come on, you gotta admit

265
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,960
<10-13,Pete>我们的关系有进展了
<10-13,Pete>that our relationship is hitting a new level now.

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,430
<10-13,Pete>以前你是厨师  我是顾客
<10-13,Pete>'Cause you used to be like the chef and I was the customer.

267
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,300
<10-13,Pete>现在我们是两个争吵的人
<10-13,Pete>But now we're like this couple that fights.

268

<10-14,Monica>你是个疯子
<10-14,Monica>Okay, you're a loon.

<10-18,Monica>我不想鼓励这种行为
<10-18,Monica>I don't wanna encourage this kind of behavior.

275
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,110
<10-19,Pete>我只求一顿饭  好吗
<10-19,Pete>One meal. That's all I'm asking for. Please?

280
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,650
<11-3,Frank>你的衣服好香  我就窝在里面
<11-3,Frank>Your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.

281
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,540
<11-3,Frank>-没关系吧  -没关系
<11-3,Frank>- Is that all right? - Yeah, sure.

282
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,080
<11-4,Phoebe>今天过得怎样
<11-4,Phoebe>So how was your day?

283
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,150
<11-5,Frank>可能是我有生以来最惨的一天
<11-5,Frank>It's just probably the worst one since I've been alive.

284
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,620
<11-6,Phoebe>怎么了
<11-6,Phoebe>What? What happened?

285
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,890
<11-7,Frank>爱丽丝改变心意了
<11-7,Frank>Alice.... She called it off.

286
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,700
<11-7,Frank>不是吧
<11-7,Frank>Oh, no.

287
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,990
<11-8,Phoebe>她有说原因吗
<11-8,Phoebe>Did she say why?

288
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,520
<11-9,Frank>没有  她只说我太年轻
<11-9,Frank>No not really. Just that I was too young.

289
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,330
<11-9,Frank>我怎么突然变年轻了
<11-9,Frank>You know but I don't see how I could suddenly be too young...

290
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,540
<11-9,Frank>我可比我们刚交往时老成不少
<11-9,Frank>because I'm older than I was when we first got together.

291
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,480
<11-9,Frank>是的是的  我知道
<11-9,Frank>Yeah, yeah, I know.

292
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,050
<11-10,Phoebe>不知道  但是你知道吗
<11-10,Phoebe>I don't know. But you know what?

293
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,700
<11-10,Phoebe>或许这样也好
<11-10,Phoebe>Maybe it's just all for the best.

294
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,080
<11-11,Frank>是啊  如果"好"就是我好痛苦的话
<11-11,Frank>Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.

295
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,800
<11-12,Phoebe>亲爱的
<11-12,Phoebe>Oh, sweetie.

296
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,210
<11-12,Phoebe>我好不容易感到快乐
<11-12,Phoebe>You know, I was just finally happy.

297
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,000
<11-13,Frank>这是生平第一次
<11-13,Frank>You know, for the first time in my life...

298
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,620
<11-13,Frank>先是爸爸离开我
<11-13,Frank>after my dad left me...

299
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,650
<11-13,Frank>然后偷鸟被逮捕
<11-13,Frank>and then and then getting arrested for stealing those birds...

300
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,830
<11-13,Frank>然后又肺穿孔
<11-13,Frank>and then the whole punctured-lung thing.

301
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,450
<11-13,Frank>天气一冷  我还是很难深呼吸
<11-13,Frank>It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...

302
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,460
<11-13,Frank>但是有了爱丽丝  这些都不见了
<11-13,Frank>but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.

303
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,860
<11-13,Frank>现在我失去了  却不知道原因
<11-13,Frank>And now and now it's gone, and I don't know why.

304
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,180
<11-14,Phoebe>我可以告诉你原因  是我害的
<11-14,Phoebe>Well, I can tell you why. It's because of me.

305
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,730
<11-14,Phoebe>不过我是爱你才这么做的  好吗
<11-14,Phoebe>But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?

306
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,090
<11-15,Frank>什么
<11-15,Frank>What?

307
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,910
<11-16,Phoebe>我跟爱丽丝聊了一下
<11-16,Phoebe>I kind of had a little chat with Alice...

308
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,080
<11-16,Phoebe>让她明白你们为何不能在一起
<11-16,Phoebe>and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.

309
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,310
<11-16,Phoebe>你总有一天也会明白的  真的
<11-16,Phoebe>And you're gonna see it too, one day. You really, really will.

310
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,910
<11-17,Frank>等一下  是你造成的
<11-17,Frank>Wait a minute. This is because of you?

311
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,460
<11-18,Phoebe>-好了  -等等
<11-18,Phoebe>- Okay. - Wait, no.

312
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,700
<11-19,Frank>我妈反对我们在一起
<11-19,Frank>My mother didn't want us to be together...

313
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,110
<11-19,Frank>但是她顶多把我绑在门廊上
<11-19,Frank>but the worst thing she every did was tie me to the porch.

314
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
<11-20,Phoebe>但是...
<11-20,Phoebe>Okay, but...

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,940
<11-21,Frank>我觉得你能了解  所以才来找你
<11-21,Frank>You know what? I came to you because I thought you'd understand.

316
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,560
<11-21,Frank>怎么会
<11-21,Frank>No!

317
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,860
<11-21,Frank>知道吗
<11-21,Frank>You know?

318
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,680
<11-21,Frank>我很想立刻摔门走人
<11-21,Frank>I would storm out of here right now...

319
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,230
<11-21,Frank>但是我没钱  没地方去
<11-21,Frank>if I had some money or a place to go.

320
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,960
<12-1,Rachel>天哪  百万富翁来了
<12-1,Rachel>Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

321

<12-3,Monica>Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him, okay?

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,760
<12-4,Chandler>好吧记住了  他请你吃饭
<12-4,Chandler>Okay, just because he buys you dinner

324
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,240
<12-4,Chandler>并不代表你欠他什么
<12-4,Chandler>does not mean you owe him anything.

325
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,750
<12-5,Monica>我知道
<12-5,Monica>I know.

326
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,020
<12-6,Chandler>那记得点龙虾
<12-6,Chandler>Okay, then get the lobster.

327
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,970
<12-8,Pete>你口袋里有多少现金
<12-8,Pete>How much cash you got in your pocket now?

328
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,670
<12-11,Ross>所以我就不请你进来喝一杯了
<12-11,Ross>And that's why I'm not inviting you in for a drink.

329
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,770
<12-13,Monica>-拜  -进来坐一下嘛

<12-13,Monica>-听起来不错  -有一家馆子不错
<12-13,Monica>- That sounds great. - I know a great little place.

332
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,060
<13-1,Pete>我不能让你付比萨钱
<13-1,Pete>You're not paying for the pizza.

333
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,370
<13-2,Monica>我付吧  这样才公平  你出了机票钱
<13-2,Monica>Come on, it's only fair. You paid for the flight.

334
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,880

<13-5,Pete>-这些是多少  -大约六毛美金
