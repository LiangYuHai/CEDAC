91
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,110
<4-6,Rachel>我想现在我会拒绝任何人

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,410
<4-6,Rachel>仿佛那样是背叛罗斯似的
<4-6,Rachel>You know like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

96
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,030
<4-7,Phoebe>也许这代表  你还没对罗斯忘情
<4-7,Phoebe>Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that you're not over Ross yet

97
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,770
<4-7,Phoebe>而且还有恋父情结
<4-7,Phoebe>and you have issues with your father.

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,490
<4-8,Rachel>我没有恋父情结

99
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,230

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,390
<5-6,Ross>发现没有我的人生
<5-6,Ross>and she realizes that life without me...

<7-3,Phoebe>You know what? You should buy a state...

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,000
<7-3,Phoebe>然后用你的名字给它命名
<7-3,Phoebe>and then just name it after yourself.

160
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,770
<7-4,Pete>比如"彼特达科他州"
<7-4,Pete>Like, "Pete Dakota"?

161
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,630
<7-5,Phoebe>或是"密西西彼特州"
<7-5,Phoebe>Or "Mississi-Pete."

162
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,460
<7-6,Joey>我想到了  "彼芝加哥"
<7-6,Joey>I got it: "Pete Chicago."

163
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,220
<7-7,Chandler>芝加哥不是州  乔伊
<7-7,Chandler>That's not a state, Joe.

164
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,210
<7-8,Joey>那"密西西彼特"就是吗
<7-8,Joey>Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

<7-13,Monica>我快要没地方可以摸了
<7-13,Monica>Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him.

170
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,400
<7-13,Monica>我是有什么毛病吗
<7-13,Monica>Is something wrong with me?

171
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,930
<7-13,Monica>为何我总是喜欢与之没有未来的人
<7-13,Monica>Why am I only attracted to guys with there's no future?

172
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,630
<7-13,Monica>不是太老  就是太小
<7-13,Monica>Either they're too old, or they're too young.

173
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,600
<7-13,Monica>而彼特这么喜欢我
<7-13,Monica>And there's Pete, who's crazy about me......

174
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,500
<7-13,Monica>又这么完美  我却一点感觉也没有
<7-13,Monica>and he's absolutely perfect, and there's zip going on!

175
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,230
<7-13,Monica>真的  你们觉得我是不是有什么毛病
<7-13,Monica>Seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?

176
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,470
<7-13,Monica>好像是有点
<7-13,Monica>Yeah, kind of.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,360
<8-1,Kate>开心  我应该感到开心吗  维克
<8-1,Kate>Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic?

178
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,020
<8-1,Kate>开心
<8-1,Kate>Happy?

179
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,450
<8-2,Joey>不如你来告诉我你该有什么感觉
<8-2,Joey>Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,600
<8-2,Joey>因为我实在搞不懂
<8-2,Joey>Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,140
<8-2,Joey>我们的交谈没有感情
<8-2,Joey>I talk to you, and nothing!

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,610
<8-2,Joey>你看着我的眼神没有感情
<8-2,Joey>You look at me, and it's nothing!

183
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,050
<8-2,Joey>一点都没有
<8-2,Joey>Nothing.

184
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,490
<8-3,The Director>有意思
<8-3,The Director>Tasty.

185
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,820
<8-3,The Director>我开始觉得你们有渊源了  很好
<8-3,The Director>I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's nice.

186
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,290
<8-4,Kate>-我对这场戏有个疑问  -怎样
<8-4,Kate>- I have a question about this scene. - Yes?

187
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,180
<8-6,Kate>我不理解爱德莉安为什么会喜欢维克多
<8-6,Kate>I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.

188
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,260
<8-7,The Director>抽丝剥茧
<8-7,The Director>Peel the onion.

189
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,760
<8-7,The Director>首先  他很帅
<8-7,The Director>First of all, he's good-looking.

190
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,170
<8-9,Kate>我的角色需要更好的理由
<8-9,Kate>I think my character needs a little bit more of a reason than that.

191
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,760
<8-10,Joey>我来告诉你个理由  因为剧本这么写的
<8-10,Joey>Hey, how about this one? It says so in the script!

192
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,530
<8-10,Joey>我也不明白我的角色为什么喜欢你
<8-10,Joey>You know I don't know why my character likes you either.

193
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,370
<8-10,Joey>剧本上说你是个贱人
<8-10,Joey>I mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.

194
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,520
<8-11,Kate>-剧本上没写  -我这本有
<8-11,Kate>- It doesn't say that in the script. - It does in mine.

195
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,450
<9-1,Chandler>我吹干  上发胶  还是一样
<9-1,Chandler>I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.

196
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,330
<9-1,Chandler>头顶上还是有一撮
<9-1,Chandler>I still wind up with this little...

197
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,580
<9-1,Chandler>梳不平的头发  烦死人了
<9-1,Chandler>cowlick-y thing on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,630
<9-2,Ross>-你看了烦不烦  -你比较烦
<9-2,Ross>- Does it bug you? - You bug me.

199
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,430
<9-3,Chandler>你会不会刚好没看到
<9-3,Chandler>Is there any chance you didn't see that?

200
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,150
<9-3,Chandler>罗斯  别再看了
<9-3,Chandler>Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

201
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,390
<9-3,Chandler>你不能在猫眼那儿瞄上三小时
<9-3,Chandler>You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.

202
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,400
<10-1,Chandler>你会得偷窥眼的
<10-1,Chandler>You're gonna get peep-eye.

203
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,390
<10-2,Ross>我就知道  我就知道她喜欢他
<10-2,Ross>I knew it. I knew it. I always knew she liked him.

204
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,080
<10-2,Ross>她一直否认  结果呢
<10-2,Ross>She'd say no,but here we are.

205
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,710
<10-2,Ross>我们才刚分手  她就变心了
<10-2,Ross>We just broke up, first thing she does!

206
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,890
<10-4,Ross>-你们可不是"才刚"分手  -才三个星期
<10-4,Ross>- You didn't "just break up." - It's been, like, three weeks!

207
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,230
<10-5,Chandler>你跟她分手后不到三小时就跟别人上床了
<10-5,Chandler>You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.

208
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,290
<10-5,Chandler>连子弹出膛都没这么快
<10-5,Chandler>I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

209
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,030
<10-6,Ross>他们回来了  他们
<10-6,Ross>Here they come! Here they...

210
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,920
<10-6,Ross>要是她跟他吻别  我发誓我会自杀的
<10-6,Ross>If she kisses him good night, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.

211
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,540
<10-6,Ross>我看不下去了
<10-6,Ross>I can't watch.

212
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,150
<10-6,Ross>约会该结束了  该结束了
<10-6,Ross>Come on. Date over! Date over!

213
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,330
<10-6,Ross>-没事  她要进去了  -好的
<10-6,Ross>- Here we go. She's going in. - Okay.

<10-8,Ross>等等  他也要进去了
<10-8,Ross>Wait! He's going in!

216
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,040
<10-8,Ross>他进去了  门关了
<10-8,Ross>He's going in!The door's closed!

217
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,950
<10-8,Ross>门关着我什么都看不到
<10-8,Ross>I can't see anything with the door closed!

218
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,770
<10-9,Chandler>门的发明者可以安息了
<10-9,Chandler>And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.

219
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,850
<10-10,Ross>我得想个办法  我得阻止他们
<10-10,Ross>I have to do something. I have to stop it!

220
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,190
<10-11,Chandler>-阻止什么  -我不知道
<10-11,Chandler>- Stop what? - I don't know.

221
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,180
<10-12,Ross>但我觉得我到他们屋里就想明白了
<10-12,Ross>But I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it.

222

<10-14,Ross>They must be stopped!

225
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,150
<10-15,Chandler>我是你的朋友  我不会让你这么做的
<10-15,Chandler>I am your friend and I am not gonna let you do this!

226
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,320
<10-15,Chandler>你还真强壮

<10-21,Chandler>就算不是他也会有别人
<10-21,Chandler>If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

232
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,570
<10-21,Chandler>除非你打算租下这个猫眼
<10-21,Chandler>And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole...

233
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,600
<10-21,Chandler>否则你就得
<10-21,Chandler>you're gonna have to get used to

234
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,100
<10-21,Chandler>面对分手的事实
<10-21,Chandler>the fact that the relationship is over!

<11-1,Mark>咖啡杯底为什么都有编号
<11-1,Mark>Why do your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?

241
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,640
<11-2,Rachel>这样莫妮卡才方便追踪
<11-2,Rachel>Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,870
<11-2,Rachel>要是少了一个
<11-2,Rachel>That way if one of them's missing,

243
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,750
<11-2,Rachel>她就可以说  "27号杯呢"
<11-2,Rachel>she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

244
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,070
<11-4,Mark>-你知道吗  -不知道  也不想知道
<11-4,Mark>- You know what?- No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.

245

<11-6,Mark>-我办不到  -我就是不想知道这件事
<11-6,Mark>- I can't do this. - Yeah, yeah. That's what I didn't want to know.

246
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,450
<11-7,Rachel>马克  我的出发点是错的
<11-7,Rachel>Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?

247
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,050
<11-7,Rachel>我只是想报复罗斯
<11-7,Rachel>I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.

248
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,790
<11-7,Rachel>对不起  这样对你不公平
<11-7,Rachel>I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

249
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,630
<11-7,Rachel>去他的公平
<11-7,Rachel>Fair, shmair. You know?

<11-8,Mark>I say we get back at him right here on this couch. Right here!

253
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,980
<11-9,Rachel>天哪
<11-9,Rachel>Oh, my God.

254
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,700
<11-9,Rachel>很抱歉
<11-9,Rachel>I'm sorry about this.

255

<11-12,Mark>I can just go home and get back at him by myself.

258
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,710
<12-1,Spokeswoman>...它将成为21世纪的青霉素
<12-1,Spokeswoman>...and should become the penicillin of the 21st century.

259
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,580
<12-1,Spokeswoman>所以今天  本院将迈出领导改革的
<12-1,Spokeswoman>And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps...

260
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,780
<12-1,Spokeswoman>关键一步
<12-1,Spokeswoman>toward leading that revolution.

261
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,710
<12-2,Pete>问你一件事
<12-2,Pete>Can I ask you something?

262
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,570
<12-4,Pete>目前是什么状况
<12-4,Pete>Where are we?

263

<12-5,Monica>有这么多医生和护士在场
<12-5,Monica>Well, with all these doctors and nurses...

264
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,270
<12-5,Monica>应该是侏儒马术表演
<12-5,Monica>I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo."

265
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,430
<12-6,Pete>跟我说实话
<12-6,Pete>Just tell me the truth.

266
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,970
<12-6,Pete>好吧
<12-6,Pete>OK.

267
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,870
<12-7,Monica>我应该没有告诉你  但是
<12-7,Monica>You know, I don't think I told you this but...

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,340
<12-7,Monica>我刚结束一段很认真的感情
<12-7,Monica>I just recently got out of a really serious relationship.

269
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,610
<12-8,Pete>那不是都一年前的事了吗
<12-8,Pete>Oh, right. Wasn't that a year ago?

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,770
<12-9,Monica>原来我说过了
<12-9,Monica>So I did tell you.

271
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,630
<12-9,Monica>其实不是这个原因
<12-9,Monica>Okay, you know? That's not really the thing.

272
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,940
<12-9,Monica>原因是目前
<12-9,Monica>The thing is that right now

273
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,100
<12-9,Monica>我只想把注意力放在自己身上
<12-9,Monica>I'm just in a place in my life where I just need to focus on me.

274
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,210
<12-10,Pete>-你懂吗  -我懂
<12-10,Pete>- Do you know what I mean? - Oh, I know what are you mean.

275
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,810
<12-11,Monica>我也想对你有兴趣
<12-11,Monica>I so want to be attracted to you.

276
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,190
<12-12,Pete>但是你没有  好了  没事
<12-12,Pete>But you're not. Okay. Good.

277
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,170
<12-13,Monica>对不起
<12-13,Monica>I'm sorry.

278
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,840
<12-14,Pete>知道吗  不必抱歉
<12-14,Pete>You know what, don't be, it's not,

279
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,190
<12-14,Pete>不必抱歉  没有那么糟
<12-14,Pete>don't be, because it's not so bad.

280
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,890
<12-15,Monica>真的
<12-15,Monica>It's not?

281
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,630
<12-16,Pete>我又不是约翰·邦乔维(摇滚明星)
<12-16,Pete>Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

282
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,800
<12-16,Pete>或是对你有吸引力的人
<12-16,Pete>Or someone you find attractive.

283
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,450
<12-16,Pete>我只是觉得
<12-16,Pete>I just think, you know...

284
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,360
<12-16,Pete>你的感觉或许会变
<12-16,Pete>that you might end up feeling differently.

285
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,210
<12-17,Monica>你别误会  但是
<12-17,Monica>I don't want this to come out wrong but...

286
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,300
<12-17,Monica>以被拒绝的人来说
<12-17,Monica>you seem awfully confident for a guy

287
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,740
<12-17,Monica>你还真有自信
<12-17,Monica>I just told I wasn't attracted to.

288
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,820
<12-18,Pete>傻得很可爱吧
<12-18,Pete>Stupidly charming, isn't it?

289

<12-18,Pete>要不要去吃饭
<12-18,Pete>Listen, let's... You wanna get something to eat?

290
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,270
<12-18,Pete>这里太令人沮丧了
<12-18,Pete>This place is kind of depressing.

291
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,900
<12-19,Spokeswoman>我们欢迎幕后功臣
<12-19,Spokeswoman>Now the man who made all of this possible,

<13-1,Chandler>一山不容二虎
<13-1,Chandler>I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,470
<13-1,Chandler>拔枪

<13-2,Chandler>What did she do now?

298
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,460
<13-3,Joey>她不过在耶鲁大学读过戏剧系
<13-3,Joey>Just because she went to Yale drama,

299
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,230
<13-3,Joey>就自以为是有史以来最伟大的女演员
<13-3,Joey>she thinks she's like the greatest actress...since sliced bread.

300
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,780

304
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,860
<13-5,Joey>还有"我好漂亮"  "我好香"
<13-5,Joey>and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good."

<13-6,Chandler>我看有某人动了心哦
<13-6,Chandler>I think somebody has a crush on somebody.

<13-7,Joey>钱德勒  请专心讨论我的问题好吗
<13-7,Joey>Chandler can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?

<13-10,Chandler>这两天你开口闭口都是她
<13-10,Chandler>You've done nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours.

310
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,940
<13-10,Chandler>要是你还是学生
<13-10,Chandler>If you were in school,

311
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,790
<13-10,Chandler>你早就在拉她的辫子  推倒她了
<13-10,Chandler>you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.

312
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,560
<13-11,Joey>是吗  那为什么我老是想着
<13-11,Joey>Oh yeah? Then how come I keep thinking about her...

313
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,590
<13-11,Joey>跟她在各种场景中嘿咻呢
<13-11,Joey>in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?

316
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,420
<13-11,Joey>因为我实在搞不懂
<13-11,Joey>Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.

317
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,900
<13-11,Joey>我们的交谈没有感情
<13-11,Joey>I talk to you, and it's nothing.
