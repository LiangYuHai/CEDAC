<1-1,Chandler>慢着  慢着
<1-1,Chandler>Wait a minute, wait.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,110
<1-1,Chandler>你是说这个女演员
<1-1,Chandler>You're telling me this actress person...

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,070
<1-1,Chandler>是唯一一个对你的示爱毫无回应的女人吗
<1-1,Chandler>...is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,560
<1-2,Joey>是啊  天哪
<1-2,Joey>Yeah. Oh, my God.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,340
<1-2,Joey>你的人生就是这样吗
<1-2,Joey>Is this what it's like to be you?

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,220
<1-3,Monica>-你真的很喜欢她啊  -你都想象不出
<1-3,Monica>- You're crazy about her, huh? - You have no idea.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,630
<1-4,Joey>我们在台上时  我可以吻她摸她
<1-4,Joey>When we're on stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,480
<1-4,Joey>结果她却跟导演回家
<1-4,Joey>She goes home with the director...

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
<1-4,Joey>我就心如刀割
<1-4,Joey>...and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,800
<1-5,Phoebe>看你这样感觉真好
<1-5,Phoebe>Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,410
<1-10,Ross>我们都很震惊
<1-10,Ross>We were all pretty shaken up about it.

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,720
<1-11,Phoebe>我漏听了什么
<1-11,Phoebe>Am I missing something?

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,110
<1-11,Phoebe>在某种程度上  死亡不是悲伤的事吗
<1-11,Phoebe>I thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,100
<1-12,Ross>施薇亚姑姑...
<1-12,Ross>Well, Aunt Sylvia was...

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,320
<1-12,Ross>不是一个好人
<1-12,Ross>... not a nice person.

19
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,900
<1-13,Monica>她是个残忍的糟老太婆
<1-13,Monica>She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,800
<1-13,Monica>我很难过她死了
<1-13,Monica>And I'm sorry she died.

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,880
<1-13,Monica>爸爸有没有说娃娃屋归我
<1-13,Monica>Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

<1-14,Ross>-娃娃屋归你了  -我得到娃娃屋了
<1-14,Ross>- You get the dollhouse. - I get the dollhouse!

<1-16,Phoebe>我小时候只有铁桶
<1-16,Phoebe>When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

<1-17,Joey>菲比  你拿铁桶当娃娃屋吗
<1-17,Joey>Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,620
<1-18,Phoebe>不  就是一个铁桶
<1-18,Phoebe>No, just a barrel.

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,590
<1-19,Monica>你可以玩我的娃娃屋
<1-19,Monica>You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.

28
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,550

<1-21,Monica>When I was young I wanted to play with this dollhouse.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,770
<1-21,Monica>但是不行  只准看不准玩
<1-21,Monica>But no! It was to be looked at,never played with.

32
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,570
<1-22,Chandler>我奶奶以前也是这样告诫我的
<1-22,Chandler>My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.

<2-5,Rachel>You didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.

51

<2-6,Chandler>没事  不客气
<2-6,Chandler>That's okay. No problem.

52

<2-12,Rachel>乔安娜  我的朋友钱德勒·宾
<2-12,Rachel>Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing.

<2-12,Rachel>这是乔安娜
<2-12,Rachel>Joanna.

59
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,940
<2-13,Joanna>宾  很棒的姓
<2-13,Joanna>Bing? That's a great name.

60
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,940
<2-14,Chandler>那是盖尔语的"火鸡煮好了"
<2-14,Chandler>It's Gaelic for,"Thy turkey's done."

<2-17,Joanna>So what's wrong with him?

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
<2-18,Rachel>没什么  他都这样疯疯癫癫的
<2-18,Rachel>Nothing. He's just goofy like that.

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,760
<2-18,Rachel>我都没感觉了
<2-18,Rachel>I actually hardly notice it anymore.

66
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,550
<2-19,Joanna>我是说他已婚吗  有对象吗
<2-19,Joanna>I mean, is he married or involved with anyone?

<2-21,Joanna>Rachel, actually, you know what? Forget it.

<2-22,Rachel>-需要的话  我可以帮你探探口风  -真的吗
<2-22,Rachel>- I'll ask him for you, if you want. - Would you?

70
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,710
<2-23,Joanna>这样会不会太可悲  太饥渴
<2-23,Joanna>Or is it too sad and desperate,

71
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,620
<2-23,Joanna>你懂的  就像苏菲一样
<2-23,Joanna>you know, something Sophie would do?

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,140
<2-24,Sophie>-我能听见  -我知道

<3-1,Monica>你们看
<3-1,Monica>Look at it!

74
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,010
<3-1,Monica>壁纸有点褪色  没关系
<3-1,Monica>Wallpaper's a little faded. That's okay.

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,260
<3-1,Monica>地毯有点翘起来
<3-1,Monica>Carpet's a little loose.

76
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,920
<3-1,Monica>硬木地板
<3-1,Monica>Hardwood floors?!

<3-9,Monica>这是什么
<3-9,Monica>What's this?

81
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,440
<3-10,Phoebe>狗狗  每栋房子都应该有只狗
<3-10,Phoebe>That's a dog. Every house should have a dog.

82
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,940
<3-11,Monica>不能大到可以在屋顶上撒尿
<3-11,Monica>Not one that can pee on the roof.

83
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,810
<3-12,Phoebe>它这么大也许是
<3-12,Phoebe>Maybe it's so big because

84
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,780
<3-12,Phoebe>因为房子盖在辐射废料掩埋地上
<3-12,Phoebe>the house was built on radioactive waste.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
<3-13,Chandler>这是防止房子打喷嚏用的吗
<3-13,Chandler>And is this in case the house sneezes?

86
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,570
<3-14,Phoebe>不是  那是阁楼里的鬼
<3-14,Phoebe>No, that's the ghost for the attic.

87
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,400
<3-15,Monica>-我不要鬼  -谁都不想闹鬼
<3-15,Monica>- I don't want a ghost. - Well, nobody wants a ghost.

88
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,680
<3-16,Phoebe>但是这里闹鬼
<3-16,Phoebe>But you've got one...

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,860
<3-16,Phoebe>因为房子盖在印地安古坟场上
<3-16,Phoebe>... because the house is sitting on an ancient lndian burial ground.

90
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,470
<3-17,Ross>慢着  这栋房子盖在辐射废料掩埋地
<3-17,Ross>Wait a minute. The house was built on radioactive waste...

91
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,880
<3-17,Ross>和印地安古坟场上
<3-17,Ross>...and an ancient lndian burial ground?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,530
<3-17,Ross>那是不可能的
<3-17,Ross>That would never happen.

93
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,030
<3-18,Phoebe>显然你太不了解美国政府了
<3-18,Phoebe>Obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.

94
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,700
<3-20,All>-我有事找你  -好  什么事
<3-20,All>- I need to talk to you. - Sure. What's up?

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,990
<3-24,Ross>有事记得找我
<3-24,Ross>Well, if something comes up....

<3-25,Chandler>恭喜你们度过尴尬期
<3-25,Chandler>I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.

99
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,180
<3-26,Rachel>我的上司乔安娜  你一离开
<3-26,Rachel>My boss. Joanna. When you left...

100
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,630
<3-26,Rachel>她就问起你的事...
<3-26,Rachel>...she started asking questions about you....

101
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,810
<3-27,Chandler>看上眼了是吧
<3-27,Chandler>Liked what she saw?

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,200
<3-27,Chandler>喜欢我的表现  对吧
<3-27,Chandler>Dug my action, did she?

103

<3-27,Chandler>在探听小钱钱的事了吧
<3-27,Chandler>Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

104
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,760
<3-28,Rachel>听起来...
<3-28,Rachel>That was...

105
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,430
<3-28,Rachel>怪怪的
<3-28,Rachel>...surreal.

106
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,720
<3-28,Rachel>怎样  有兴趣吗
<3-28,Rachel>What do you think? Are you interested?

107
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,040
<3-29,Chandler>她还不错  蛮漂亮的  好吧
<3-29,Chandler>She seemed cool. Attractive. I'll do it.

108

<3-30,Rachel>谢谢你  钱德勒  太好了  她会爱死我
<3-30,Rachel>Thank you, Chandler. This is great. She's gonna love me.

<3-31,Phoebe>Dinosaur attack! Quick, everybody into the house!

110

<3-32,Monica>你知道吗  菲比  到此为止
<3-32,Monica>All right, Phoebe, you know what? That's it. That's it.

111
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,980
<3-32,Monica>我不要恐龙  鬼和超级大狗  好吗
<3-32,Monica>No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?

112
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,100
<3-32,Monica>他们比例不对  也不是维多利亚风格
<3-32,Monica>They're not the right size, they're not Victorian

113
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,640
<3-32,Monica>总之一点也不相衬
<3-32,Monica>and they just don't go.

<7-2,The Director>When I continue, I hope there will appear on-stage...

177
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,000
<7-2,The Director>一种神奇的东西  在戏剧界称之为...
<7-2,The Director>...this magical thing that in the theater we call...

178
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,010
<7-2,The Director>"入戏"
<7-2,The Director>...committing to the moment!

179
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,720
<7-3,Joey>他跟卡通人物一样白痴
<7-3,Joey>The guy's like a cartoon.

180
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,120
<7-3,Joey>你到底看上他哪一点
<7-3,Joey>What do you see in him, anyway?

181
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,960
<7-4,Kate>他刚好很聪明
<7-4,Kate>He happens to be brilliant.

182
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,510
<7-4,Kate>比你那位毛衣女郎好多了
<7-4,Kate>Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.

183
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,880
<7-5,Joey>我不是看上她的毛衣
<7-5,Joey>I'm not interested in her sweater.

184
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,710
<7-5,Joey>毛衣底下才重要
<7-5,Joey>It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.

185
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
<7-5,Joey>而且...
<7-5,Joey>And besides...

186
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,030
<7-5,Joey>你几时开始关心我跟谁交往
<7-5,Joey>...since when do you care who I'm with?

187
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,920
<7-6,Kate>我才不关心  怎么  你希望我关心吗
<7-6,Kate>I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?

188
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,940
<7-7,Joey>你希望我希望你关心吗
<7-7,Joey>Do you want me to want you to care?

189
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,690
<7-8,Kate>你呢

<7-10,The Director>我实在很不想说  不过我们继续排吧
<7-10,The Director>Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick up where we left off.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,610

<7-11,Joey>What do you say?

194
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,820
<7-12,Kate>我没有理由留下来
<7-12,Kate>I've got no reason to stay.

195
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,080
<7-13,The Director>停
<7-13,The Director>Stop!

196
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,280

<7-13,The Director>Stop it! You must stop!

197
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,650
<7-13,The Director>你们是烂演员
<7-13,The Director>You are bad actors!

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,760

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,390
<7-14,Kate>真不敢相信一星期后就要上台了
<7-14,Kate>I can't believe we go on in a week.

201
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,920
<7-15,Joey>没问题的
<7-15,Joey>Hey, it's gonna be all right.

202
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,470
<7-16,Lauren>既然提早收工  你想去画马克杯吗
<7-16,Lauren>Since we're getting off early, do you want to go paint mugs?

203
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:55,910
<7-17,Joey>什么
<7-17,Joey>What?

204
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,910
<7-18,Lauren>就是我昨晚说的那个地方啊
<7-18,Lauren>You know at the place I told you about last night?

<7-19,Joey>对了  那里可以画马克杯
<7-19,Joey>Yeah, with the mug-painting.

206
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,980
<7-19,Joey>我听得很用心
<7-19,Joey>I was so listening to that.

207
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,740
<7-19,Joey>但是你知道吗  我今晚想好好练戏
<7-19,Joey>But you know what? I need to kind of work on my stuff tonight.

<7-22,Lauren>-好啦  -晚安
<7-22,Lauren>-Okay. - Good night!

210

<7-24,Lauren>Are you okay?

211
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,420
<7-26,Kate>还好吧
<7-26,Kate>Yeah, I guess.

212
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,500
<7-26,Kate>这场戏怎么办
<7-26,Kate>What are we gonna do about the scene?

213
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,170
<7-27,Joey>不知道
<7-27,Joey>I don't know.

214
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,650
<7-28,Kate>也许应该再激烈一点
<7-28,Kate>Maybe if it had more heat.

215
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,740
<7-29,Joey>什么意思
<7-29,Joey>Well, how do you mean?

216
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,060
<7-30,Kate>爱德莉安在寻找留下来的理由  对吧
<7-30,Kate>Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?

217
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,970
<7-30,Kate>维克多不能只是亲她  他必须...
<7-30,Kate>Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...

218
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,740
<7-30,Kate>必须给她有力的理由
<7-30,Kate>... he's gotta give her a reason.

219
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,410
<7-31,Joey>也许他可以跟她舌吻
<7-31,Joey>Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

220
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,400
<7-32,Kate>或者...
<7-32,Kate>Or maybe...

221
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,920
<7-32,Kate>他可以捉住她  把她抱起来
<7-32,Kate>... maybe he could grab her and lift her up.

222
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,270
<7-33,Joey>然后爱德莉安用腿圈住他的腰
<7-33,Joey>Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.

223
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,160
<7-34,Kate>扯开他的衣服
<7-34,Kate>Then she could rip off his shirt

224
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,550
<7-34,Kate>亲吻他的胸部  肚子
<7-34,Kate>and kiss his chest and stomach.

225
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,920
<7-35,Joey>他可以用牙齿脱掉她的衣服
<7-35,Joey>Then he could use his teeth, his teenth to undo her dress and...

226
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,980
<7-35,Joey>然后咬她
<7-35,Joey>and bite her!

227
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,760
<7-36,Kate>在结尾的部份  他可以占有她
<7-36,Kate>Then right when the scene ends, he could take her...

228
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,490
<7-36,Kate>用他那原始的  兽性的...
<7-36,Kate>...with this raw, animal....

229
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,360
<8-1,Joey>像这样吗
<8-1,Joey>Something like that?

230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,450
<8-2,Kate>跟我想的差不多
<8-2,Kate>That's pretty much what I had in mind.

231
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,220
<9-5,Joey>现在喝酒太早了吧
<9-5,Joey>It's a little early to be drinking.

232
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,780
<9-6,Ross>我没醉  我跟凯特终于有进展了
<9-6,Ross>No, no, things finally happened with Kate.

233
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,810
<9-7,Joey>真的吗  太好了
<9-7,Joey>You're kidding? That's great.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,460
<9-8,Ross>感觉好棒
<9-8,Ross>It was so amazing.

235
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,510
<9-9,Monica>做完爱之后...
<9-9,Monica>After the lovemaking...

236
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,410
<9-10,Joey>天啊
<9-10,Joey>Oh, my.

237
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,270
<9-11,Monica>我看着她睡觉看了好久
<9-11,Monica>... I just watched her sleep for hours.

238
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,440
<9-12,Joey>就这样吸气...
<9-12,Joey>Just breathing in...

239
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,530
<9-12,Joey>吐气
<9-12,Joey>...and breathing out.

240
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,280
<9-12,Joey>我知道她在做梦  因为...
<9-12,Joey>I knew she was dreaming because...

241
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,110
<9-12,Joey>她的眼睛一直这样
<9-12,Joey>... her eyes kept going like this.

242
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,040
<9-13,Chandler>我跟你说  乔安娜完全误会了  好吗
<9-13,Chandler>I'm telling you, Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?

243
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,280
<9-13,Chandler>我只是说今晚很愉快  改天再聚
<9-13,Chandler>All I said was, "This was fun. Let's do it again sometime.

244
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,780
<9-13,Chandler>我再打给你
<9-13,Chandler>I'll give you a call."

245
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,090
<9-14,Rachel>我还想她为什么觉得你会打给她
<9-14,Rachel>I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?

246
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,090
<9-15,Chandler>约完会都要这么说
<9-15,Chandler>It's what you say at the end of a date.

247
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,920
<9-16,Rachel>你就不能说  很高兴认识你  晚安
<9-16,Rachel>You can't just say,"Nice to meet you. Good night?"

248
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,250
<9-17,Chandler>当着她的面吗
<9-17,Chandler>To her face?

249
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,720
<9-17,Chandler>约会结束了  我站在那儿
<9-17,Chandler>lt's the end of the date. I'm standing there...

250
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,240
<9-17,Chandler>我知道她在等我这句话
<9-17,Chandler>...she's waiting for me to say I'll call her...

251
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,720
<9-17,Chandler>所以我就说了  就这么脱口而出
<9-17,Chandler>...and it comes out. I can't help it.

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,150
<9-17,Chandler>我也没办法
<9-17,Chandler>It's a compulsion.

253
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,090
<9-18,Monica>别这么较真  瑞秋
<9-18,Monica>Come on, Rach,

254
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,700
<9-18,Monica>男人说要联络  也不见得会联络
<9-18,Monica>When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.

255
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,760
<9-18,Monica>你没碰到过
<9-18,Monica>This never happened to you?

256
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,120
<9-19,Rachel>他们都会打给我
<9-19,Rachel>Well, they always called.

257
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,180
<9-20,Monica>杀了我吧
<9-20,Monica>Bite me.

258
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,120
<10-1,Joanna>-他打来没有  -没有  对不起
<10-1,Joanna>- Did he call? - No, sorry.

259
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,600
<10-3,Joanna>为什么  他说要打来怎么还不打来
<10-3,Joanna>Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?

260
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,110
<10-4,Sophie>也许他被你这个美丽成功的女强人吓到了
<10-4,Sophie>Maybe he's intimidated by smart, strong, successful women.

261
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,360
<10-5,Joanna>苏菲  不要拍我的马屁了
<10-5,Joanna>Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.

262
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,560
<10-5,Joanna>他为什么还不打来  瑞秋  为什么
<10-5,Joanna>Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?

263
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,770
<10-6,Rachel>好吧  好吧
<10-6,Rachel>Okay, okay.

264
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,830
<10-6,Rachel>也许他会尴尬  因为你是我的上司
<10-6,Rachel>Maybe he feels awkward because you're my boss.

265
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,930
<10-7,Joanna>尴尬  他为什么要尴尬
<10-7,Joanna>Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

266
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,480
<10-8,Rachel>要说尴尬也该是你尴尬
<10-8,Rachel>The only person that should feel awkward is you,

267
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,950
<10-9,Joanna>你没叫他不要打给我吧
<10-9,Joanna>and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?

268
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,640
<10-11,Joanna>因为要是你不喜欢你朋友跟你上司约会
<10-11,Joanna>If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for...

269
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,340
<10-11,Joanna>我们可以想办法解决
<10-11,Joanna>...there are always ways to fix that.

270
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,240
<11-1,Rachel>打给她  现在就打给她
<11-1,Rachel>Call her. Call her now!

271
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,570
<11-2,Chandler>我满手都被纸割伤了
<11-2,Chandler>Multiple so many paper cuts.

272
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,590
<11-2,Chandler>"他为什么还不打来  瑞秋
<11-2,Chandler>"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?

273
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,120
<11-3,Rachel>"为什么  为什么  我不懂"
<11-3,Rachel>"Why,why? I don't understand!"

274
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,580
<11-3,Rachel>为什么  他明明说会打给我  这是为什么呢
<11-3,Rachel>Why? He said he would call. Why? Why?

275
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,870
<11-3,Rachel>钱德勒  我跟你说她失控了  她疯了
<11-3,Rachel>Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out! She's gone crazy!

276
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,390
<11-4,Chandler>那把电话拿来吧
<11-4,Chandler>Well, give me the phone then.

277
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
<11-5,Rachel>求你了  这不是闹着玩的
<11-5,Rachel>Come on, this isn't funny.

278
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,540
<11-5,Rachel>她觉得你不联络是我的错
<11-5,Rachel>She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her.

279
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,560
<11-5,Rachel>你一定要打给她
<11-5,Rachel>You have to call her.

280
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,560
<11-6,Chandler>总不能过了这么久才打去说
<11-6,Chandler>You can't call somebody after this long to say:

281
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,640
<11-6,Chandler>"我提醒你一下  我不喜欢你"
<11-6,Chandler>"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."

282
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,910
<11-7,Rachel>那就再带她出去一次
<11-7,Rachel>Then you'll have to take her out again.

283
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,020
<11-8,Chandler>不要  她很无聊  而且在眼角
<11-8,Chandler>No. She's really dull, and she gets this...

284
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,390
<11-8,Chandler>有一大块恶心的睫毛膏印子
<11-8,Chandler>...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye!

285
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,770
<11-8,Chandler>我不管  不管
<11-8,Chandler>I don't care! I don't care!

286
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,800
<11-9,Rachel>你再约她一次  把话说清楚
<11-9,Rachel>You'll take her out again and end it...

287
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,710
<11-9,Rachel>让她知道自己没希望
<11-9,Rachel>...in a way she knows it's atually ended.

288
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,900
<11-9,Rachel>不管有多困难  千万别说你会再联络
<11-9,Rachel>I don't care how hard it is. Don't tell her you'll call her again!

289
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,020
<11-9,Rachel>好  随你
<11-9,Rachel>All right, fine!

290
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,170
<11-10,Chandler>但只能吃午餐  不能超过一小时
<11-10,Chandler>But just an lunch date, no more than an hour.

291
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,530
<11-10,Chandler>从今以后  我自己泡马子
<11-10,Chandler>From now on, I get my own dates.

292
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,860
<11-10,Chandler>你不要再帮我牵线了
<11-10,Chandler>I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!

293
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,760
<11-11,Rachel>没问题
<11-11,Rachel>That's fine!

294
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,260
<11-12,Chandler>-我只是说说  -我知道
<11-12,Chandler>- That's just a lot of big talk. - I know.

295

<12-3,Ross>失火了  失火了
<12-3,Ross>Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

297
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,440
<13-2,Kate>我跟萝伦谈过了  跟她说了我们的事
<13-2,Kate>I talked to Lauren. I told her how things were with us.

298
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,000
<13-3,Joey>你跟马歇尔说了吗
<13-3,Joey>Did you talk to Marshall?

299
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,790
<13-4,Kate>说什么
<13-4,Kate>About what?

300
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,430
<13-5,Joey>我们之间的事啊
<13-5,Joey>About what happened with us.

301
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,590
<13-6,Kate>没有  他没有必要知道
<13-6,Kate>No, there's really no reason why he should find out.

302
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,870
<13-6,Kate>我们就别小题大作了  好吗
<13-6,Kate>So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?

303
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,040
<13-7,Joey>你在说什么
<13-7,Joey>What are you talking about?

304
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,850
<13-7,Joey>我没有小题大作
<13-7,Joey>It was a big deal.

305
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,120
<13-7,Joey>别说昨晚对你毫无意义
<13-7,Joey>You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.

306
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,810
<13-7,Joey>我人在现场  你没那么会演
<13-7,Joey>I was there. You're not that good an actress.

307
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,260
<13-8,Kate>我只是一时激情
<13-8,Kate>I was just caught up in the moment.

308
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,500
<13-8,Kate>就这么简单
<13-8,Kate>That's all it was.

309
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,590
<13-8,Kate>乔伊  抱歉让你难过
<13-8,Kate>Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but...

310
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,830
<13-8,Kate>你也曾跟别的女人上床
<13-8,Kate>... haven't you slept with a woman

311
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,280
<13-8,Kate>然后她比你更看重这段关系吧
<13-8,Kate>and it meant more to her than to you?

312
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,650
<13-12,Joey>没有
<13-12,Joey>No.

<14-1,Ross>It's okay.

317
