<6-18,Pete>什么
<6-18,Pete>What?

139
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,190
<6-19,Phoebe>我是说这个女人...是虚构的  不是吗
<6-19,Phoebe>I'm just saying, this "woman," I mean, she's fictitious, no?

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,800
<6-20,Pete>-为什么这么说  -你还是喜欢莫妮卡
<6-20,Pete>- Why would you say that? - 'Cause you're still into Monica.

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,750
<6-21,Phoebe>你谎称有了别人  好让她与你共事
<6-21,Phoebe>You said there's somebody else so she would agree to work with you,

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,770
<6-21,Phoebe>因为你觉得  如果相处久了
<6-21,Phoebe>so 'cause you figure, if you spent a lot of time together,

143
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,540
<6-21,Phoebe>也许就会产生感情
<6-21,Phoebe>maybe something might happen, and...

144

<6-22,Pete>你真行  你真行
<6-22,Pete>You're good. You're good.

145
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,890
<6-23,Phoebe>我只是直觉准  还会通灵
<6-23,Phoebe>No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

146
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,550
<6-23,Phoebe>很实在的天赋
<6-23,Phoebe>It's a substantial gift.

147
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,170
<6-24,Pete>听我说  你能答应我不要告诉她吗
<6-24,Pete>Listen. Can you promise me that you won't tell her?

148
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,360
<6-25,Phoebe>没问题  我答应你  告诉她什么

151
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,230
<6-27,Phoebe>虽然我的直觉很准  但记性很差
<6-27,Phoebe>I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

<7-1,Chandler>好吧  但这是最后一次
<7-1,Chandler>Okay, but this is the last time.

<7-6,Joey>Don't you think it's a she?

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,520
<7-6,Joey>我不知道
<7-6,Joey>I don't know.

160
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,250
<7-7,Chandler>看不出来  那个东西一下子就缩回去了
<7-7,Chandler>I can't tell. Whatever it was went back in too quickly.

161
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,530
<7-7,Chandler>我要换衣服
<7-7,Chandler>Anyway, I gotta change.

<7-12,Joey>...trying to get her back to sleep?

169
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,770
<7-13,Chandler>你以为你起来时  我没醒着吗
<7-13,Chandler>You don't think I get up when you get up?

<7-16,Joey>我需要轻松一下  好吗  我忙了一整天
<7-16,Joey>I need to relax, okay? I was working all day.

176
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,590
<7-17,Chandler>你觉得照顾我们的小鸡就不忙吗
<7-17,Chandler>And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?

177
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,180
<7-18,Joey>我不是那个意思  好吗
<7-18,Joey>That's not what I said, okay?

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,890
<7-19,Chandler>你有没有发现  自从有了小鸡
<7-19,Chandler>Did you notice that ever since we got this chick...

180
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,490
<7-19,Chandler>我们争吵的次数变多了
<7-19,Chandler>...we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?

181
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,620
<7-20,Joey>谁知道  也许我们还没准备好养小鸡
<7-20,Joey>I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.

182
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,620
<7-21,Chandler>我明天送她回去

<7-25,Ross>What do you think? This blue suit or this brown one?

186
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,790
<7-26,Joey>棕色可以突显你的眼睛
<7-26,Joey>The brown one brings out your eyes.

187
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,310
<7-26,Joey>但蓝色那套  显得你的屁股很翘
<7-26,Joey>But your butt looks great in the blue one.

188
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,010
<7-27,Ross>真的吗
