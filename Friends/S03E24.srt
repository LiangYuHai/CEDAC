00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,830
<15-9,Monica>我告诉你一个故事
<15-9,Monica>Let me tell you a story.

232
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,170
<15-10,Pete>我着手研发的摩斯865
<15-10,Pete>When I set out to create MOSS 865,

233
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,060
<15-10,Pete>你以为是一夕成功吗
<15-10,Pete>do you think it happened overnight?

234
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,670
<15-10,Pete>不是  摩斯一代烧毁我爸的车库
<15-10,Pete>No. There was MOSS 1 that burned down my dad's garage.

235
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,620
<15-10,Pete>摩斯二代只能排一月的行程表
<15-10,Pete>There was MOSS 2 that would only schedule appointments in January.

236
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,640
<15-10,Pete>此外还有862次的失败经验
<15-10,Pete>And 862 others that I learned from.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,270
<15-10,Pete>就像我从这场比赛学到
<15-10,Pete>Just like I learned from this fight,

238
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,660
<15-10,Pete>绝不能让对手踩我的脖子
<15-10,Pete>never to let a guy stand on my neck.

239
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,520
<15-11,Monica>你之前不知道的吗
<15-11,Monica>You didn't know that already?

240
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,310
<15-12,Pete>听着  我会越来越强
<15-12,Pete>Look, I'm gonna get better.

241
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,130
<15-12,Pete>好吗  我保证
<15-12,Pete>Okay? I promise you.

242
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,260
<15-13,Monica>要强很多
<15-13,Monica>Just get a lot better.

243
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,790
<15-13,Monica>而且还要快
<15-13,Monica>Fast.

244
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,710
<15-14,Pete>还有一件事
<15-14,Pete>One other thing.

245
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,960
<15-14,Pete>保志认为你在场边  会影响我的注意力
<15-14,Pete>Hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration.

246
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,660
<15-15,Monica>对  这才是问题所在
<15-15,Monica>Yeah. That was the problem.

247
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,050
<16-2,Ross>-彼特的比赛几点开始  -还有五分钟
<16-2,Ross>- How long until Pete's fight? - About five minutes.

248
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,130
<16-3,Monica>现在他们在访问他的对手
<16-3,Monica>Right now they're interviewing his opponent.

249
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,900
<16-3,Monica>显然  他的训练方式是去伊朗拔断小偷的手臂
<16-3,Monica>Apparently, he trains by going to lran and pulling the arms off thieves.

250
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,640
<16-4,Ross>-来根热狗  -四根
<16-4,Ross>- Hot dog? - Four, please.

251
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,740
<16-5,Monica>我很紧张
<16-5,Monica>I'm really nervous.

252
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,960
<16-5,Monica>谢谢
<16-5,Monica>Thank you.

253
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,660
<16-6,Phoebe>你跟邦妮怎么样
<16-6,Phoebe>So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?

254
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,390
<16-7,Ross>我跟你说  我本没想到我会喜欢她
<16-7,Ross>What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all,

255
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,410
<16-7,Ross>我目前根本没打算要喜欢别人
<16-7,Ross>I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.

256
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,840
<16-7,Ross>但她真的很棒
<16-7,Ross>But she's really terrific.

257
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,710
<16-8,Phoebe>真糟糕
<16-8,Phoebe>It's too bad.

258
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,370
<16-9,Ross>不  我是说我喜欢她
<16-9,Ross>No, I'm saying I liked her.

259
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,830
<16-10,Phoebe>天涯何处无芳草  何必单恋一枝花
<16-10,Phoebe>Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.

260
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,300
<16-11,Ross>菲比  我觉得她很棒  我们要再见面
<16-11,Ross>Pheebs, I think she's great,okay? We're going out again.

261
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,850
<16-12,Phoebe>我听到了
<16-12,Phoebe>Okay, I hear you!

262
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,330
<16-12,Phoebe>你难道就不可以谈点别的吗
<16-12,Phoebe>Are you capable of talking about anything else?

263
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,110
<16-13,Chandler>我的火鸡汉堡在哪里
<16-13,Chandler>Which one's my turkey burger?

264
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,320
<16-14,Ross>-在我脚边...  -抱歉
<16-14,Ross>- The one next to my foot. - Sorry.

265
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,560
<16-15,Joey>-比赛开始了  -马上进去
<16-15,Joey>- Fight's starting!  - Yeah, We'll be right in.

266
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,610
<16-16,Ross>你的上司今天又打你屁股了吗
<16-16,Ross>So did your boss try to slap you again today?

267
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,100
<16-17,Chandler>九次
<16-17,Chandler>Nine times.

268
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,010
<16-17,Chandler>知道吗  害我得擦润肤乳液
<16-17,Chandler>Okay? I had to put on lotion.

269
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,930
<16-17,Chandler>不过没关系  我明天要做个实验
<16-17,Chandler>But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment,

270
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,740
<16-17,Chandler>要是顺利  我的屁股就得救了
<16-17,Chandler>And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.

271
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,130
<16-18,Joey>比赛结束
<16-18,Joey>Fight's over!

272
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,860
<17-1,Chandler>打扰一下  道格
<17-1,Chandler>Excuse me, Doug?

273
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,910
<17-1,Chandler>喂  超级运动迷
<17-1,Chandler>Hey there, sports fan!

274
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,050
<17-2,Doug>宾  数据做好了吗
<17-2,Doug>Bing! You got those numbers for me?

275
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,430
<17-3,Chandler>没有  我没做
<17-3,Chandler>No. I didn't do them.

276
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,520
<17-4,Doug>你忘了
<17-4,Doug>You forgot?

277
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,080
<17-3,Chandler>不是  我就是没做
<17-3,Chandler>No, I just didn't do them.

278
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,760
<17-5,Chandler>相反我跟朋友出去玩  喝了两杯
<17-5,Chandler>Instead, I hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.

279
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,610
<17-5,Chandler>所以我不值得表扬  不管是言语上...
<17-5,Chandler>So I certainly don't deserve praise. Verbal...

280
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,320
<17-5,Chandler>或其他方式
<17-5,Chandler>...or otherwise.

281
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,300
<17-6,Doug>我昨晚也醉了
<17-6,Doug>I got tanked myself last night.

282
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,680
<17-6,Doug>开车回家路上真惊险
<17-6,Doug>Pretty dicey drive home.

283
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,050
<17-6,Doug>塔本吉桥从没这么狭窄过
<17-6,Doug>Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

284
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,670
<17-6,Doug>没关系  你还是我的头号爱将  宾
<17-6,Doug>That's okay. You're still my number-one guy! Bing!

285
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,690
<17-7,Chandler>道格
<17-7,Chandler>Doug!

286
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,960
<17-9,Chandler>我对你的表达方式有点不习惯
<17-9,Chandler>I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.

287
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,850
<17-10,Doug>是脏话吗  你听不惯我经常骂脏话吗
<17-10,Doug>Is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing?

288
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,940
<17-10,Doug>如果是的话  那你可以去吃屎了
<17-10,Doug>Because I gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!

289
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,600
<17-11,Chandler>不是骂脏话的事
<17-11,Chandler>No, no. It's not about the swearing.

290
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,060
<17-11,Chandler>而是...
<17-11,Chandler>It's more about the way...

291
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,190
<17-11,Chandler>你偶尔会把你的热情...
<17-11,Chandler>that you occasionally concentrate...

292
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,760
<17-11,Chandler>集中在...
<17-11,Chandler>your enthusiasm...

293
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,510
<17-12,Doug>我的屁股上
<17-12,Doug>on my buttocks.

294
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,580
<17-13,Chandler>别误会  我很感激你的用心良苦
<17-13,Chandler>Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the sentiment.

295
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,170
<17-13,Chandler>只不过我的臀部...很敏感
<17-13,Chandler>It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.

296
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,290
<17-13,Chandler>而且这会让别人嫉妒
<17-13,Chandler>And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,780
<17-14,Doug>别再说了  你能开口确实很有勇气
<17-14,Doug>Well, say no more. You know, it takes guts to bring this up.

298
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,420
<17-14,Doug>宾  你不会挨打了
<17-14,Doug>Bing, you're okay.

299
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,040
<18-1,Phoebe>你宁可住在满身大汗的巨人的上衣口袋
<18-1,Phoebe>Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...

300
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,940
<18-1,Phoebe>还是他的排水管里
<18-1,Phoebe>...or inside his shower drain?

301
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,090
<18-1,Phoebe>天啊
<18-1,Phoebe>Oh, my God.

302
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,660
<18-1,Phoebe>菲比  你看  是罗斯和那个女的
<18-1,Phoebe>Phoebe. Look. It's Ross and that girl.

303
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,490
<19-1,Phoebe>不不  你看这里
<19-1,Phoebe>No, no, no.  Look at that!

304
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,330
<19-1,Phoebe>-有一排蚂蚁  他们在同心协力  -菲比
<19-1,Phoebe>- It's a line of ants! They're working as a team! - Phoebe!

305
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,580
<19-3,Phoebe>是他们没错
<19-3,Phoebe>Right. Oh, yeah.

306
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,570
<19-3,Phoebe>罗斯好像要跟她分手了
<19-3,Phoebe>It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.

307
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,540
<19-3,Phoebe>-希望他不要太狠  -菲比  你看清楚
<19-3,Phoebe>- I hope he lets her down easy. - Come on, Phoebe! Look at that!

308
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,560
<19-4,Rachel>他们没有要分手  好好看看
<19-4,Rachel>They are not breaking up! Look at them! Okay?

309
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,050
<19-4,Rachel>够了  这只是第二次的约会  就已经这样
<19-4,Rachel>Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is!

310
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,610
<19-4,Rachel>你看  她把手放到他的大腿上
<19-4,Rachel>Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...

311
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,790
<19-5,Phoebe>没事啦  小意思
<19-5,Phoebe>Oh no! That really is nothing.

312
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,550
<19-5,Phoebe>-她在性方面很主动  -天啊
<19-5,Phoebe>- She's very sexually aggressive. - Oh, God!

313
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,230
<19-6,Rachel>菲比  都是你不好
<19-6,Rachel>Phoebe, it's your fault.

314
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,910
<19-6,Rachel>现在他爱上她了  他就会娶她
<19-6,Rachel>Now he loves her. He'll marry her.

315
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,690
<19-6,Rachel>都是你的错
<19-6,Rachel>and this is all your fault.

316
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,100
<19-7,Phoebe>你自己说没关系
<19-7,Phoebe>You said it was okay.

317
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,540
<19-8,Rachel>你说她是光头
<19-8,Rachel>You said she was bald!

318
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,550
<19-9,Phoebe>以前  我说了是以前  以前...
<19-9,Phoebe>Was! Was, was, was!

319
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,490
<19-10,Rachel>菲比  我们不能放任他们发展
<19-10,Rachel>Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen!

320
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,550
<19-10,Rachel>我们得想个办法  我们得拆散他们
<19-10,Rachel>Okay, we have to dosomething! We have to break them up! Okay?

321
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,740
<19-10,Rachel>快冲进去把她头发剃了
<19-10,Rachel>Just go in there and like, shave her head!

322
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,990
<19-10,Rachel>你欠我一个光头女
<19-10,Rachel>You owe me one bald girl!!

323
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,000
<19-11,Phoebe>首先  深呼吸
<19-11,Phoebe>Okay, first of all, breathe.

324
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,410
<19-11,Phoebe>其次  我实在不懂
<19-11,Phoebe>Second of all, I don't get it.

325
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,550
<19-11,Phoebe>不是你决定要跟罗斯分手的吗
<19-11,Phoebe>Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?

326
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,870
<19-12,Rachel>是
<19-12,Rachel>Yes.

327
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,760
<19-13,Phoebe>他不是你的朋友吗
<19-13,Phoebe>Well, isn't he your friend?

328
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,190
<19-13,Phoebe>你不希望他快乐吗
<19-13,Phoebe>Don't you want him to be happy?

329
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,700
<19-15,Phoebe>-希望  -所以
<19-15,Phoebe>- Yes. - So?

330
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,630
<19-16,Rachel>只是  我没想到他会这么快找到幸福
<19-16,Rachel>It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.

331
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,930
<19-17,Phoebe>-完了  -怎样
<19-17,Phoebe>- Oh, no. - What?

332
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,530
<19-19,Phoebe>蚁群被我们全弄死了
<19-19,Phoebe>We killed them all!

333
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,860
<20-1,Pete>没事的  没这么严重  这是预防措施
<20-1,Pete>It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution.

334
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,410
<20-1,Pete>我的脊椎骨不能动
<20-1,Pete>I'm not supposed to move my spine.

335
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,440
<20-2,Monica>拜托告诉我你要放弃了
<20-2,Monica>Please tell me you're stopping now.

336
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,380
<20-3,Pete>我没事  今晚要我上场都行
<20-3,Pete>I'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they'd let me.

337
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,490
<20-3,Pete>你看我划出的这个圆了吗
<20-3,Pete>Now, see this circle I'm marking off here?

338
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,930
<20-3,Pete>这是我的"恐怖区"
<20-3,Pete>This is my Zone of Terror.

339
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,070
<20-4,Monica>你疯了  你一定要放弃
<20-4,Monica>You are insane! You've got to give this up!

340
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,020
<20-4,Monica>除非我拿到终极格斗冠军  不然没门
<20-4,Monica>I can't until I'm the Ultimate Fighter.

341
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,320
<20-5,Pete>我会成功的
<20-5,Pete>I will do it.

342
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,430
<20-5,Pete>我跟你说  总有一天
<20-5,Pete>I'm telling you. The day will come

343
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,140
<20-5,Pete>小朋友会争辩我和超人...
<20-5,Pete>when children will argue over who will win a fight...

344
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,470
<20-5,Pete>谁会打赢
<20-5,Pete>...me or Superman.

345
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,820
<20-5,Pete>我当然赢不过超人  不过小孩子都很笨
<20-5,Pete>Not that I could beat Superman, but kids are stupid.

346
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,250
<20-6,Monica>你先坐下
<20-6,Monica>Just sit down.

347
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,690
<20-6,Monica>听我说
<20-6,Monica>Please listen to me.

348
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,620
<20-6,Monica>你打得很烂
<20-6,Monica>You are terrible at this,okay?

349
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,750
<20-6,Monica>你是史上最烂的终极格斗手
<20-6,Monica>You are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

350
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,270
<20-6,Monica>最烂的
<20-6,Monica>Ever!

351
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,940
<20-7,Pete>我的肌腱套破裂  右前臂有轻微骨折
<20-7,Pete>I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm...

352
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,530
<20-7,Pete>喉结严重瘀伤  但都没你话来得伤人
<20-7,Pete>...and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.

353
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,130
<20-7,Pete>那么  你知道吗
<20-7,Pete>Well, then, you know what?

354
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,670
<20-8,Monica>我太爱你  没办法看你这样伤害自己
<20-8,Monica>I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.

355
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,400
<20-8,Monica>要是你非打不可  我就不奉陪了
<20-8,Monica>So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.

356
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,620
<20-9,Pete>如果你要我放弃
<20-9,Pete>If you're asking me to quit...

357
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,230
<20-9,Pete>就是要我违背本性
<20-9,Pete>...then you're asking me to be someone I'm not.

358
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,270
<20-9,Pete>我非打不可
<20-9,Pete>I've got to do this.

359
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,590
<20-10,Monica>那我要走了
<20-10,Monica>Then I've gotta go.

360
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,420
<20-10,Monica>再见
<20-10,Monica>Bye.

361
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,130
<20-12,Monica>-莫妮卡  -怎么
<20-12,Monica>-Monica. - Yes.

362
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,170
<20-13,Pete>你可以留张字条吗  我服了大量止痛药
<20-13,Pete>Could you leave a note? I'm on a lot of painkillers now...

363
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,670
<20-13,Pete>我怕明天会不记得这件事
<20-13,Pete>and I don't know ifI'll remember this tomorrow.

364
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,600
<21-1,Doug>总而言之  节节上升  我很满意
<21-1,Doug>So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy.

365
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,910
<21-1,Doug>大伙干得好  明天八点半见
<21-1,Doug>Great job, team! Tomorrow at 8:30.

366
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,710
<21-1,Doug>菲尔  干得好  史蒂芬  漂亮
<21-1,Doug>Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

367
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,420
<21-1,Doug>戈博  你这个疯子
<21-1,Doug>Goldberg, you maniac!

368
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,700
<21-1,Doug>我爱你
<21-1,Doug>I love you!

369

<21-1,Doug>-宾  没有你可不行  -谢谢  先生
<21-1,Doug>- Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya. - Thank you, sir.

370
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,300
<21-3,Stevens>抱歉
<21-3,Stevens>Oh, excuse me.

371
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,590
<21-3,Stevens>我忘了拿公事包  这是意外
<21-3,Stevens>I forgot my briefcase ,you know, by accident.

372
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,790
<21-4,Doug>当然是意外  你还忘了一件事  混小子
<21-4,Doug>Of course, you did. Forgot something else too, you bastard!

373
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,020
<21-4,Doug>你呢
<21-4,Doug>Well, what about you?

374
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,470
<21-4,Doug>不会觉得被冷落了吧
<21-4,Doug>You're not feeling left out, are you?

375
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,640
<21-5,Chandler>一点也不会  开什么玩笑
<21-5,Chandler>No, no, not at all. That's ridiculous.

376
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,610
<21-6,Doug>大家都有  你也想来一下  对吧
<21-6,Doug>Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?

377
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,160
<21-7,Chandler>没错
<21-7,Chandler>Yes, yes, I do.

378
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,100
<21-8,Doug>给我滚吧
<21-8,Doug>Now, get on out of here, you!

379
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,100
<22-1,TV Announcer>彼特·贝克绕着格斗场
<22-1,TV Announcer>Pete Becker circles the ring now.

380
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,210
<22-1,TV Announcer>似乎想弄清楚自己的情势
<22-1,TV Announcer>Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.

381
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,290
<22-1,TV Announcer>-"魁梧男"进攻了  -逃啊
<22-1,TV Announcer>- Bruiser is charging! - Run!

382
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,400
<22-2,Chandler>快逃啊  死变态有钱人
<22-2,Chandler>Run, you crazy, rich freak!

383
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,250
<22-3,Rachel>我不敢看
<22-3,Rachel>No, I can't watch this.

384
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,130
<22-4,Joey>你看  他要赢了  彼特要赢了
<22-4,Joey>Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!

385
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,110
<22-6,Joey>-真的吗  -假的
<22-6,Joey>- Really - No!

386
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,710
<22-7,TV Announcer>"魁梧男"把贝克打倒在地
<22-7,TV Announcer>Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas

387
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,880
<22-7,TV Announcer>向他最喜欢的部位进攻
<22-7,TV Announcer>and is going for his favorite area!

388
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,380
<22-9,Phoebe>既然是最喜欢的部位  为何要下这种毒手
<22-9,Phoebe>Wait! If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?

389
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,950
<22-10,Ross>真是讽刺
<22-10,Ross>This is ironic.

390
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,920
<22-10,Ross>你的前任男友理查德不想生小孩
<22-10,Ross>Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.

391
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,960
<22-10,Ross>按现在来看  彼特是不能生了
<22-10,Ross>And from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
