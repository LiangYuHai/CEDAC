110
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,590
<7-4,Joey>他说他要赶你们走  回见
<7-4,Joey>Instead, he'll evict you. see you later!

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,060

<11-12,Rachel>就这样
<11-12,Rachel>Well, that's it.

185
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,030
<11-13,Chandler>我们毁了
<11-13,Chandler>We're doomed.

186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,460
<11-13,Chandler>我们下半辈子
<11-13,Chandler>They'll take $50 a month from our

187
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,790
<11-13,Chandler>每个月都会白白扣掉50元
<11-13,Chandler>accounts for the rest of our lives.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,060
<11-13,Chandler>我们该怎么办
<11-13,Chandler>What are we gonna do?

189
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,970
<11-14,Monica>你们可以真的去健身
<11-14,Monica>You could actually go to the gym.

190
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,780
<11-15,Ross>或者去银行
<11-15,Ross>Or we could go to the bank...

191
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,880
<11-15,Ross>取消户头  断了他们的财路
<11-15,Ross>...close our accounts and cut them off at the source.

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,950
<11-16,Chandler>你太有才了
<11-16,Chandler>You're a genius.

193
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,460
<11-17,Joey>那我们就不能当银行好兄弟了
<11-17,Joey>Oh, man! but then, we won't be bank buddies.

194
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,830
<11-18,Chandler>现在又多了一个理由
<11-18,Chandler>Now there's two reasons.

195
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,470
<11-20,All>记得我说的那个帅哥客人
<11-20,All>You guys, remember that cute client i told you about?

196
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,800
<11-21,Phoebe>我咬了他
<11-21,Phoebe>I bit him.

197

<11-23,Phoebe>-咬哪里  -屁屁
<11-23,Phoebe>-where? -on the tushy.

198
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,210
<11-24,Ross>这样就不违反你的誓约
<11-24,Ross>And that's not against your oath?

199
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,880
<11-25,Phoebe>我知道  对不起  但是一摸到他
<11-25,Phoebe>I know, but the moment i touch him...

200
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,130
<11-25,Phoebe>我就想抛开旧誓约
<11-25,Phoebe>...i want to throw out my old

201
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,320
<11-25,Phoebe>来一个非限制级的
<11-25,Phoebe>and take a new, dirty one.

202
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,220
<11-26,Monica>下次你再按摩的时候  就让自己分心
<11-26,Monica>Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.

203
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,930
<11-27,Joey>对  像我如果在做很兴奋的事
<11-27,Joey>Like when i'm doing something exciting...

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,060
<11-27,Joey>又不想太
<11-27,Joey>...and i don't want to get too...

205
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,770
<11-27,Joey>兴奋
<11-27,Joey>...excited.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,800
<11-27,Joey>我就会想别的事  像三明治
<11-27,Joey>I try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches,

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,840
<11-27,Joey>棒球

<12-2,MrTreeger>跟着我的舞步
<12-2,MrTreeger>...just follow my lead.

213
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,360
<12-3,Joey>不必先做点准备
<12-3,Joey>Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?

214
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,760
<12-3,Joey>像是喝个烂醉
<12-3,Joey>Like get really drunk?

215
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,630
<12-4,MrTreeger>来  抱着我
<12-4,MrTreeger>Come on. hey, just put your arms around me.

216
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,810
<2-12,Rachel>对不起
<2-12,Rachel>I'm sorry.

217
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,080
<12-5,MrTreeger>没关系  如果我是玛姬
<12-5,MrTreeger>No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge,

218
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,280
<12-6,Joey>我的胸会被撞到背后去
<12-6,Joey>...my breasts are coming out my back.

219
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,260
<12-7,MrTreeger>算了  我根本不会跳舞
<12-7,MrTreeger>Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this,

220
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,850
<12-7,MrTreeger>我妈说得对
<12-7,MrTreeger>My mom was right.

221
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,330
<12-7,MrTreeger>我只是穿了衣服的大猪公
<12-7,MrTreeger>I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.

222
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,060
<12-8,Joey>别这样  你不是猪公
<12-8,Joey>Come on man, you're not a potato.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,670
<12-9,MrTreeger>总之我不适合跳舞
<12-9,MrTreeger>I'm sure as hell a dancer,it's no use

224
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,430
<12-9,MrTreeger>玛姬不会看上我的
<12-9,MrTreeger>Marge will never go for me.

225
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,100
<12-10,Joey>别这么说  你只是
<12-10,Joey>Come on, treeger. don't say that.

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,140
<12-10,Joey>只是需要练习
<12-10,Joey>You just need more practice.

227

<12-10,Joey>来  再试一次
<12-10,Joey>Come on. let's try it again.

228
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,550
<12-10,Joey>而且就算有问题  也八成在我身上
<12-10,Joey>Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,350
<12-10,Joey>我不太习惯跟一个
<12-10,Joey>I'm not that comfortable dancing with a

<13-1,Monica>舞练得怎样  有同志情谊了
<13-1,Monica>So how goes the dancing? gay yet?

231
