1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,290
<1-1,Chandler>我刚撞见凯西光着身体
<1-1,Chandler>I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked!

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,320
<1-1,Chandler>真是酷刑
<1-1,Chandler>It was like torture.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,990
<1-2,Ross>要是你去打仗被俘  你就有福了
<1-2,Ross>Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured,you're in for a big surprise.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,460
<1-3,Chandler>事情越来越糟
<1-3,Chandler>It keeps getting worse and worse.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,350
<1-3,Chandler>爱上室友的女朋友已经够糟了
<1-3,Chandler>Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,000
<1-3,Chandler>而且我觉得她知道
<1-3,Chandler>which by the way, I think she knows.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,770
<1-3,Chandler>每次我们共处一室
<1-3,Chandler>Because Every time we're in the same room together,

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,140
<1-3,Chandler>气氛就很诡异紧张
<1-3,Chandler>there's weird energy between us.

9
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,080
<1-3,Chandler>就当我疯了  但我觉得她也喜欢我
<1-3,Chandler>Call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,550
<1-3,Chandler>现在我又看到她的裸体
<1-3,Chandler>And now I have seen her naked.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,410
<1-3,Chandler>她穿着衣服
<1-3,Chandler>At least with her clothes on

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,020
<1-3,Chandler>我还能想像她全身长满烂疮
<1-3,Chandler>I could imagine her body was covered in boils.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,690
<1-3,Chandler>结果没有  她很光滑
<1-3,Chandler>But there are no boils. She's smooth.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,230
<1-3,Chandler>很光滑
<1-3,Chandler>Smooth!

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,790
<1-4,Phoebe>-大家看到他的长袍走光了吗  -上帝啊
<1-4,Phoebe>Wow! Everyone totally see up his robe?  Oh, my God!

31

<2-2,Joey>-拿去  -我待会打给你  好
<2-2,Joey>-Here you go. -Great. All right. I'll call you later.

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,950
<2-3,Casey>好的
<2-3,Casey>Great!

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,590
<2-4,Chandler>那是谁
<2-4,Chandler>Hey, hey. Who was that?

34
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,090
<2-5,Joey>那是凯希  我们晚上要约会
<2-5,Joey>That would be Casey.  We're going out tonight.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,890
<2-5,Joey>约会
<2-5,Joey>Going out? Wow!

36
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,430
<2-6,Chandler>你跟凯西分手了  真可惜
<2-6,Chandler>So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,970
<2-7,Joey>没有啊  我们很好
<2-7,Joey>No, things are fine.

38
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,670
<2-7,Joey>我跟她吃饭之前要先跟凯希吃
<2-7,Joey>I'm having a late meal with her after an early one with Casey. after an early

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,200
<2-8,Chandler>什么
<2-8,Chandler>-what? -yeah.

40
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,300
<2-9,Joey>最疯狂的是我刚吃完一整个披萨
<2-9,Joey>The craziest thing is, i just ate a whole pizza myself.

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,210
<2-10,Chandler>慢着  你要跟凯西见面
<2-10,Chandler>You're going out with kathy!

42
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,120
<2-11,Joey>对  你干嘛这么不安
<2-11,Joey>Yeah. why are you upset?

43
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,760
<2-12,Chandler>我是
<2-12,Chandler>Well, i'm upset...

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,080
<2-12,Chandler>为了你
<2-12,Chandler>...for you.

45
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,990
<2-12,Chandler>不断跟美女追求性爱
<2-12,Chandler>Sex with an endless line of beautiful

46
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,690
<2-12,Chandler>一定很空虚
<2-12,Chandler>women must be unfulfilling.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,530
<2-13,Joey>那又怎样  我们又不是唯一的
<2-13,Joey>What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.

48
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,170
<2-14,Chandler>乔伊
<2-14,Chandler>Look, Joey.

49
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,740
<2-14,Chandler>凯西显然无法满足你的心灵
<2-14,Chandler>Kathy's not fulfilling your emotional needs.

50
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,170
<2-14,Chandler>但是凯希
<2-14,Chandler>But, Casey

52
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,080
<2-14,Chandler>但是我感觉得到她聪明风趣
<2-14,Chandler>But I got this sense that she's smart and funny

<2-15,Joey>You got all that from the back of her head?

55
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,680

<11-7,Chandler>你们想他有可能谅解吗
<11-7,Chandler>Is there any way you think he will understand this?

241
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,730
<11-8,Monica>你显然没有背叛过朋友
<11-8,Monica>You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,810
<11-8,Monica>我们都很感激
<11-8,Monica>Which we all appreciate.

243
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,650
<11-9,Ross>要是你先坦承你的感觉再亲她
<11-9,Ross>If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her

244
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,420
<11-9,Ross>乔伊一定会退让
<11-9,Ross>knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.

245
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,620
<11-10,Chandler>别这么说  这不是真的吧
<11-10,Chandler>Don't say that! That's not true, is it?
