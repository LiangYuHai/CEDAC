00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,170
<5-3,Joanna>你说资料夹上黏的彩色标签吗
<5-3,Joanna>You mean those-those little colored labels you put on allthe folders?

126
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,270
<5-3,Joanna>那的确是让档案柜生色不少
<5-3,Joanna>It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.

127
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,430
<5-4,Rachel>标签的功能不只是那样而已
<5-4,Rachel>Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.

128
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,710
<5-5,Mrs. Lynch>我看到你肩负了许多重要职责
<5-5,Mrs. Lynch>I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.

129
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,280
<5-6,Rachel>对  乔安娜确实是对我有知遇之恩
<5-6,Rachel>Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.

00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,560
<5-7,Joanna>瑞秋确实做得非常不错
<5-7,Joanna>in getting my morning bagel for me.

132
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,450
<5-7,Joanna>更惊人的是  她每次都不会买错
<5-7,Joanna>It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!

133
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,960
<5-8,Rachel>我的职责当然不止那样
<5-8,Rachel>Of course, I have more responsibilities than that.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,000
<5-9,Joanna>没错  还有买咖啡
<5-9,Joanna>Of course! There's the coffee too.

135
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,660
<5-9,Joanna>瑞秋一次能拎两样东西
<5-9,Joanna>Rachel can carry two things at once.

136
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,210
<5-9,Joanna>这很好啊
<5-9,Joanna>That's very good.

137
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,070
<5-10,Mr. Posner>这项工作的一大重点是
<5-10,Mr. Posner>Now a big part of this job is

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,510
<5-10,Mr. Posner>打好私人关系  尤其是和设计师
<5-10,Mr. Posner>cultivating personalrelationships, especially with designers.

139
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,180
<5-11,Rachel>-对  我知道... -这一点瑞秋没问题
<5-11,Rachel>- Yes, I realize that... - And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that.

140
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,840
<5-12,Joanna>只怕她打得太火热  你懂的我的意思吧
<5-12,Joanna>The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.

141
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,980
<5-13,Rachel>我最爱和设计师共事了
<5-13,Rachel>I love working with designers.

142
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,160
<5-14,Joanna>共事或共枕又有何差别呢  瑞秋
<5-14,Joanna>With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach

<6-5,Monica>报社付我钱  可不是要我广结善缘的
<6-5,Monica>They don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.

152

<6-6,Phoebe>我得走了  我找到一个可以修咱们货车的人
<6-6,Phoebe>Ooh, I gotta go I found a guy who'd fix up the van for catering.

153

<13-12,Mrs. Lynch>只盼当初  她晚个几秒钟过街就没事了
<13-12,Mrs. Lynch>Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.

<14-1,Allesandro>Although I do feel bad about having fired Chef Emilio.

384
