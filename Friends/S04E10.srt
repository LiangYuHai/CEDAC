67
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,420
<2-17,Monica>他们在我帽子上写了这个

<2-18,Phoebe>Maybe they meant to write "Quiet, Bitch. "

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,470
<2-18,Phoebe>怎么了
<2-18,Phoebe>What's the matter?

<2-20,Monica>我幼稚园毕业后  就没受过这种气
<2-20,Monica>I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.

73
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,190
<2-20,Monica>当时他们找了个高中生  来跟我玩翘翘板
<2-20,Monica>And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,260

<2-23,Rachel>yell at them. or fire them!

79

<2-24,Monica>我也很想这样  但我最不会处理冲突场面
<2-24,Monica>I would love to, but I can't. I'm not good at confrontation.

80
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,380

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,620
<2-25,Chandler>都会刻意花钱请一个人  当大家面开开除他
<2-25,Chandler>who, at the beginning, would hire somebody just to fire them infront of everybody.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,550
<2-25,Chandler>好让他们知道谁说了算
<2-25,Chandler>Then they would all know who was boss.

83
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,060
<2-26,Joey>我反正没事  你干脆开除我算了

<5-5,Ross>波启浦夕那个女孩虽然住得远
<5-5,Ross>The one from Poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty

168
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,360
<5-5,Ross>但漂亮  聪明又有趣
<5-5,Ross>really smart and a lot of fun.

169

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,400
<5-5,Ross>应该也蛮聪明的  但是无趣得要命
<5-5,Ross>I guess she's smart. She's not fun.

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,150
<5-6,Phoebe>那你为什么还要跟她约会
<5-6,Phoebe>If she's no fun, why date her at all?

<5-7,Ross>若她在开玩笑就好笑到不行
<5-7,Ross>if she was kidding, was very funny.

176
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,560
<5-7,Ross>否则她不仅无聊  愚蠢  又有种族歧视
<5-7,Ross>If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and racist.
