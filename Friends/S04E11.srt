<1-6,Frank>Let's get married! Right?

14
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,940
<1-7,Phoebe>我还不知道自己有个弟弟
<1-7,Phoebe>A year ago, I didn't know I had a brother.

15
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,870
<1-7,Phoebe>结果现在又多了个弟妹

<1-7,Phoebe>我得送你们新婚礼物才行
<1-7,Phoebe>So, what...I'll get you a gift now.

21
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,200
<1-7,Phoebe>你们需要什么吗
<1-7,Phoebe>Is there anything you need?

22
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,820
<1-9,Alice>我们订婚后
<1-9,Alice>We've been trying to get pregnant

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,580
<1-9,Alice>我就一直想怀上宝宝
<1-9,Alice>pretty much ever since we got engaged,

24
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,710
<1-9,Alice>心想越早生越好
<1-9,Alice>to get a jump on things.

25
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,710
<1-9,Alice>毕竟已经青春不再了嘛
<1-9,Alice>You know, no one's getting any younger.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,720
<1-10,Frank>可问题是  我总也怀不上
<1-10,Frank>Because the thing is, we're not able to, you know, conceive.

27
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,200
<1-11,Alice>我们把该试的都试遍了
<1-11,Alice>And we've tried everything,

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,160
<1-11,Alice>也咨询过了很多医生
<1-11,Alice>We've seen a bunch of doctors.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,490
<1-12,Frank>对  他们说我们若想生小孩
<1-12,Frank>Yeah, and they say that our only chance to have a baby...

30
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,140
<1-12,Frank>唯有把我的精子和她的卵子
<1-12,Frank>is that if they take my sperm, her egg,

31
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,830
<1-12,Frank>放进培养皿里头
<1-12,Frank>and put it together in a dish...

32
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,070
<1-12,Frank>再放进另一个女人的子宫里
<1-12,Frank>and then put it into another girl.

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,010
<1-12,Frank>不知道你愿不愿意让我们向你借腹生子
<1-12,Frank>So, we were wondering if you could be that girl that we could put it into.

34
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,980
<1-13,Phoebe>这礼物选得还真有水平
<1-13,Phoebe>That's a really nice gift.

35
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,490
<1-13,Phoebe>我还以为你们会想要个酱料皿呢
<1-13,Phoebe>I was thinking of...like a gravy boat.

91
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,780
<2-31,Ross>菲比  你可知道怀孕意味着
<2-31,Ross>Pheebs, you're talking about

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,240
<2-31,Ross>你的身体将经受许多摧残与折磨
<2-31,Ross>You'll put your body through an awful lot.

93

<2-31,Ross>I mean, morning sickness, labor.

94
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,620

<2-34,Rachel>这种事我一定做不到
<2-34,Rachel>I don't know if I could ever do that.

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,020
<2-34,Rachel>我一直憧憬着  自己第一次怀孕
<2-34,Rachel>You know, I always figured the first time I had a baby,

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,830
<3-1,Kathy>一定怀的是我心爱的人的孩子
<3-1,Kathy>it'd be with someone I love.

100
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,730
<2-34,Rachel>而孩子出生之后
<2-34,Rachel>And that baby was, you know...

101
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,500
<2-34,Rachel>一定要留在我身边
<2-34,Rachel>a keeper.

<2-35,Phoebe>when I wanted to make denim furniture.

104
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,110
<2-36,Joey>菲比  如果你心意已决
<2-36,Joey>Oh, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this,

<2-38,Monica>Yeah. We just want you to think it through.

107
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,340
<2-39,Rachel>或许你应该和生过小孩的人
<2-39,Rachel>Yeah, and maybe you could talk to somebody

108
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,850
<2-39,Rachel>讨论一下  比如你妈妈
<2-39,Rachel>who's had a baby. Like your mom.

109
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,960
<2-40,Phoebe>我妈又没生过小孩  不过我的生母生过孩子
<2-40,Phoebe>My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did!

110
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,290
<3-1,Kathy>我喜欢你的小翘臀  可以让我带去上班吗

<3-2,Chandler>没问题  反正也不是我的  是买裤子附赠的
<3-2,Chandler>Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,310
<3-4,Monica>我嫉妒死了
<3-4,Monica>I am so jealous.

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
<3-6,Chandler>投入什么
<3-6,Chandler>Right where?

116
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,960
<3-7,Monica>恋爱初期  除了滚床单就是打情骂俏
<3-7,Monica>The beginning, where, you know, it's all sex and talking...

117
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,790
<3-7,Monica>然后再滚床单  再打情骂俏
<3-7,Monica>and sex and talking and...

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,130
<3-8,Chandler>至少打情骂俏的部分很不错
<3-8,Chandler>Yeah, you got to love the talking.

119
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,650
<3-9,Monica>那滚床单呢
<3-9,Monica>And the sex?

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,240
<3-9,Monica>好吧  我承认我们还没上过床
<3-9,Monica>We haven't had sex.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,740
<3-10,Chandler>有什么好大惊小怪的  这样才特别啊
<3-10,Chandler>Okay, but what's the big deal? You know, this is special.

122
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,230
<3-10,Chandler>我希望先慢慢培养我们的爱情
<3-10,Chandler>I want our love to grow

123
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,740
<3-10,Chandler>然后再进入下一个阶段
<3-10,Chandler>before moving to the next level.

124
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,410
<3-11,Rachel>钱德勒  你这想法太迷人了
<3-11,Rachel>Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.

125
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,410
<3-12,Ross>真是迷人的...
<3-12,Ross>That is really nice...

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,080
<3-12,Ross>谎言
<3-12,Ross>lying!

127
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,250
<3-12,Ross>-不可能是这个原因  -为什么
<3-12,Ross>- No way is that the reason. - Why?

128
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,410
<3-13,Rachel>别以为人人都像你这么不成熟
<3-13,Rachel>Just because you're not mature enough

129
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,450
<3-13,Rachel>无法理解那种境界
<3-13,Rachel>to understand something like that?

130
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,750
<3-14,Chandler>不  他说的对  我撒了个弥天大谎
<3-14,Chandler>No. He's right. I'm totally lying.

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,060
<3-15,Monica>那真相是什么?
<3-15,Monica>Then what is it?

132
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,330
<3-16,Chandler>因为凯茵前任男友是乔伊
<3-16,Chandler>Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.

133
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,900
<3-17,Ross>你担心自己技不如人吗
<3-17,Ross>And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?

134
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,140
<3-18,Chandler>不  我只是担心自己床上功夫没他好
<3-18,Chandler>No. I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.

135
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,560
<3-19,Ross>我本不想把话挑明的
<3-19,Ross>I was going for the metaphor.

136
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,970
<3-20,Chandler>是啊  所以我干脆替你把话说明白了
<3-20,Chandler>I was saying the actual words.

137
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,910
<3-21,Monica>没关系的  就算乔伊交过一卡车女友
<3-21,Monica>What's the big deal? So Joey's had a lot of girlfriends.

138
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,150
<3-21,Monica>也不表示他的床技一流啊
<3-21,Monica>It doesn't mean he's great in bed.

139
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,190
<3-22,Chandler>我和他的卧房仅一墙之隔
<3-22,Chandler>We share a wall.

140
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,800
<3-22,Chandler>若非他真的很强  就是他女友很喜欢跟他互动
<3-22,Chandler>So either he's great in bed,or she just liked to agree with him a lot.

141
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,880
<3-23,Monica>亲爱的  你们的情况不一样
<3-23,Monica>Sweetie, with you, it's gonna be different.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,600
<3-23,Monica>有爱做基础  一定会更性福
<3-23,Monica>The sex will be great because you guys are in love.

143
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,160
<3-24,Chandler>-是吗  -是啊
<3-24,Chandler>- Yeah?  - Yeah!

144
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,660
<3-26,Ross>放手一试吧  钱德勒
<3-26,Ross>Just go for it, Chandler.

145
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,410
<3-27,Monica>-试试看就知道了  -没错  加油
<3-27,Monica>- Yeah, you should. -Come on, really.

146
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,510
<3-29,Monica>好吧  我去跟女友滚床单
<3-29,Monica>All right. I'll sleep with my girlfriend.

147
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,250
<3-30,Chandler>但我纯粹是为了成全你们
<3-30,Chandler>But I'm just doing it for you guys.

148
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,520
<4-1,Joey>我们现在看到的这头乳齿象生活在株罗纪半晚期
<4-1,Joey>Okay, now, the mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic Period.

149
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,510
<4-2,Smart Kid>乳齿象不应该是上新世的吗
<4-2,Smart Kid>Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch?

150
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,620
<4-3,Joey>这里是博物馆  不许喧哗
<4-3,Joey>This is a museum. No talking.

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
<4-3,Joey>这里展出的是
<4-3,Joey>Right down here we have...

152
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,420
<4-3,Joey>一只大脚
<4-3,Joey>a large foot.

153
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,930
<4-3,Joey>这位是罗斯·盖勒
<4-3,Joey>And over here we have Ross Geller.

154
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,270
<4-3,Joey>大家和罗斯打个招呼吧
<4-3,Joey>Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.

155
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,560
<4-3,Joey>罗斯是馆内最重要的科学家之一
<4-3,Joey>Ross is one of our most important scientists.

156
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,710
<4-3,Joey>看他工作得多卖力
<4-3,Joey>Look at him hard at work.

157
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,750
<4-3,Joey>好  我们继续参观吧
<4-3,Joey>Okay, moving right along.

158
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,320
<4-3,Joey>走吧
<4-3,Joey>Come on.

159
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,950
<5-1,Phoebe Sr>门没锁  请进
<5-1,Phoebe Sr>It's open. Come in.

160
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,090
<5-4,Phoebe>-抱歉迟到了  -没关系
<5-4,Phoebe>- I'm sorry I'm late. - Oh. That's okay.

161
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,890
<5-5,Phoebe Sr>我正好有时间给我的乳头上釉
<5-5,Phoebe Sr>It give me time to finish glazing my nipples.

162
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,160
<5-6,Phoebe>为了见客  还真是大费周章啊
<5-6,Phoebe>Wow, you really go all out when you're expecting company.

163
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,870
<5-7,Phoebe Sr>你想多了  我说的是陶器
<5-7,Phoebe Sr>No. I was working on my pottery.

164
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,110
<5-8,Phoebe>我不知道你会捏泥人啊
<5-8,Phoebe>Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.

165
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,890
<5-9,Phoebe Sr>对  而且大多是裸体人像
<5-9,Phoebe Sr>Oh yeah. Mostly nudes.

166
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,420
<5-9,Phoebe Sr>这结合我的两种爱好  陶艺与色情
<5-9,Phoebe Sr>It combines my two passions: Pottery and erotica.

167
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,550
<5-10,Phoebe>-就叫做"陶情"吧  -行啊
<5-10,Phoebe>- Erottery! - Okay!

168
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,930
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>谢谢你来看我
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>Thanks for coming out to see me.

169
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,920
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>我只是觉得生孩子这件事
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>I just, I just thought it'd be a very good idea

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,150
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>还是当面聊比较好
<5-11,Phoebe Sr>to talk about this baby stuff in person, you know.

171
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,630
<5-13,Phoebe Sr>菲比  我觉得这样不妥
<5-13,Phoebe Sr>I really don't think it's a good idea, Phoebe.

172
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,340
<5-14,Phoebe>为什么
<5-14,Phoebe>Why not?

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,840
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>因为你得把你生下来的孩子送给别人
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>Well, because you'd be giving up a baby.

174
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,840
<5-13,Phoebe Sr>我不知道...
<5-13,Phoebe Sr>And I really don't...

175
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,100
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>不知道要怎么说...
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>I don't know if anything I said...

176
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,210
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>你才会懂送走孩子会有多么痛苦
<5-15,Phoebe Sr>that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.

177
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,070
<5-16,Phoebe>不  我能体会那种痛苦
<5-16,Phoebe>No, no, I understand the pain.

178
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,950
<5-16,Phoebe>千万  不要伤害小狗
<5-16,Phoebe>Don't...don't hurt the puppy!

179
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,360
<5-17,Phoebe Sr>不  不是  这小狗是你的了
<5-17,Phoebe Sr>No, no. The puppy is yours.

180
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,820
<5-19,Phoebe Sr>-送我了  -对  但只给你3天
<5-19,Phoebe Sr>- I get a puppy? - Yeah, I mean, but for only three days.

181
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,460
<5-20,Phoebe>为什么
<5-20,Phoebe>Why?

182
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,770
<5-20,Phoebe>我知道我早已无权
<5-20,Phoebe>Well, you know, I realize I don't have any right

183
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,970
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>搬出为人父母的权威来向你说教
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>to start getting all parenty on you everything now.

184
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,760
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>菲比  请你别看小狗了
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>Phoebe, would you please look at me

185
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,410
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>看着我  我要说很重要的事
<5-21,Phoebe Sr>and not the puppy. It's very important.

186
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,580
<5-22,Phoebe>我下面要说的话  句句发自肺腑
<5-22,Phoebe>I mean, I know what I'm talking about.

187
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,650
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>我曾将两个亲生孩子送给别人
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>I gave up two babies.

188
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,680
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>真希望当时能有遗弃过孩子的前辈来告诉我
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>I only wish I had someone who'd given up babies that told me...

189
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,010
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>送走自己的小孩会有多痛苦
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>how terrible it is to give up babies.

190
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,170
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>我只是觉得送走孩子后
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>I just think that it'd be something

191
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,390
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>在你的有生之年  每天都会饱尝悔恨
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>you'd regret every single day for the rest of your life.

192
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,280
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>你送走这条小狗的痛苦
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...

193
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,400
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>远不及送走孩子的痛苦的百万分之一
<5-23,Phoebe Sr>it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.

194
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,240
<6-1,Joey>你能不能坐对面  我帮朋友罗斯留了位置
<6-1,Joey>Could you sit there? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,570
<6-2,Tour Guide>你是说盖勒博士
<6-2,Tour Guide>You mean Dr. Geller?

196
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,970
<6-3,Joey>博士  我还不知道他有这绰号
<6-3,Joey>Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,080
<6-4,Tour Guide>他才不会坐这里呢
<6-4,Tour Guide>Oh, he won't sit here.

198
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,440
<6-4,Tour Guide>穿白色工作服的人都会坐在那里
<6-4,Tour Guide>Only people in white coats sit there.

199
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,620
<6-4,Tour Guide>而穿蓝色外套的只能坐这里
<6-4,Tour Guide>Only people in blue blazers sit here.

200
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,020
<6-6,Tour Guide>-为什么这样  -一向如此
<6-6,Tour Guide>- How come? - That's just the way it is.

201
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,090
<6-7,Joey>岂有此理
<6-7,Joey>That's crazy.

202
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,450
<6-8,Tour Guide>或许在不分蓝白的完美世界里
<6-8,Tour Guide>Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world:

203
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,630
<6-8,Tour Guide>你的确可以抱怨"岂有此理"
<6-8,Tour Guide>a world without lab coats and blazers.

204
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,200
<6-8,Tour Guide>但你不是活在完美世界  这里是博物馆
<6-8,Tour Guide>But you not in a perfect world.You in a museum now.

205
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,010
<6-8,Tour Guide>看到那戴眼镜的科学家没
<6-8,Tour Guide>See that scientist with glasses?

206
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,170
<6-8,Tour Guide>想当年我们念小学  总在一起玩  但现在呢
<6-8,Tour Guide>He and I used to play together in grade school, but now....

207
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,680
<6-8,Tour Guide>彼得  嘿  彼得
<6-8,Tour Guide>Peter! Hey, Peter!

<6-8,Tour Guide>It's me! Rhonda, from P.S. 129?

209
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,380
<6-8,Tour Guide>亏我把布丁分你吃过
<6-8,Tour Guide>I shared my pudding with you, man!

210
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,590
<6-8,Tour Guide>我还把点心棒送给你吃过呢
<6-8,Tour Guide>I gave you my Snack Pack!

211
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,760
<6-8,Tour Guide>看到没  他假装统统没听到
<6-8,Tour Guide>See? He pretend he don't even hear me!

212
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,870
<6-9,Joey>我想大家都在假装没听到
<6-9,Joey>I think everyone's pretending they don't hear you.

213
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,040
<6-9,Joey>我是不懂什么蓝白制服之别
<6-9,Joey>Anyway, I don't know about you

214
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,090
<6-9,Joey>还有什么分桌吃饭的规矩...
<6-9,Joey>and your jackets and your separate tables...

215
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,190
<6-9,Joey>不过罗斯是我的死党
<6-9,Joey>but Ross is one of my best friend.

216
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,280
<6-9,Joey>如果我帮他留了位置
<6-9,Joey>And if I save him a seat,

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,470
<6-9,Joey>我向你打包票  他一定会坐
<6-9,Joey>I'm telling you, he will sit in it.

218
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,810
<6-9,Joey>罗斯  来这儿坐  我帮你留了位置
<6-9,Joey>Ross! Over here, man. I saved you a seat!

<6-10,Ross>我坐这里就好  待会儿再去找你聊
<6-10,Ross>I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later.

220
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,670
<6-11,Tour Guide>这个位置有人了
<6-11,Tour Guide>This is saved.

221
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,660
<6-11,Tour Guide>她是礼品店的
<6-11,Tour Guide>Gift shop.

222
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,350
<7-1,Ross>我要向你道歉
<7-1,Ross>I'm really, really sorry about

223
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,260
<7-1,Ross>为今天发生在餐厅的事情
<7-1,Ross>what happened in the cafeteria today.

224
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,110
<7-2,Joey>这没什么  你该怎样就怎样吧
<7-2,Joey>It's no big deal. You know, you do what you got to do.

225
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,410
<7-3,Ross>别这样  不是只有我一人这样做
<7-3,Ross>No, hey, it's not just me.

226
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,850
<7-3,Ross>科学家和导览员从来是不坐在一起的
<7-3,Ross>I mean, the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.

227
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,480
<7-4,Joey>随你的便
<7-4,Joey>Whatever.

228
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,170
<7-5,Ross>乔伊  每家企业都是这样的
<7-5,Ross>It's like that everywhere, Joey.

<7-5,Ross>莫妮卡  帮我说说话啊
<7-5,Ross>Okay, Mon, back me up here.

230
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,730
<7-5,Ross>在你工作的地方  侍者和侍者一起吃饭
<7-5,Ross>Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters, right?

231
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,460
<7-5,Ross>厨师和厨师吃饭  对吧
<7-5,Ross>And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?

232
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,110
<7-6,Monica>我是自己躲在巷子里吃  因为大家都恨我
<7-6,Monica>I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.

233
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,040
<7-6,Monica>罗斯  你听我说
<7-6,Monica>Look, Ross.

00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,840
<7-7,Joey>这没什么大不了的
<7-7,Joey>It's no big deal.

235
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,350
<7-7,Joey>你穿白色工作服  我穿蓝色外套
<7-7,Joey>You wear a white coat. I wear a blue blazer.

236
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,040
<7-7,Joey>若这表示上班期间不能当朋友  我也接受
<7-7,Joey>If that means we can't be friends at work, so be it.

237
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,050
<7-7,Joey>我能理解
<7-7,Joey>I understand, you know?

238
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,950
<7-8,Rachel>我演舞台剧  你坐观众席
<7-8,Rachel>When I'm in a play and you're in the audience,

239
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,120
<7-8,Rachel>我也不会跟你说话  是吧
<7-8,Rachel>I don't talk to you.

240
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,390
<7-7,Joey>所以没事了

<7-7,Joey>I'll see you tomorrow.

242
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,790
<7-8,Rachel>我们当观众的时候
<7-8,Rachel>When we're in the audience,

243
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,740
<7-8,Rachel>他是不跟我们说话
<7-8,Rachel>he doesn't talk to us,

244
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,640
<7-8,Rachel>但却会向我们招手
<7-8,Rachel>but he does wave.

245
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,600
<8-3,Chandler>菲比为什么要唱歌给卡尔·马登听
<8-3,Chandler>Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?

246
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,440
<8-3,Chandler>我好像又该去遛狗了
<8-3,Chandler>You know what? I think it's time for puppy to go out again.

247
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,910
<8-4,Phoebe>走  我们去阳台
<8-4,Phoebe>Come on, let's go to the balcony.

248
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,570
<8-6,Phoebe>什么  去大街上  走吧  我们遛大街去
<8-6,Phoebe>What? The street. Come on, let's go to the street.

249
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,220
<8-6,Phoebe>对了  在我回来之前  你们都别去阳台
<8-6,Phoebe>Oh, listen, don't go on the balcony until after I get back.

250
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,180
<8-7,Monica>你做了没

252
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
<8-9,Monica>很糟糕吗
<8-9,Monica>It was bad?

253
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,370
<8-10,Chandler>好是好  但是她附和我的程度
<8-10,Chandler>It was fine, you know, but she didn't agree with me

254
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,270
<8-10,Chandler>不像附和乔伊那样强烈
<8-10,Chandler>as strongly as with Joey.

255
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,610
<8-10,Chandler>感觉像是  "我知道你有多大能耐了
<8-10,Chandler>She was like, "L see your point.

256
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,770
<8-10,Chandler>既然如此  就这样吧"
<8-10,Chandler>I'm all right with it."

257
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,020
<8-11,Monica>这才第一次嘛
<8-11,Monica>It was the first time, you know.

258
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,240
<8-11,Monica>第一次的互动总是比较生疏
<8-11,Monica>There's not always a lot of agreement the first time.

259
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,460
<8-12,Rachel>对  女人需要慢慢来
<8-12,Rachel>Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.

260
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,380
<8-12,Rachel>不像男生  一碰就互动了
<8-12,Rachel>Guys agree like that.

261
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,410
<8-13,Chandler>你们得帮帮我
<8-13,Chandler>Look, you have to help me, okay?

<8-13,Chandler>我的那些经历都很美好
<8-13,Chandler>It's always nice.

266
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,290
<8-13,Chandler>但我想知道  怎样才能从"美好"进阶到
<8-13,Chandler>I need to know...what makes it go from nice to:

267
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,400
<8-13,Chandler>"天呐  听听那动静  真像是谋杀"
<8-13,Chandler>"My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"

<8-21,Chandler>反过来看会有误差嘛
<8-21,Chandler>Oh, you know, I was looking at it upside down.

284
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,040
<8-22,Rachel>有时候反过来也不错
<8-22,Rachel>Well, you know, sometimes that helps.

287
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,380

<8-24,Chandler>That's bad?

<9-2,Ross>...at this table. Here in the middle.

316
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,970
<9-2,Ross>我就在这张桌子前...
<9-2,Ross>I'm having my lunch...

317
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,010
<9-2,Ross>和我的好友乔伊一起吃午餐
<9-2,Ross>...right here with my good friend, Joey.

<9-4,Ross>我们在自然史博物馆工作

322
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:17,750
<9-4,Ross>然而我们吃午饭的方式  却很不自然
<9-4,Ross>And yet, there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.

323
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,770
<9-4,Ross>我环顾这餐厅的四周  看到了什么
<9-4,Ross>Now, I look around this cafeteria, and you know what

324
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,090
<9-4,Ross>我看到了隔阂

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,460
<9-4,Ross>彼此间有着深深的隔阂
<9-4,Ross>and people in blue blazers.

327
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,650
<9-4,Ross>我扪心自问  "天啊  这是为什么"
<9-4,Ross>I ask myself, "My God, why?"

328
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,930
<9-4,Ross>我建议大家脱掉
<9-4,Ross>Now, I say we shed these coats...

329
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,820
<9-4,Ross>这些为我们制造隔阂的外套
<9-4,Ross>that separate us.

330
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,030
<9-4,Ross>这样我们才能有机会了解衣冠之下的人心
<9-4,Ross>And we get to know the people underneath.

<9-15,Another Scientist>17 times before I leave a room...

346
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,260

<9-15,Another Scientist>or my family will die.

347
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,350
<10-1,Phoebe>我妈快来了
<10-1,Phoebe>My mom's gonna be here any minute.

<10-2,Rachel>不行
<10-2,Rachel>No.

353
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,960

<10-2,Rachel>I can't watch this.

354
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,780
<10-2,Rachel>简直像《苏菲的选择》那么凄惨
<10-2,Rachel>It's like Sophie's Choice.

355
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,070
<10-3,Monica>我从没看过那部电影

<10-4,Rachel>我办不到
<10-4,Rachel>I can't do this.

358
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,920
<10-5,Phoebe>我妈妈说的对  我连一条狗都舍不得
<10-5,Phoebe>My mom was right. If I can't give him up...

359
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,420
<10-5,Phoebe>怎么可能送走自己生的小孩
<10-5,Phoebe>there's no way I can give up a little baby.

360
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,690
<10-5,Phoebe>弗兰克和爱丽丝一定会很伤心
<10-5,Phoebe>Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed.

<10-9,Frank>We just stop by and want to let you know

364
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,970
<10-9,Frank>千万不要有压力
<10-9,Frank>that there's still no pressure.

365
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,040
<10-10,Alice>但是如果你有事要跟我们说
<10-10,Alice>But if there was something you wanted to tell us,

366
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,880
<10-10,Alice>我们就坐在那里喝咖啡

<10-15,Alice>太可人疼了  真想带你回家
