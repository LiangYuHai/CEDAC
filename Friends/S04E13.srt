<2-7,Rachel>which is a huge step down.

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,690
<2-8,Phoebe>专人采购部是干什么的
<2-8,Phoebe>Personal Shopping, what is that?

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,000

46
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,060
<2-10,Phoebe>这活儿真不错
<2-10,Phoebe>That sounds great!

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,440
<2-11,Joey>拜托  我们交换了公寓
<2-11,Joey>Excuse me. We switched apartments.

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,470
<2-12,Monica>不许再来蹭吃蹭喝  没有免费的午餐
<2-12,Monica>You can't eat our food anymore. That gravy train has ended.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,570
<2-13,Joey>还有午餐呢
<2-13,Joey>There's gravy?

50
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,600
<2-14,Monica>住的房子大
<2-14,Monica>If you have the big apartment,

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,710
<2-14,Monica>就得应付人来人往
<2-14,Monica>you have to deal with people coming over all the time.

52
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,450
<2-14,Monica>冰箱里必须常备着食品和饮料
<2-14,Monica>That fridge has to be stocked.

53
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,710
<2-14,Monica>对面现在是你们住了
<2-14,Monica>That's your apartment now.

54
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,050
<2-15,Monica>你干什么?
<2-15,Monica>What are you doing?

55
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,180
<2-16,Joey>我好像在这里藏过一只甜甜圈
<2-16,Joey>I think I left a doughnut up here.

56
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,460
<3-3,Joey>凯西的戏怎样
<3-3,Joey>How was Kathy's play?

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
<3-4,Phoebe>凯西在台上半裸着
<3-4,Phoebe>Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex

58
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,960
<3-5,Ross>跟一个大帅哥演床戏
<3-5,Ross>with a real good-looking guy.

59
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,160
<3-6,Chandler>这就好比有人把我的恶梦写成戏
<3-6,Chandler>It's like somebody literally wrote down my worst nightmare...

60
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,340
<3-6,Chandler>还要我花32块去看
<3-6,Chandler>and then charged me $32 to see it.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,570
<3-7,Phoebe>这个点子有赚头
<3-7,Phoebe>That's a good idea for a business.

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
<3-8,Chandler>我完蛋了
<3-8,Chandler>I'm totally screwed, okay?

63
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,750
<3-8,Chandler>他们会夜夜在台上打得火热
<3-8,Chandler>They're gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night...

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,160
<3-8,Chandler>然后去参加剧组派对的时候
<3-8,Chandler>then they'll go to their little cast parties,

65
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,750
<3-8,Chandler>他一定会设法中伤我
<3-8,Chandler>and he's gonna try to undermine me.

66
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,600
<3-8,Chandler>也许他会问  "你男朋友呢
<3-8,Chandler>You know, he'll be like, "So, where's your boyfriend?

67
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,440
<3-8,Chandler>他叫什么  钱斯特吗"
<3-8,Chandler>What's his name? Chester?"

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,290
<3-8,Chandler>她会说  "不  是钱德勒"
<3-8,Chandler>And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler."

69
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,990
<3-8,Chandler>然后他便说  "反正都差不多"
<3-8,Chandler>And he'll go, "Whatever!"

70
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,220
<3-9,Joey>这招的确不错
<3-9,Joey>That is a good trick.

71
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,890
<3-10,Chandler>帮我想想  我该怎么办
<3-10,Chandler>All right, look. What am I going to do?

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,540
<3-11,Joey>钱德勒  想开点  他们是演员
<3-11,Joey>Chandler. Look, they're actors.

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,100
<3-11,Joey>演戏是本职工作
<3-11,Joey>They're there to do a job.

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,220
<3-11,Joey>假戏不一定
<3-11,Joey>Just because they work together

75
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,640
<3-11,Joey>就会真做
<3-11,Joey>doesn't mean they're gonna get together.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,110
<3-11,Joey>发生在苏珊·莎兰登
<3-11,Joey>I mean, just because it happened with like

78
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,710
<3-11,Joey>和提姆·罗宾斯身上的事情
<3-11,Joey>Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...

79
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,940
<3-11,Joey>不一定会发生在他们身上
<3-11,Joey>doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.

80
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,150
<3-12,Ross>还有亚历克·鲍德温和金·贝辛格
<3-12,Ross>Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

82
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,340
<3-13,Joey>汤姆·克鲁斯和妮可·基德曼
<3-13,Joey>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

83
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,150
<3-15,Phoebe>梅尔·吉布森和克林特·伊斯特伍德
<3-15,Phoebe>Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

84
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,510
<3-16,Ross>他们又不是一对
<3-16,Ross>They're not a couple.

85
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,490
<3-17,Phoebe>我终于明白你们在玩什么了
<3-17,Phoebe>Okay, I get the game now.

86
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,440
<3-18,Joey>我来问你个问题
<3-18,Joey>Look, let me ask you a question.

87
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,110
<3-18,Joey>他们演床戏时很有激情吗
<3-18,Joey>When they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?

88
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,790
<3-20,Joey>既然是这样  你就放心吧
<3-20,Joey>Well, okay, so you're fine.

89
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,850
<3-20,Joey>表演界金科玉律  若演员私底下是一对
<3-20,Joey>The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage...

90
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,010
<3-20,Joey>到了舞台上  他们之间的火花就会消失
<3-20,Joey>then all the sexual tension between them is gone.

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,060
<3-20,Joey>所以只要台上很火热
<3-20,Joey>As long as it's hot on stage,

92
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,900
<3-20,Joey>你就完全不必担心
<3-20,Joey>you got nothing to worry about.

93
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,830
<3-20,Joey>而如果哪一天热度不见了  你就真完蛋了
<3-20,Joey>It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.

94
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,940
<3-21,Chandler>真的
<3-21,Chandler>Really?

95
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,210
<3-22,Joey>你们看过我演的每出戏
<3-22,Joey>You guys have been to every play I've been in.

96
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,080
<3-22,Joey>我在台上跟别人擦出过火花吗
<3-22,Joey>Have I ever had chemistry on stage?

97
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,510
<3-22,Joey>-没有  -对吧
<3-22,Joey>- No. - No!

98
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,510
<4-1,Chandler>你晚上陪我去看戏吗
<4-1,Chandler>So, man, are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,640
<4-2,Ross>我觉得让我去评断你女朋友跟其他男人
<4-2,Ross>I don't know how comfortable I am going to see

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,890
<4-2,Ross>滚床单滚得有多激情  会很尴尬的
<4-2,Ross>how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.

101
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,500
<4-3,Chandler>-我知道  但是  -不用说了  我也听见了
<4-3,Chandler>- I know, but... - No, I'm there.

102
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,070
<4-6,Joey>莫妮卡  吃煎饼吗

<4-8,Joey>Yep. Grab a plate.

105
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,530
<4-9,Monica>别过来  待在那儿
<4-9,Monica>No, no. Stay right there.

<4-10,Joey>越来越近了
<4-10,Joey>Getting closer.

107
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
<4-11,Chandler>没关系  大家别担心...
<4-11,Chandler>Okay, okay. But don't worry...

108
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,490
<4-11,Chandler>因为我们还有麦片  松糕  华夫饼
<4-11,Chandler>because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles

109

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,820
<4-11,Chandler>我觉得其实是同一种东西
<4-11,Chandler>which I'm fairly certain the same thing.

111

<6-12,Ross>你们慢聊...
<6-12,Ross>Okay...

171
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,000
<6-14,Chandler>拜托  这也太明显了
<6-14,Chandler>Oh, come on. It was so obvious.

172
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,560
<6-14,Chandler>你们俩在台上毫无激情可言
<6-14,Chandler>There was no chemistry between you two.

<6-15,Kathy>好  让我理理清楚

<6-15,Kathy>你既指责我不忠
<6-15,Kathy>You're accusing me of cheating on you,

175
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,000
<6-15,Kathy>同时又侮辱我的演技
<6-15,Kathy>and you're insulting my performance?

176
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,250
<6-16,Chandler>不过这也难怪
<6-16,Chandler>You know, I can see how this could happen.

<7-32,Monica>这里绝对要比对面好十倍
<7-32,Monica>it's gonna be 10 times better than that place.

237
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,570
<7-33,Phoebe>我们要捣毁对面吗
<7-33,Phoebe>Are we gonna trash their place?

238
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,110
<7-34,Chandler>该死的台阶
<7-34,Chandler>There's steps!

239
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,450
<7-34,Chandler>臭婆娘
<7-34,Chandler>Slut!

240
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,120
<7-34,Chandler>凯西真的跟那个人上床了
<7-34,Chandler>You'll all be very happy to hear

241
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
<7-34,Chandler>你们听到一定欢欣鼓舞吧
<7-34,Chandler>that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!

242
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,390
<7-36,Ross>-什么  -你猜对了
<7-36,Ross>- What? - You were right?

243
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,250
<7-37,Chandler>我当面质问她  她没有否认
<7-37,Chandler>I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.

244
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,570
<7-37,Chandler>我不住这里
<7-37,Chandler>I don't live here!

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,980
<7-39,Rachel>-钱德  -等等  你确定吗
<7-39,Rachel>- Chandler. - Wait, are you sure?

246
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,870
<7-41,Joey>我是醉了  但我听得懂她的话
<7-41,Joey>I may be drunk, but I know what she said.

247
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,700
<7-43,Chandler>所以我跑去朱理牛排...
<7-43,Chandler>So then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's...

248
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,000
<7-44,Rachel>-是查理牛排吗  -对
<7-44,Rachel>- Beefsteak Charlie's? - Yes!

249
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,370
<7-45,Chandler>瞧  咱俩一向都很...
<7-45,Chandler>See, you and I have always been like:

250
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,290
<8-1,Rachel>-需要帮忙吗  -不用  我来就行了
<8-1,Rachel>- Do you need help with that? - Nah, I got it.

251
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,680
<8-3,Rachel>真惭愧  我从来没吸过地板
<8-3,Rachel>I just feel bad. I never vacuum.

252
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,260
<9-2,All>今天我跟约书亚相处了一个小时
<9-2,All>So, I was with Joshua for an hour today,

253
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,410
<9-3,Rachel>他却没有向我提出要约会
<9-3,Rachel>and he has not asked me out.

254
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,680
<9-4,Phoebe>-真泄气  -那就你约他嘛
<9-4,Phoebe>- Just so frustrating. - Why don't you ask him out?

255
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,250
<9-5,Joey>没错  这绝对会勾起男人的欲望
<9-5,Joey>Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.

256
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,190
<9-6,Rachel>是吗  不会显得很饥渴吗
<9-6,Rachel>Really? It doesn't seem desperate?

257
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,420
<9-7,Joey>所以才能吊起男人的胃口啊
<9-7,Joey>That's the turn-on.

258
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,750
<9-8,Phoebe>他刚离婚  对吧
<9-8,Phoebe>He just got a divorce. Right?

259
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,050
<9-9,Rachel>所以他跟女人相处可能会紧张
<9-9,Rachel>So he's probably really nervous around women.

260
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,490
<9-10,Phoebe>也许你需要先主动出击一回嘛
<9-10,Phoebe>You know, maybe you just need to make the first move.

261
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,490
<9-11,Rachel>可是我没约过男生
<9-11,Rachel>I've never asked a guy out before.

262
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,460
<9-12,Phoebe>你没约过男生
<9-12,Phoebe>You've never asked a guy out?

263
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,690
<9-13,Rachel>没有  你有吗
<9-13,Rachel>No. Have you?

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,940
<9-14,Phoebe>数都数不清了
<9-14,Phoebe>Thousands of times!

265
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,710
<9-14,Phoebe>这也不是什么光荣的事  是吧
<9-14,Phoebe>That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?

266
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,030
<9-15,Rachel>我连怎么开口都不会
<9-15,Rachel>I don't even know how I would go about it.

267
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,560
<9-16,Joey>我最擅长的一手就是  上下打量一位女士
<9-16,Joey>What I do is, I look a woman up and down,

268
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,600
<9-16,Joey>然后说  "嘿  你好吗"
<9-16,Joey>and I say..."Hey. How you doing?"

269
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,400
<9-17,Phoebe>拜托
<9-17,Phoebe>Oh, please!

270
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,060
<9-18,Joey>嘿  你好吗
<9-18,Joey>Hey. How you doing?

271
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,710
<9-18,Joey>好吧  我决定了
<9-18,Joey>You know what? I'm gonna do that.

272
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,840
<10-1,Chandler>我这就给他打电话  约他出来
<10-1,Chandler>I'm gonna call him up and I'm gonna ask him out.

273
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,210
<10-2,Phoebe>有什么难的  说约就约
<10-2,Phoebe>I can do that, ask him out.

274
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,880
<10-3,Chandler>"你好吗"
<10-3,Chandler>"How you doing?"

275
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,350
<10-4,Joey>你好  约书亚
<10-4,Joey>Hi, Joshua.

276

<10-5,Ross>我是布明岱尔百货的瑞秋·葛林
<10-5,Ross>It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.

277
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,800
<10-6,Chandler>对  我想问你...
<10-6,Chandler>Yeah, I was just wondering if you...

278
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,460
<9-17,Phoebe>问你...
<9-17,Phoebe>if you...

279
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,950
<9-18,Joey>是不是把钱包丢在商场了
<9-18,Joey>left your wallet at the store today?

280
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,860
<9-19,Rachel>我们检到一个皮夹...
<9-19,Rachel>We found a wallet, and we...

281
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,700
<9-19,Rachel>看驾照  真是好主意
<9-19,Rachel>The license? That is a good idea.

282
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,230
<9-19,Rachel>我看看  驾照是...
<9-19,Rachel>Well, let's see. This license belongs to...

283
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,670
<9-19,Rachel>一位名叫菲比的先生的
<9-19,Rachel>belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.

284
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,150
<9-19,Rachel>很抱歉在休息时间打扰你
<9-19,Rachel>So sorry to bother you at home.

<9-20,Phoebe>I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

286
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,910
<9-20,Phoebe>你真的这样干过几千次吗
<9-20,Phoebe>You've done that a thousand times?

287
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,290
<9-20,Phoebe>我可没你这么拐弯抹角
<9-20,Phoebe>I've never done that.

288
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,590
<9-21,Rachel>我好怕他会拒绝
<9-21,Rachel>I just got so nervous that he'd say no.

289
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,830
<9-22,Joey>你得给他点无法拒绝的东西  比如说...
<9-22,Joey>You gotta give him something he can't say no to, like...

290
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,740
<9-22,Joey>像尼克队的球票  找他去看尼克队的比赛
<9-22,Joey>Knicks tickets. Invite the guy to a Knicks game.

291
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,200
<9-22,Joey>我保证  他一定会答应
<9-22,Joey>You're guaranteed he'll say yes.

292
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,270
<9-23,Rachel>真的吗  你觉得会有用
<9-23,Rachel>Really? You think that'll work?

293
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,720
<9-24,Joey>当然  如果没用  富余的票归我成吗
<9-24,Joey>Absolutely. And if doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?

294
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,940
<9-25,Joey>什么声音
<9-25,Joey>What the heck is that?

295
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,350
<10-1,Chandler>她给我打过电话吗
<10-1,Chandler>Did she call?

296
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,930
<10-2,Phoebe>没有  抱歉
<10-2,Phoebe>No. Sorry.

297
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,220
<10-3,Chandler>也许我应该打给她
<10-3,Chandler>Maybe I should call her.

298
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,800
<10-4,Joey>别  忘了她吧  你不需要她
<10-4,Joey>No. Forget her, man. You don't need her.

299
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,820
<10-4,Joey>别再让自己窝火了
<10-4,Joey>You don't need that.

300
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,280
<10-5,Ross>没错  她的行为很不可原谅
<10-5,Ross>He's right. What she did was unforgivable.

301
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
<10-6,Chandler>话虽没错  但要是我弄错了呢
<10-6,Chandler>Well, yeah, but, you know, what if I was wrong?

302
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,070
<10-7,Ross>你怎么会弄错
<10-7,Ross>How might you be wrong?

303
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,360
<10-8,Chandler>要是她没有真的跟那个人上床呢
<10-8,Chandler>What if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?

304
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,580
<10-9,Joey>老兄  她亲口证实这一点了吗
<10-9,Joey>Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

305
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,010
<10-10,Chandler>她不必亲口说出来
<10-10,Chandler>She didn't have to tell me.

306
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,440
<10-10,Chandler>我看了戏  他们在台上毫无激情
<10-10,Chandler>I saw the play. And there was no heat.

307
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,710
<10-10,Chandler>罗斯  帮我说句话
<10-10,Chandler>Back me up.

308
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,740
<10-11,Ross>你的证据就是这个吗
<10-11,Ross>That's all you're basing this on?

309
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,710
<10-12,Chandler>你这不是帮我说话
<10-12,Chandler>That's not backing me up!

310
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,480
<10-12,Chandler>你说过  "私下有激情  台上就没有...
<10-12,Chandler>Look, you said, "With the offstage and the heat..."

311
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,970
<10-13,Joey>那只是个理论
<10-13,Joey>That was just a theory.

312
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,060
<10-13,Joey>很多理论都无法在现实中践行
<10-13,Joey>There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out:

313
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,850
<10-13,Joey>比如孤枪侠  共产主义  几何学
<10-13,Joey>Lone gunman, communism, geometry.

314
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,770
<10-14,Chandler>天呐
<10-14,Chandler>Oh, my God!

315

<11-13,Rachel>You don't want to do that now?

332
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,160
<11-15,Rachel>不用了

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,310
<12-2,Chandler>我只是想来对你说声对不起
<12-2,Chandler>I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.

345
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,760
<12-2,Chandler>我那天的做法真是太混蛋了
<12-2,Chandler>I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.

346
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,390
<12-2,Chandler>你完全理解你为何那样难过
<12-2,Chandler>And I can completely understand why you were so upset.

347
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,890
<12-3,Kathy>你真希望你能给我打电话
<12-3,Kathy>I really wish you'd called me.

348

<12-4,Chandler>我知道  我也很后梅没给你打
<12-4,Chandler>Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.

349
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,500
<12-4,Chandler>不过我觉得这是好事
<12-4,Chandler>I think this is a good thing, you know?

350
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,680
<12-4,Chandler>我们第一次吵了架
<12-4,Chandler>Cause we've had our first fight,

351
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,260
<12-4,Chandler>现在我们可以迈步向前了
<12-4,Chandler>and now we can move on.

352
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,340
<12-4,Chandler>至少我确定...
<12-4,Chandler>You know, I mean, I know for me, but...

353

<13-2,Rachel>是多一张票  不是两张票
<13-2,Rachel>An extra ticket. Not two tickets.

358
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,600
<13-2,Rachel>我有一张多余的票
<13-2,Rachel>I have an extra ticket.

<13-25,Ross>这是什么意思
<13-25,Ross>What are you saying?

384
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,080
<13-26,Chandler>意思是她很邪恶
<13-26,Chandler>I'm saying that she is a devil woman.

385
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,820
<13-26,Chandler>明白我的意思吧  你自以为很了解她
<13-26,Chandler>You know what I mean, you think you know a person,

386
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,490
<13-26,Chandler>可她一下就变了  跑去跟尼克滚床单
<13-26,Chandler>then they turn around and sleep with Nick.

387
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,000
<13-26,Chandler>尼克和他的胸肌  硕大的咪咪
<13-26,Chandler>Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.

388

<13-26,Chandler>我恨他  我也恨她
<13-26,Chandler>I hate him. And I hate her.

389
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,970
<13-26,Chandler>我不恨她  我爱她  都是我的错
<13-26,Chandler>I don't hate her. I love her. This is all my fault, really.

390
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,560
<13-27,Phoebe>怎么会是你的错
<13-27,Phoebe>How? How is it your fault?

391
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,540
<13-27,Phoebe>因为我应该给她打个电话的
<13-27,Phoebe>Because, I should have called.

392
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,070
<13-28,Chandler>要是那次大吵大闹之后我给她打过电话
<13-28,Chandler>If I had called her after our big, stupid fight,

393
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,270
<13-28,Chandler>她就不会跟尼克约会
<13-28,Chandler>she never would have gone out with Nick.

394
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,710
<13-28,Chandler>他们俩也就不会上床了
<13-28,Chandler>And they wouldn't have ended up in bed together.

395
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,150
<13-28,Chandler>是我自己亲手把她送到了他的怀里
<13-28,Chandler>I threw her at his man-nipples!

396
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,180
<13-29,Rachel>亲爱的  错不在你
<13-29,Rachel>Honey. This is not your fault.

397
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,430
<13-29,Rachel>就算你们俩大吵了一架
<13-29,Rachel>Just because you guys had a fight

398
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,760
<13-29,Rachel>她也不该跟别人上床
<13-29,Rachel>does not justify her sleeping with someone.

399
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,680
<13-30,Ross>除非她以为他们分手了
<13-30,Ross>Well, if she thought they were on a break...
