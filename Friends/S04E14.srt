<1-12,Monica>乔伊  你不该丢下钱德去钓鱼
<1-12,Monica>Hey Joey, I don't think you should leave Chandler alone.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,110
<1-13,Joey>他还穿着运动裤
<1-13,Joey>He's still in his sweats.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,740
<1-13,Joey>这才是第一阶段
<1-13,Joey>That's only phase one.

26
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,460
<1-13,Joey>等他到第二阶段的时候我就回来了
<1-13,Joey>I'll be back for phase two.

<1-17,Ross>There are naked ladies there.

32
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,200
<1-18,Joey>这有助于他过渡到第三阶段
<1-18,Joey>And it helps to get to phase three:

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,440
<1-18,Joey>对别的女人产生性幻想
<1-18,Joey>picturing yourself with other women.

00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,140
<3-29,Rachel>-你好  -你好啊
<3-29,Rachel>- Hi. -Hi.

127
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,850
<3-30,Ross>帮帮忙吧...
<3-30,Ross>So...

128
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,380
<3-32,Ross>不要
<3-32,Ross>No.

129
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,390
<3-33,Rachel>拜托啦
<3-33,Rachel>Come on!

130
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,900
<3-35,Rachel>-应该是她  -等一下
<3-35,Rachel>- Think she's here. - No. Wait, wait.

131
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,950
<3-35,Rachel>罗斯  拜托啦
<3-35,Rachel>Ross, please?

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,730
<3-36,Ross>你要我带一个陌生女孩去看歌剧
<3-36,Ross>You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera...

133
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,620
<3-36,Ross>好让你去夜总会跟某个男人打情骂俏
<3-36,Ross>so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?

134
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,290
<3-36,Ross>真难决定啊
<3-36,Ross>That is a toughie.

135
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,860
<3-37,Monica>她到走廊了
<3-37,Monica>She's looking down the hall.

136
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,500
<3-37,Monica>她直勾勾地盯着我呢
<3-37,Monica>She looked right at me.

137
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,910
<3-37,Monica>透过猫眼是看不到的  对吧
<3-37,Monica>You can't see people through that hole, can you?

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,270
<3-38,Woman>-你好啊  -你好啊
<3-38,Woman>- Hello. - Hello.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,630
<3-39,Rachel>马上就来  罗斯  拜托啦
<3-39,Rachel>I'll be right there! Okay, Ross, please, come on.

140
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,730
<3-39,Rachel>我觉得我们应该都已经走出来了
<3-39,Rachel>I thought we had moved on.

141
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,570
<3-39,Rachel>我觉得我们已经可以彼此祝福了
<3-39,Rachel>I thought we come to a place where we could be happy for each other.

142
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,490
<3-39,Rachel>难道只有我走出来了
<3-39,Rachel>I mean, was that just me?

143
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,900
<3-40,Ross>好吧  我带她去
<3-40,Ross>All right, I'll do it.

144
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,870
<3-41,Rachel>谢谢你  谢谢
<3-41,Rachel>Thank you, thank you.

145
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,770
<3-42,Emily>-艾蜜莉  -我是
<3-42,Emily>- Emily. - Yes.

146
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,260
<3-43,Rachel>我是瑞秋·格林
<3-43,Rachel>I'm Rachel Green.

147
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,590
<3-44,Emily>谢天谢地
<3-44,Emily>Thank goodness!

148
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,310
<3-45,Rachel>计划有小小的变动
<3-45,Rachel>There's been a teeny teeny change of plans.

149
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,970
<3-45,Rachel>我今晚临时有事...所以...
<3-45,Rachel>Turns out I'm not free tonight...so...

150
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,900
<3-45,Rachel>是吗
<3-45,Rachel>Really?

151
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,100
<3-46,Emily>太好了  我一定是没接到电话
<3-46,Emily>That's just lovely, isn't it. I must've missed your call,

152
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,010
<3-46,Emily>虽然我整天都没出门
<3-46,Emily>even though I didn't leave the flat all day.

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,780
<3-47,Rachel>我
<3-47,Rachel>Well, l...

154
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,330
<3-47,Rachel>不  这也没什么
<3-47,Rachel>No no no. That's not rude.

155
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,150
<3-48,Emily>自打我来到这里就诸事不顺...
<3-48,Emily>It's perfectly in keeping with the trip...

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,090
<3-48,Emily>先是被你们的热狗车撞倒
<3-48,Emily>where I've already been run down by one of your wiener cars...

157
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,800
<3-48,Emily>在肯尼迪国际机场又被脱衣服搜身
<3-48,Emily>and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport,

158
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,190
<3-48,Emily>你们美国人显然认为
<3-48,Emily>apparently to you people,

159
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,020
<3-48,Emily>我长得就像屁股里
<3-48,Emily>I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine

160
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,320
<3-48,Emily>塞了可卡因的人
<3-48,Emily>stuffed up their bum.

161
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,910
<3-49,Monica>我觉得你很漂亮啊
<3-49,Monica>I think you look great.

162
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,550
<3-50,Emily>晚安  很高兴认识你们
<3-50,Emily>Good night. It was very nice to meet you all.

163
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
<3-51,Rachel>我去追她
<3-51,Rachel>I'll get her.

164
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,880
<3-52,Ross>快去吧
<3-52,Ross>Please, hurry.

165
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,850
<3-53,Phoebe>他们讲话好好玩
<3-53,Phoebe>Don't you just love the way they talk?

166
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,680
<4-3,Phoebe>-怎么了  -宝宝在踢我
<4-3,Phoebe>- What? - It kicked, I think the baby kicked!

167
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,630
<4-4,Monica>天啊
<4-4,Monica>Oh, my God.

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,620
<4-5,Phoebe>不对  是内裤的松紧带断了
<4-5,Phoebe>No, wait. The elastic in my underwear busted.

169
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,020
<4-4,Monica>完了  我睡过头了
<4-4,Monica>Oh, my God! I overslept!

170
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,700
<4-6,Joey>半小时前就应该到的
<4-6,Joey>I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago!

171
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,270
<4-6,Joey>我得赶快
<4-6,Joey>I gotta get out of here!

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,030
<4-7,Monica>乔伊  你不能这样去  你臭死了
<4-7,Monica>Oh wait, Joey, you can't go like that! You stink!

173
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
<4-8,Joey>我没洗澡就睡过去了
<4-8,Joey>Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
<4-8,Joey>现在没时间了
<4-8,Joey>and now I don't have time!

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
<4-8,Joey>才十条街  跑过去还来得及
<4-8,Joey>It's just 10 blocks away. If I run, I can make it.

176
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,360
<4-9,Monica>跑十条街  那你不是更臭了吗
<4-9,Monica>Run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.

177
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,790
<4-10,Rachel>慢一点  不  快走吧
<4-10,Rachel>Slow down! No, keep moving.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,010
<4-11,Monica>昨晚怎么样啊
<4-11,Monica>How did it go with Joshua last night?

179
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,030
<4-12,Rachel>我没见到约书亚
<4-12,Rachel>Well, I didn't see Joshua.

180
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,280
<4-12,Rachel>但我照着一个女孩的脸给了一拳
<4-12,Rachel>But I did punch a girl in the face.

181
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,420
<4-14,Phoebe>-什么  -什么
<4-14,Phoebe>- What? - What?

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,090
<4-15,Rachel>昨晚真的很倒霉  大雨倾盆
<4-15,Rachel>The whole night was horrible. It was pouring down raining.

183
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,230
<4-15,Rachel>而到现场我却发现名单上没有瑞秋·格林
<4-15,Rachel>And when I got there, there was no Rachel Greene on the list.

184
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,160
<4-15,Rachel>但有一个瑞秋·格皮
<4-15,Rachel>But there was a Rachel Greep.

185
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,300
<4-16,Phoebe>那你见到她了吗
<4-16,Phoebe>So did you get to meet her?

186
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
<4-17,Rachel>根本没这个人
<4-17,Rachel>No. There is no Rachel Greep.

187
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
<4-17,Rachel>但有个女生听到了
<4-17,Rachel>But then, this other girl overheard us.

188
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,180
<4-17,Rachel>大叫"我就是瑞秋·格皮"
<4-17,Rachel>And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep! I'm Rachel Greep!"

189
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,610
<4-17,Rachel>结果门卫就让她进去了
<4-17,Rachel>And he let her right in.

190
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,770
<4-18,Monica>然后你就打了她的脸
<4-18,Monica>So you hit her in the face?

191
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,160
<4-19,Rachel>打不着了  她已经进去了
<4-19,Rachel>No, she was already in.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
<4-19,Rachel>可后来我身后一个五大三粗的婆娘
<4-19,Rachel>But then this big bitch behind me

193
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,480
<4-19,Rachel>要偷我的伞...
<4-19,Rachel>tried to steal my umbrella...

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,200
<4-19,Rachel>我就给了她点颜色瞧瞧
<4-19,Rachel>so I clocked her.

195
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,580
<4-19,Rachel>真是的  我只想在工作之余
<4-19,Rachel>I can't believe this. All I wanted was just a few hours...

196
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,820
<4-19,Rachel>跟约书亚相处一下
<4-19,Rachel>outside of work to see Joshua...

197
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,740
<4-19,Rachel>好让他有机会爱上我
<4-19,Rachel>so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.

198
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,280
<4-20,Phoebe>菲
<4-20,Phoebe>Pheebs.

199
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,410
<4-21,Rachel>那是你的名字
<4-21,Rachel>Honey, that's your name.

200
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,080
<4-22,Phoebe>原来这是菲比的简称啊
<4-22,Phoebe>That's short for Phoebe?

201
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,850
<4-22,Phoebe>我以为那是我们之间的爱称
<4-22,Phoebe>I thought that's what we called each other.

202
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,690
<4-23,Monica>-你穿上裤子了  -没错
<4-23,Monica>- You're wearing pants! - That's right.

203
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,570
<4-24,Chandler>我那几位兄弟呢
<4-24,Chandler>Where are the guys?

204
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,290
<4-24,Chandler>我准备好借酒消愁和看脱衣舞了
<4-24,Chandler>I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.

205
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,140
<4-25,Monica>才早上9点半
<4-25,Monica>It's 9:30 in the morning.

206
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,560
<4-26,Chandler>那里的早餐是自助式的
<4-26,Chandler>They got a breakfast buffet.

207
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,650
<4-27,Monica>你好  是罗斯啊
<4-27,Monica>Hello. Oh, hey, Ross!

208
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,670
<4-28,Chandler>让我和他说
<4-28,Chandler>Let me talk to him!

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,330
<4-30,Chandler>-天哪  -我能不能...
<4-30,Chandler>- Oh, my God! - Can't I just...?

210
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,450
<4-31,Monica>等等  你说什么
<4-31,Monica>Wait, what?

211
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,200
<4-32,Chandler>她嘘我  那是我的电话  她还嘘我
<4-32,Chandler>She shushs me. It's my phone and she's shush...

212
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,750
<4-32,Chandler>别吵
<4-32,Chandler>Please!

213
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,960
<4-33,Phoebe>他说什么
<4-33,Phoebe>What's he saying?

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,310
<4-34,Monica>他跟艾蜜莉投宿在佛蒙特  在一起吃早餐呢
<4-34,Monica>He's with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!

215
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,820
<4-35,Phoebe>什么  天哪
<4-35,Phoebe>What? Oh, my God!

216
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,220
<4-36,Rachel>艾蜜莉是谁  不会吧
<4-36,Rachel>Who the hell is Emily...? No.

217
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,790
<5-1,Rachel>他们在佛蒙特  怎么会
<5-1,Rachel>They're in Vermont? How was this happen?

218
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,820
<5-3,Rachel>他怎么会跟那个丑巫婆去佛蒙特
<5-3,Rachel>How...how did he end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!

219
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,120
<5-4,Chandler>也许因为她没有一直打他吧
<5-4,Chandler>Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.

220
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,530
<6-1,Ross>罗斯  快来
<6-1,Ross>Ross, come quickly.

221
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,050
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

222
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,720
<6-2,Emily>我要挂了
<6-2,Emily>I got to go!

223
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,970
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,430
<6-4,Monica>他挂了
<6-4,Monica>He had to go.

225
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,590
<6-2,Emily>外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果
<6-2,Emily>There was a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.

226
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,340
<6-5,Rachel>我真不理解  她那么难看
<6-5,Rachel>I don't get this. She was horrible!

227
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,830
<6-6,Chandler>我站到那边去好了
<6-6,Chandler>I'm going to go stand over there.

228
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,680
<6-7,Monica>你干嘛这么在乎
<6-7,Monica>Why do you care so much anyway?

229
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,060
<6-7,Monica>我才不在乎
<6-7,Monica>I don't care.

230
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,670
<6-8,Rachel>我只是因为自己跟约书亚没进展而懊恼
<6-8,Rachel>I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

231
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,110
<6-8,Rachel>但怎么也不应该刚一认识
<6-8,Rachel>You know what, still, you do not just meet someone

232
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,920
<6-8,Rachel>就一起跑去佛蒙特啊
<6-8,Rachel>and go flitting off to Vermont!

233
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,670
<6-9,Monica>你和贝利不是刚一认识就跑去维尔了吗
<6-9,Monica>When you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.

<7-12,The A.D>不可能
<7-12,The A.D>There's no way he smells.

267
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,940
<7-12,The A.D>只有他的休息室里有浴室
<7-12,The A.D>He's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.

<7-13,Joey>And...which room might that be?

270
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,140
<7-14,The A.D>门口写着"赫斯顿"的那间
<7-14,The A.D>The one with "Heston" on it.

276
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,900
<8-4,The Cigarette Smoking Guy>也许你和你的孩子应该去别家脱衣舞俱乐部
<8-4,The Cigarette Smoking Guy>Maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.

277
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,030
<8-5,Phoebe>这才不是我的孩子
<8-5,Phoebe>It's not my baby.

282
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,100
<8-8,Rachel>我没出现在现场  他会担心呢
<8-8,Rachel>not showing up in his club.

283
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,120
<8-8,Rachel>更糟的是

<10-13,Phoebe>如果你肯一吐为快  或许就没事了
<10-13,Phoebe>Maybe it just would really, really help if you would just talk.
