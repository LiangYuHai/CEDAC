<2-6,Phoebe>宝宝想吃红肠  我却不能吃肉
<2-6,Phoebe>The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!

<3-7,Ross>我们去参观了维多利亚时期门把手展
<3-7,Ross>We went to see a collection ofvictorian doorknobs at the museum.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
<3-8,Chandler>居然不带我去
<3-8,Chandler>Without me?

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
<3-9,Emily>是我叔叔硬拖我们去的
<3-9,Emily>My uncle dragged us there,

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,460
<3-9,Emily>不过其实展览还挺有意思的
<3-9,Emily>But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,870

<3-11,Emily>They were so ornate and beautiful. Look at that.

<3-12,Monica>我不知道英国博物馆是怎么个规矩
<3-12,Monica>I don't know how museums work in England,

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,330
<3-12,Monica>但在我们这里  顺手牵羊是不对的
<3-12,Monica>but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,960
<3-13,Emily>这是从礼品店搞来的
<3-13,Emily>I got it from the gift shop.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,460
<3-13,Emily>那里的安保太松懈了
<3-13,Emily>They have really lax security.

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,370
<3-13,Emily>开玩笑的
<3-13,Emily>It's a joke.

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,810
<3-17,Ross>我甚至还报了直升机驾驶课
<3-17,Ross>I even signed up for helicopter classes.

62
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,510
<3-17,Ross>她过两天就走了  我不必真学
<3-17,Ross>She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.

<3-18,Monica>In two days? You must be bummed.

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,500
<3-19,Ross>她非回去不可  不过我开始就有心理准备
<3-19,Ross>She's got to go back, but I've been prepared for this from the start.

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,110
<3-19,Ross>我们都知道只有两周能在一起  仅此而已
<3-19,Ross>We knew we had two weeks together and then that's it.

66
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,360
<3-20,Joey>我的每段恋情都这样
<3-20,Joey>That's what all my relationships are like.

67
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,130
<3-21,Chandler>但在罗斯的恋情中
<3-21,Chandler>But in Ross' case,

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,210
<3-21,Chandler>"双方"都知道只有二个星期
<3-21,Chandler>they both know two weeks, that's it.

69

71
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,390
<3-25,Phoebe>宝宝想吃肉想疯了
<3-25,Phoebe>The baby is totally craving meat.

72
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,170
<3-25,Phoebe>我下午想用素肉堡骗他
<3-25,Phoebe>This afternoon, I made it a soy burger,

73
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,020
<3-25,Phoebe>让他以为自己吃到了肉
<3-25,Phoebe>so that it'd think it was getting meat.

74
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,450
<3-25,Phoebe>结果我就反胃了
<3-25,Phoebe>And I got nauseous.

75
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,850
<3-26,Chandler>也许是因为素肉堡巨难吃无比
<3-26,Chandler>Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!

76
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,000
<3-27,Phoebe>怀孕可把我的胃害惨了
<3-27,Phoebe>Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,130
<3-28,Joey>但你身上有一种孕妇的光彩
<3-28,Joey>But you got that cool pregnant-lady glow.

78
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,590
<3-29,Phoebe>那是汗  你要是吐一早上  也会有这样光彩的
<3-29,Phoebe>That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,940
<4-2,Rachel>-这是你要的风衣  -太棒了
<4-2,Rachel>- Here's that trench coat you wanted. - Great.

81
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,320
<4-5,Joshua>这下我就可以出去当暴露狂了
<4-5,Joshua>You could really flash somebody in this.

82
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,870
<4-6,Rachel>不行  不行  出了店门
<4-6,Rachel>Don't put your hands in the pockets

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,840
<4-6,Rachel>才能把手放进口袋里
<4-6,Rachel>until you are out of the store.

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,320
<4-7,Joshua>为什么不行
<4-7,Joshua>Why not?

85
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,820
<4-8,Rachel>因为...

<4-8,Rachel>有很多人...
<4-8,Rachel>...we get a lot of--

87
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,080
<4-9,Joshua>他们真是害群之马
<4-9,Joshua>They ruin it for everybody.

88
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,230
<4-10,Rachel>没错
<4-10,Rachel>I know.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,260
<4-11,Joshua>我昨晚穿着那件羊毛衫去约了个会
<4-11,Joshua>Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.

90
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,500
<4-13,Joshua>我离婚后的第一次约会
<4-13,Joshua>It was the first date since the divorce.

91
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,480
<4-14,Rachel>恭喜  你爱她吗
<4-14,Rachel>Congratulations. So do you love her?

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,810
<4-15,Joshua>她还不错  不过这也让我发现
<4-15,Joshua>She's nice, but it made me realize...

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,000
<4-15,Joshua>我其实还没有心情约会
<4-15,Joshua>...I'm just not ready to be dating.

94
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,130
<4-16,Rachel>有点意思
<4-16,Rachel>That's interesting.

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,610
<4-17,Joshua>-那是什么  -防盗磁条
<4-17,Joshua>-What was that? -Just an anti-theft device.

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,130
<4-19,Joshua>那这是什么
<4-19,Joshua>And what's this?

97
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,650
<4-20,Rachel>这个和这个  你都需要的
<4-20,Rachel>You need that, you need that too

98
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,890
<4-20,Rachel>因为很明显  贼会把它给撕掉的
<4-20,Rachel>cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,290
<5-1,Rachel>今晚开派对
<5-1,Rachel>Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight!

<5-1,Rachel>事实上派对五分钟后就开始
<5-1,Rachel>Actually, we have to have one in five minutes,

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,260
<5-1,Rachel>有事的快取消
<5-1,Rachel>so everybody cancel your plans.

102

<5-2,Chandler>-什么情况  -怎么了
<5-2,Chandler>- What are you talking about? - What's going on?

<5-4,Rachel>我们要给艾蜜莉办"惊喜欢送会"
<5-4,Rachel>We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily.

104
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,370
<5-4,Rachel>但其实是为了约书亚
<5-4,Rachel>But it's actually for Joshua.

105
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,190
<5-4,Rachel>他说  他还没有心情约会
<5-4,Rachel>He said he's not ready to date.

106
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,140
<5-4,Rachel>所以  我不得不邀请他参加派对
<5-4,Rachel>So I had to invite him to a party

107
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,910
<5-4,Rachel>这样我才能在工作之外见到他
<5-4,Rachel>if I wanted to see him outside of work.

108
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,300
<5-4,Rachel>现在我制造了一个色诱他的完美机会
<5-4,Rachel>And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

109
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,140
<5-5,Ross>虽然我很想当面警告约书亚
<5-5,Ross>As much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him. . .

110
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,830
<5-5,Ross>但我和艾蜜莉不会参加派对
<5-5,Ross>Emily and I won't be here.

111
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,080
<5-5,Ross>她会先来和大家道别
<5-5,Ross>She'll come by to say goodbye.

112
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,560
<5-5,Ross>然后我已经安排了整晚的节日
<5-5,Ross>I've got a special evening planned.

113
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,400
<5-5,Ross>抱歉  没有派对了

<5-10,Emily>No one's thrown me a surprise party before.

118
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,810
<5-11,Rachel>其实  这都是罗斯的主意

<10-2,Phoebe>好点了  但我付出的代价呢
<10-2,Phoebe>Yeah, but at what cost?

211
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,150
<10-2,Phoebe>三餐吃肉吃半年
<10-2,Phoebe>Six months, three meals a day?

<10-5,Joey>-什么  -我很能吃肉对吧
<10-5,Joey>- What? - I eat a lot of meat, right?

215
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,030
<10-6,Phoebe>要是在宝宝出生前  我戒吃肉
<10-6,Phoebe>But suppose, until the baby's born, I laid off it.

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,930
<10-7,Joey>这样就不会多死动物了
<10-7,Joey>No extra animals would die.

217
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,570
<10-7,Joey>你只是在吃我那份
<10-7,Joey>You'd just be eating my animals.

218
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,580
<10-8,Phoebe>真不敢想信  你愿意为我这么做

<10-9,Joey>啤酒里没有肉吧
<10-9,Joey>There's no meat in beer, right?

221
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,340
<11-1,Ross>如果不吃开胃菜   马上买单
<11-1,Ross>We can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers

222
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,130
<11-1,Ross>兴许我们还赶得上吃主菜
<11-1,Ross>and ask for our check right away.

223
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,290
<11-2,Emily>我们现在不能走  瑞秋要表演了

<11-4,Rachel>我的幸运裙效果不佳
<11-4,Rachel>My lucky dress wasn't working too well for me.

227

<11-4,Rachel>但四年来  这套衣服百发百中
<11-4,Rachel>But for four years, this baby never missed.

<13-2,Rachel>A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

258
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,390
<13-2,Rachel>要是墙壁会说话  它们一定会说
<13-2,Rachel>If these walls could talk, they'd say:

259
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,810
<13-2,Rachel>想听听往事吗
<13-2,Rachel>"Want to hear some memories?"

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,590
<13-6,Rachel>算了  真是的
<13-6,Rachel>God! Forget it!

264
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,380
<13-6,Rachel>事情不该是这样的
<13-6,Rachel>This is not how this was supposed to happen.

265
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,860
<13-7,Joshua>不然应该怎样
<13-7,Joshua>What was supposed to happen?

266
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,620
<13-8,Rachel>你能不能不要看我
<13-8,Rachel>Can you not look at me when I say this?

267
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,330
<13-8,Rachel>我原以为要是能把你叫来...
<13-8,Rachel>I thought that if I could get you here...

268
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,470
<13-8,Rachel>就能色诱你
<13-8,Rachel>I could seduce you.

269
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,710
<13-9,Joshua>我上班从不穿西装
<13-9,Joshua>I don't wear suits to work.

270
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,270
<13-9,Joshua>却跟你买了六套
<13-9,Joshua>And I bought six of them from you.

271
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,820
<13-10,Rachel>抱歉  我还以为你有需要
<13-10,Rachel>I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.

272
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,040
<13-11,Joshua>我的意思是我一直去找你
<13-11,Joshua>My point is, I kept coming back

273
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,320
<13-11,Joshua>是因为我想见你
<13-11,Joshua>because I wanted to see you.

274
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,200
<13-12,Rachel>为什么
<13-12,Rachel>Why?

275
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,780
<13-13,Joshua>因为我喜欢你

<13-15,Joshua>是啊  你漂亮  聪明又成熟
<13-15,Joshua>I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.

278
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,400
<13-15,Joshua>当然今晚我是没看到啦
<13-15,Joshua>A lot of this isn't based on tonight.

279
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,710
<13-14,Rachel>但是你喜欢我
<13-14,Rachel>But you like me?

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,970
<13-16,Rachel>这段日子以来  我们竟然一直互相喜欢
<13-16,Rachel>I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me!

281
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,640
<13-17,Joshua>不要说"但是"
<13-17,Joshua>No "but. "

282
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,050
<13-18,Rachel>"但是"都没好事  停在"我们互相喜欢"就好
<13-18,Rachel>"But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me. "

283
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,560
<13-20,Rachel>-然而  -那是个好听的"但是"
<13-20,Rachel>- However. - No, that's a fancy "but. "

284
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,850
<13-21,Joshua>我刚结束我的婚姻
<13-21,Joshua>My marriage, like, just ended.

285
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,530
<13-21,Joshua>我还没心情跟别人交住
<13-21,Joshua>And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.

286
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,420
<13-22,Rachel>但是...
<13-22,Rachel>But...

287
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,850
<13-23,Joshua>对不起  我需要一点时问
<13-23,Joshua>I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,220
<14-1,Rachel>你在这里  我还在找你呢
<14-1,Rachel>There you are. I was looking for you.

<14-1,Rachel>约书亚走了  你和艾蜜莉可以走了
<14-1,Rachel>Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.

290
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,900
<14-1,Rachel>无所谓了
<14-1,Rachel>It's okay.

291
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,440
<14-2,Ross>她还在里面享受这场假派对
<14-2,Ross>She's still in there enjoying her fake party.

292
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,890
<14-2,Ross>现在要做什么也来不及了
<14-2,Ross>It's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned.

293
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,640
<14-3,Rachel>罗斯  抱歉  我毁了你美好的夜晚
<14-3,Rachel>Ross. I'm sorry. I ruined your evening.

294
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,820
<14-5,Rachel>我出了个大丑
<14-5,Rachel>If it makes you feel any better,

295
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,870
<14-5,Rachel>这有没有让你高兴一点
<14-5,Rachel>I made a fool of myself.

296
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,570
<14-6,Ross>有一点点
<14-6,Ross>Helps a little.

297
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,210
<14-7,Rachel>能让悲惨的失败者坐下来吗
<14-7,Rachel>Is there room there for a pathetic loser?

298
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,730
<14-8,Ross>坐吧
<14-8,Ross>Have a seat.

300
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,270
<14-9,Rachel>没关系
<14-9,Rachel>It's okay.

301
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,010
<14-10,Ross>反正只是一段两周的恋情
<14-10,Ross>It was just a two-week thing anyway.

302
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,890
<14-10,Ross>我只是不想就这样结束
<14-10,Ross>I just didn't want it to end this way.

303
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,930
<14-11,Rachel>或许是你不想结束
<14-11,Rachel>Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

304
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,400
<14-12,Ross>什么意思
<14-12,Ross>What do you mean?

305
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,070
<14-13,Rachel>你似乎真的很喜欢她
<14-13,Rachel>You seem to really like her.

306
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,260
<14-14,Ross>没错
<14-14,Ross>I really do.

307
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,930
<14-14,Ross>但我能怎么办  我们说好
<14-14,Ross>What am I going to do? We agreed

308
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,030
<14-14,Ross>只在一起待两周的
<14-14,Ross>it'd be a two-week thing.

309
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,500
<14-14,Ross>不对彼此承诺什么
<14-14,Ross>No commitment.

310
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,580
<14-15,Rachel>那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友嚷嚷着
<14-15,Rachel>That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends. . .

311
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,500
<14-15,Rachel>说是要听你的故事

<14-15,Rachel>只想二周的话  鬼才会这么做呢
<14-15,Rachel>You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

314
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,200
<14-16,Ross>是吗
<14-16,Ross>You think?
