1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,070
<1-1,Chandler>老实说  似乎短短几个星期
<1-1,Chandler>You know what? It seems like all of the sudden;

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,800
<1-1,Chandler>发生了那么多
<1-1,Chandler>so much has happened.

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,270
<1-2,Joey>就是啊  罗斯要结婚了
<1-2,Joey>I know. Ross is getting married.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,630

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,170
<1-4,Joey>-大家都在忙  -只有我们坐在这里
<1-4,Joey>- Everybody's doing stuff. - We just sit here.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,140
<1-5,Chandler>要是我死了
<1-5,Chandler>I mean if I die

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-5,Chandler>我来过这里的唯一证据
<1-5,Chandler>the only way people would even know I was here,

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,320
<1-5,Chandler>就是这张椅子上的屁股印
<1-5,Chandler>would be by the ass print on this chair!

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,390
<1-5,Chandler>我们得做件大事  惊天动地的大事
<1-5,Chandler>Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,000
<1-6,Joey>我们可以去爬珠穆朗玛峰
<1-6,Joey>We could climb Mt. Everest.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,000
<1-7,Chandler>不是落人笑柄  是惊天动地
<1-7,Chandler>No-no, not something stupid, something huge.

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,400
<1-8,Joey>不  不  我看到一则录影带的广告
<1-8,Joey>No, no. I saw an ad for this video,

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,280
<1-8,Joey>每天都有人在爬  我们也可以爬
<1-8,Joey>people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,650
<1-9,Chandler>谁说不行  不过是爬山而已
<1-9,Chandler>Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing!

15
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,780
<1-9,Chandler>-不过是陡峭了点  -是啊
<1-9,Chandler>- It's just steep! - Yeah.

<1-10,Joey>我们就去爬珠穆朗玛峰
<1-10,Joey>We're going to Everest!

17
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,390
<1-11,Chandler>在山顶上留屁股印一定很赞
<1-11,Chandler>Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!

18
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,130
<1-14,Phoebe>你们在干嘛呢
<1-14,Phoebe>What's up?

00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,240
<1-16,Chandler>真的吗  我详细查过
<1-16,Chandler>Really? I looked into that.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-17,Phoebe>登珠峰要花六万块  而且可能会死
<1-17,Phoebe>Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and you know you can die.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,950
<1-17,Phoebe>你俩一定会死
<1-17,Phoebe>And you would die.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,060
<1-19,Joey>我们可以去租珠穆朗玛峰的录影带
<1-19,Joey>We could get that Everest video, though.

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,410
<1-20,Chandler>那样就不必冒生命危险了
<1-20,Chandler>Yeah, we could do that without risking our lives at all.

25
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,050
<1-21,Joey>等到了录影带店
<1-21,Joey>While we're at the video store,

<1-21,Joey>那盘录影带只能邮购
<1-21,Joey>That Everest thing is only available through mail order.

30
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,570
<1-23,Phoebe>-所以你们要留下来陪我咯  -是啊
<1-23,Phoebe>- So you'll stay here and hang out with me? - Yeah.

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,650
<1-26,Chandler>不过总有一天
<1-26,Chandler>But I'll tell you something, one of these days

32
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,490
<1-26,Chandler>我们要拍拍屁股站起来
<1-26,Chandler>we'll get off our butts

33

<1-26,Chandler>再去租一次《虎胆龙威》
<1-26,Chandler>and rent Die Hard again!

49
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,890
<2-1,Emily>决定了吗
<2-1,Emily>So what did we decide?

50
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-1,Emily>请不请你的纳森叔叔
<2-1,Emily>Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,370
<2-1,Emily>天啊  没有人喜欢他
<2-1,Emily>Oh, God! Nobody likes him.

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,380
<2-2,Ross>他好小器  他绝不会飞去伦敦的
<2-2,Ross>He's so cheap. He'd never fly to London in a million years.

53
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,540
<2-2,Ross>好  请吧
<2-2,Ross>Invite him!

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,740
<2-2,Ross>我的字写得还可以吗
<2-2,Ross>Did I do these neat enough?

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,300
<2-3,Emily>挺不错的
<2-3,Emily>Yeah, they're fine.

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,460
<2-5,Emily>别人问起来  我们就说是本写的
<2-5,Emily>If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them.

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,320
<2-5,Emily>你还请了瑞秋
<2-5,Emily>So you invited Rachel then?

58
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,750
<2-6,Ross>对啊  干嘛不请
<2-6,Ross>Sure, why not?

59
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,150
<2-7,Emily>真的吗
<2-7,Emily>Really?

60
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,880
<2-9,Emily>如果邀请我的旧情人  我会觉得很别扭
<2-9,Emily>I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.

61
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,720
<2-10,Ross>你觉得我们不该请她吗
<2-10,Ross>Wait, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?

62
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,340
<2-11,Emily>不  罗斯  我很喜欢瑞秋
<2-11,Emily>Oh, no-no, Ross, you know I absolutely adore Rachel.

63
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,900
<2-11,Emily>我只是...怕你会尴尬
<2-11,Emily>It's just that I thought it might be awkward for you.

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,540
<2-11,Emily>不过这完全由你来决定
<2-11,Emily>But it's absolutely your decision.

<9-4,Rachel>重点是我现在不需要这份感情
<9-4,Rachel>The point is I don't need this right now.

<12-1,Rachel>罗斯你知道吗  这是我生平第一次
<12-1,Rachel>Ross, do you realize this is the first time in my life

130
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,390
<12-1,Rachel>做自己喜欢的事情
<12-1,Rachel>I'm doing something I actually care about?

131
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,860
<12-1,Rachel>这是我生平第一次
<12-1,Rachel>This is the first time in my life

<12-1,Rachel>I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,370
<12-1,Rachel>要是你不懂...
<12-1,Rachel>If you don't get that...

134
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,550
<12-2,Ross>不  我懂  我非常懂
<12-2,Ross>No, I get that, okay, I get that big time.

135
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,910
<12-2,Ross>我替你高兴
<12-2,Ross>And I'm happy for you, but I'm tired of

136
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,220
<12-2,Ross>但我不想再跟你的答录机交往了
<12-2,Ross>having a relationship with your answering machine, okay?

137
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,280
<12-2,Ross>我已经没辙了
<12-2,Ross>I don't know what to do anymore.

138
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,420
<12-3,Rachel>我也是
<12-3,Rachel>Neither do I!

139
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,040
<12-4,Ross>这跟马克有关吗
<12-4,Ross>Is this about Mark?

140
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,070
<12-5,Rachel>我的天啊
<12-5,Rachel>Oh, my God!

141
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,000
<12-5,Rachel>-好  看来不是  -天啊
<12-5,Rachel>- Okay, it's not. - Oh, my god!

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,020
<12-7,Rachel>我不能为了同一件事跟你一吵再吵
<12-7,Rachel>I can't keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.

143
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,580
<12-8,Ross>你快把我逼疯了
<12-8,Ross>You're making this too hard!

144
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,270
<12-8,Ross>我逼你  那你要我怎么做
<12-8,Ross>I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do?

145
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,850
<12-8,Ross>我不知道
<12-8,Ross>I don't know. I don't know.

146
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,420
<12-9,Rachel>也许我们应该分开
<12-9,Rachel>Look, maybe we should just take a break.

147
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,420
<12-10,Ross>你说得对  我们先冷静一下
<12-10,Ross>You're right. Let's take a break. Let's cool off.

148
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,800
<12-10,Ross>去吃点酸奶冰淇淋什么的
<12-10,Ross>Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.

149
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,460
<12-10,Ross>不是
<12-10,Ross>No.

150
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,410
<12-11,Rachel>我是说分手
<12-11,Rachel>A break from us.

151
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,890
<13-1,Chloe>干嘛这么着急啊
<13-1,Chloe>Do I know why are we rushing?

152
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,320
<13-2,Ross>我昨晚提到的那个女朋友
<13-2,Ross>The girlfriend I told you about last night.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,740
<13-2,Ross>她想跟我复合
<13-2,Ross>She wants to get back together with me.

<14-5,Rachel>So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?

<14-6,Ross>可以得不得了
<14-6,Ross>Yes, you can very much.

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,330

<15-1,Rachel>I want you to leave. Get out of here! Just get out!

162

<15-4,Ross>不  我想留下来谈一谈
<15-4,Ross>No, I wanna stay. I want to talk about this.

163
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,160
<15-5,Rachel>好  她怎么样
<15-5,Rachel>All right, how was she?

<15-5,Rachel>-什么  -她活好吗
<15-5,Rachel>- What? - Was she good?

165
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,130
<15-5,Rachel>不要回答
<15-5,Rachel>Don't answer that!

166
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,480
<15-5,Rachel>来嘛  罗斯  你说你想谈
<15-5,Rachel>Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it,

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,230
<15-5,Rachel>那就谈啊  她怎么样
<15-5,Rachel>let's talk about it!! How was she?

168
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,510
<15-5,Rachel>她...
<15-5,Rachel>She was...

169
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,000
<15-5,Rachel>-差劲  糟糕  -她很逊
<15-5,Rachel>- Awful! Horrible! - She was not good, not good.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,810
<15-5,Rachel>什么都比不上你
<15-5,Rachel>Nothing compared to you.

171
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,370
<15-5,Rachel>她感觉很不同
<15-5,Rachel>She was different.

172
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,210
<15-5,Rachel>比我好吗
<15-5,Rachel>Good different?

173
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,040
<15-5,Rachel>没有人喜欢改变
<15-5,Rachel>Nobody likes change.

174
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,830
<15-5,Rachel>别再说了
<15-5,Rachel>Just stop!

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
<15-5,Rachel>你这么坦然认错
<15-5,Rachel>The way you owned up to everything.

176
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,340
<15-5,Rachel>证明你真的成长了不少
<15-5,Rachel>It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know?

177
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,140
<15-5,Rachel>我妈一直觉得我们无法复合
<15-5,Rachel>I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.

178
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,650
<15-5,Rachel>她说  狗改不了吃屎
<15-5,Rachel>She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."

179
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,720
<24-1,Rachel>真希望没有这四个月的空白
<24-1,Rachel>I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.

180
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,640
<24-1,Rachel>但要是时间能让你认清错误
<24-1,Rachel>But if time was what you needed

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
<24-1,Rachel>那也不算浪费
<24-1,Rachel>just to gain a little perspective.

182
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,470
<24-2,Ross>我们当时分手了
<24-2,Ross>We were on a break!

184
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,820
<25-1,Rachel>你似乎真的很喜欢她
<25-1,Rachel>You seem to really like her.

185
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,120
<25-2,Ross>我能怎么办  我们说好只在一起两周
<25-2,Ross>What do I do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.

186
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,510
<25-2,Ross>不做承诺
<25-2,Ross>No commitment.

187
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,900
<25-3,Rachel>罗斯  那个女孩整晚都在
<25-3,Rachel>Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,520
<25-3,Rachel>和你朋友聊天
<25-3,Rachel>talking to your friends

189
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,560
<25-3,Rachel>嚷着要听你的事
<25-3,Rachel>asking to hear stories about you

190
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,180
<25-3,Rachel>还看莫妮卡的相簿
<25-3,Rachel>looking through Monica's photo albums.

191
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,840
<25-3,Rachel>只想在一起两周才不会这样
<25-3,Rachel>You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

192
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,840
<25-4,Ross>是吗
<25-4,Ross>You think?

193
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,160
<25-5,Rachel>她还有14个小时才去机场
<25-5,Rachel>You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.

194
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,590
<25-5,Rachel>你却坐在走廊上
<25-5,Rachel>And you're sitting here in a hallway

195
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,960
<25-5,Rachel>陪一个香肠嘴的大龄啦啦队长
<25-5,Rachel>with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,890
<25-5,Rachel>-你说得对  -是啊
<25-5,Rachel>- You're right. - Yeah.

<26-1,Monica>This is so amazing!

198
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,280
<26-1,Monica>我哥哥居然要去伦敦结婚
<26-1,Monica>Can't believe my brother's getting married and in London!

<26-2,Joey>You're at the wedding. You have to cry.

203
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,280
<26-2,Joey>需要手帕吗  不了  我有喜帖
<26-2,Joey>Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.

<26-13,Joey>So I didn't know that. But you should see your faces.

216
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,010
<26-14,Rachel>你们在干嘛
<26-14,Rachel>Hey, guys. What's up?

<26-17,Rachel>What's this? Ross' wedding invitation?

219
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,620
<26-18,Chandler>我们该藏的是那一张
<26-18,Chandler>Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.

220
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,060
<26-19,Rachel>不  伙计们  你们不必这样
<26-19,Rachel>No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,490
<26-24,Chandler>该不会是她不去  我们就不去了吧
<26-24,Chandler>This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?

228
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,560
<26-24,Chandler>我已经买好机票了
<26-24,Chandler>Because I've already bought my ticket.

<26-25,Monica>You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.

<27-1,Rachel>- Who's this from? - That's Ross'.

<27-4,Phoebe>记得什么
<27-4,Phoebe>Remembered what?

235
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,240
<27-5,Rachel>好几个月前  我们经过一家古董店
<27-5,Rachel>It was months ago. We were walking by this antique store.

236
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,040
<27-5,Rachel>我看到这个别针
<27-5,Rachel>and I saw this pin in the window,

237

00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,860
<43-13,Monica>你真的不去吗
<43-13,Monica>You're really not going?

350
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,160
<43-13,Monica>我会很难面对
<43-13,Monica>It's just going to be too hard.

<40-3,Monica>It's just for the best. You know? It is.

355
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,440
<43-14,Rachel>而且总得有人陪菲比
<43-14,Rachel>Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.

356
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,970
<43-14,Rachel>到时她的肚子就会很大了
<43-14,Rachel>She's going to be pretty big by then.

357
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,230
<43-14,Rachel>她会需要别人绑鞋带
<43-14,Rachel>She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.

<43-16,Rachel>事情那么多  时间却那么少
<43-16,Rachel>There's so much to do, and I have so little time to do it in!
