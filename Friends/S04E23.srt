<6-9,Monica>would be more elegant than chicken.

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,510

132
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,660
<7-5,Monica>好吧  我问了一个拿铁锹的哥们儿
<7-5,Monica>Okay. I talked to a guy with a shovel,

133
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,570
<7-5,Monica>知道怎么回事了
<7-5,Monica>and I found out what happened.

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,120
<7-7,Monica>拆除提前进行了
<7-7,Monica>They tore it down a few days early.

136
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,570
<7-7,Monica>漂亮
<7-7,Monica>All right!

137
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,810
<8-1,Joey>西敏寺
<8-1,Joey>Westminster Abbey.

138
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,690
<8-1,Joey>我宣布  这绝对是我见过最美的教堂
<8-1,Joey>Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.

139
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,600
<8-1,Joey>你觉得西敏寺如何  钱德勒
<8-1,Joey>What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?

140
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,340
<8-2,Chandler>很漂亮  很漂亮
<8-2,Chandler>Yean, I think it's great! It's great.

141
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,260
<8-2,Chandler>不过  他们正打算改名
<8-2,Chandler>You know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.

142
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,150
<8-3,Joey>真的吗  改成什么
<8-3,Joey>Really? To what?

143
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,700
<8-4,Chandler>改成"把摄影机收起来"
<8-4,Chandler>To "Put the Camera Away"!

144
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,840
<8-5,Joey>你真是"西敏怒汉"
<8-5,Joey>Man, you are Westminster Crabby.

<9-3,Phoebe>拜托  我就是留下来照顾你的
<9-3,Phoebe>Come on. I'm here to take care of you.

148

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,180
<9-6,Rachel>好吧  真有你的风格
<9-6,Rachel>Okay, that is all you.

151
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,310
<9-7,Phoebe>你中午想吃什么
<9-7,Phoebe>What do you want for lunch?

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
<9-7,Phoebe>我不知道
<9-7,Phoebe>Oh, I don't know.

153
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,490
<9-8,Rachel>我们是得吃饭
<9-8,Rachel>I guess we have to eat.

154
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,820
<9-9,Phoebe>我一定要吃
<9-9,Phoebe>Yeah, I do.

155
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,320
<9-9,Phoebe>怎么了
<9-9,Phoebe>What's the matter?

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
<9-10,Rachel>我和罗斯之间的事弄得真差劲
<9-10,Rachel>I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross.

157
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,770
<9-10,Rachel>真后悔骗他说我要工作  他好像很气我
<9-10,Rachel>I wish I didn't lie about work. He seemed so mad at me.

158
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,170
<9-11,Phoebe>别太苛责自己
<9-11,Phoebe>Don't be so hard on yourself.

159
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,820
<9-11,Phoebe>如果我依然深爱着的人要结婚的话
<9-11,Phoebe>If someone I was still in love with was getting married--

160
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,100
<9-12,Rachel>依然深爱着的
<9-12,Rachel>Still in love with?

161
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,340
<9-14,Rachel>-对啊  -我才没有爱着罗斯
<9-14,Rachel>- Yeah. - I'm not in love with Ross.

162
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
<9-15,Phoebe>没有啊  很好
<9-15,Phoebe>No, no. Good!

163
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,690
<9-15,Phoebe>我也没有
<9-15,Phoebe>Yeah, me neither.

164
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,920
<9-15,Phoebe>菲比  我不去参加婚礼
<9-15,Phoebe>Phoebe, I'm not at the wedding

165
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,220
<9-16,Rachel>是因为他是我的前男友
<9-16,Rachel>because he's my ex-boyfriend

166
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,250
<9-16,Rachel>去了会很不自在
<9-16,Rachel>and that would be really uncomfortable.

167
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,310
<9-16,Rachel>不是因为我还爱他
<9-16,Rachel>Not because I'm in love with him.

168
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,820
<9-16,Rachel>我对他的感觉和其他人一样
<9-16,Rachel>I like Ross as much as next guy.

169
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,980
<9-16,Rachel>显然  我是对他有感觉
<9-16,Rachel>Clearly, I have feelings for him,

170
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,700
<9-16,Rachel>但那不是爱
<9-16,Rachel>but feelings don't mean love.

171
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,730
<9-16,Rachel>我对罗斯还有爱的感觉吗  有
<9-16,Rachel>I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!

172
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,990
<9-16,Rachel>我一直都有感觉
<9-16,Rachel>I have continuing feelings of love.

173
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,790
<9-16,Rachel>但那并不表示我还爱着他
<9-16,Rachel>But that doesn't mean I'm still in love with him.

174
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,350
<9-16,Rachel>我对他还有"性"趣  可我确实很爱他
<9-16,Rachel>I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.

175
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,420
<9-21,Phoebe>天呐
<9-21,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

176
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,890
<9-22,Rachel>你为什么不告诉我
<9-22,Rachel>Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,680
<9-17,Phoebe>-我们以为你知道  -你们
<9-17,Phoebe>- We thought you knew! - We?

178
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,340
<9-19,Phoebe>对  我们都知道  还经常在聊
<9-19,Phoebe>We all know. We talk about it all the time.

179
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,730
<9-20,Rachel>你们都知道  罗斯知道吗
<9-20,Rachel>You all know? Does Ross know?

180
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,950
<9-21,Phoebe>不  罗斯什么都不知道
<9-21,Phoebe>No! Ross doesn't know anything.

181
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,000
<9-22,Rachel>真不敢相信你们居然没告诉我
<9-22,Rachel>Cannot believe you didn't tell me!

182
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,920
<9-22,Rachel>因为我们以为你知道  那么明显
<9-22,Rachel>We thought you knew. It's so obvious!

183
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,860
<9-23,Phoebe>天啊  这就好比告诉莫妮卡
<9-23,Phoebe>God! It would be like telling Monica,

184
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,950
<9-23,Phoebe>"喂  你很爱干净哦"
<9-23,Phoebe>"Hey, you know, you like things clean."

185
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,570
<10-2,The Vendor>你们想买什么
<10-2,The Vendor>So what do you find in the market for?

186

<10-4,Chandler>that "I'm with a stupid" T-shirt anymore.

192
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,920
<10-6,Chandler>你不是真打算买的  对吧
<10-6,Chandler>You're not really buying that, are you?

193
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,090
<10-6,Chandler>你不觉得你今天已经让我够难堪了吗
<10-6,Chandler>Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?

194
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,560
<10-7,Joey>哦  我让你难堪了吗
<10-7,Joey>Oh, I embarrass you?

195
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,210
<10-8,Chandler>叫我怎么回答  我一直都在假装根本不认识你
<10-8,Chandler>How can I answer when I'm pretending I don't know you?

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,180
<10-9,The Vendor>他是在嫉妒  你戴着很好看
<10-9,The Vendor>He's just jealous. You fit it right.

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,680

<10-9,The Vendor>All Londoners wear them.

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,920
<10-10,Chandler>是吗  那这里怎么没人戴
<10-10,Chandler>Really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?

199
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,390
<10-11,The Vendor>他们都是观光客
<10-11,The Vendor>They're all tourists.

200
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,360
<10-12,Chandler>如果你要当街戴着那顶帽子
<10-12,Chandler>If you insist on wearing that in public,

201
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,560
<10-12,Chandler>下午你就自己去逛
<10-12,Chandler>you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself.

202
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,280
<10-13,Joey>如果你逼我在你和帽子之间做选择
<10-13,Joey>If you make me choose between you and the hat,

203
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,540
<10-13,Joey>我选择帽子
<10-13,Joey>I choose the hat.

204

<10-14,The Vendor>-够英明  -谢了
<10-14,The Vendor>- Good choice. - Thanks.

<10-16,Chandler>我要走了  我不想再丢脸了
<10-16,Chandler>I'm out of here. I'm not gonna be embarrassed any more.

207
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,670
<11-1,Emily>-有人吗  -嗨
<11-1,Emily>- Hello?  - Hey!

208
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,590
<11-2,Ross>我刚跟你爸谈过  你猜怎样
<11-2,Ross>I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?

209
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,670
<11-2,Ross>他好像觉得
<11-2,Ross>He seems to think

210
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,410
<11-2,Ross>我们可以重新找一个婚礼场地
<11-2,Ross>we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.

211
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,230
<11-4,Ross>-不必了  -你找到地方了吗
<11-4,Ross>- We don't have to. - You found a place?

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,560
<11-5,Emily>没有  但莫妮卡和我讨论过
<11-5,Emily>No, but Monica and I were talking

213
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,040
<11-5,Emily>我因为礼堂被拆的事很烦
<11-5,Emily>and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down

214
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,460
<11-5,Emily>然后她建议把婚礼推迟几天
<11-5,Emily>and she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit.

215
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,840
<11-6,Ross>她说什么
<11-6,Ross>She said what?

216
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,710
<11-7,Emily>她说如果我不满意在一个
<11-7,Emily>She said if I'm not gonna be happy getting married

217
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,160
<11-7,Emily>临时找到的地方结婚
<11-7,Emily>somewhere that we can find in a day,

218
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,050
<11-7,Emily>我们就应该延期
<11-7,Emily>well, then we should just postpone it.

219
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,380
<11-7,Emily>延期
<11-7,Emily>Postpone it.

220
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,080
<11-7,Emily>艾蜜莉  你觉得莫妮卡知道
<11-7,Emily>Emily, do you think Monica realizes

221
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,520
<11-8,Ross>我们爸妈为这场婚礼花了多少钱吗
<11-8,Ross>how much our parents spent on this wedding?

222
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,110
<11-8,Ross>你觉得我妹的小脑袋
<11-8,Ross>Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,030
<11-8,Ross>能理解大家特地挪出时间
<11-8,Ross>comprehends that people took time out of their lives

224
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,040
<11-8,Ross>不远千里坐飞机来这里吗
<11-8,Ross>to fly thousands of miles to be here?

225
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,110
<11-8,Ross>这么做是不对的
<11-8,Ross>This isn't right.

226
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,280
<11-9,Emily>我知道大家会失望
<11-9,Emily>I realize that people are gonna be disappointed.

227
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,040
<11-9,Emily>但等我们准备好了  他们一定会再来的
<11-9,Emily>But I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.

228
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,750
<11-10,Ross>我不能叫人家这么做  你会吗
<11-10,Ross>I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that?

229
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,800
<11-11,Emily>别拿你的裤子指着我
<11-11,Emily>Don't you point your pants at me!

230
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,160
<11-11,Emily>我们别无选择
<11-11,Emily>We have no choice.

231
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,230
<11-11,Emily>像样一点的场地
<11-11,Emily>Anywhere that's half-decent

232
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,990
<11-11,Emily>肯定在几个月前就被预定了
<11-11,Emily>will have been booked months ago.

233
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
<11-11,Emily>罗斯  你还不明白吗
<11-11,Emily>Ross, don't you understand?

234
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,840
<11-11,Emily>我现在在说的可是我们的婚礼啊
<11-11,Emily>This is our wedding I'm talking about!

235
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,180
<11-12,Ross>我只知道延期是不可能的
<11-12,Ross>The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option.

236
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,980
<11-12,Ross>我们只能现在结婚
<11-12,Ross>This is when we're getting married.

237
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,640
<11-13,Emily>那你现在什么意思  今天不结就拉到吗
<11-13,Emily>So what do you say? It's now or never?

238
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,240
<11-14,Ross>不对  我是说今天就结
<11-14,Ross>No, I'm saying it's now.

239
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,490
<11-15,Emily>-否则呢  -我没说否则
<11-15,Emily>- Or? - There's no "or" in mine!

240
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,910
<11-16,Ross>这条裤子是怎么搞的
<11-16,Ross>What is wrong with these pants?

241
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,890
<11-17,Emily>不是裤子  是你本末倒置
<11-17,Emily>It's not the pants. It's you who's backwards.

242
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,880
<11-17,Emily>要是你不懂这件事对我多重要
<11-17,Emily>If you don't understand how important this is to me,

243
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,340
<11-17,Emily>也许我们根本就不该结婚
<11-17,Emily>well, then, perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all!

244
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:04,100
<11-18,Ross>艾蜜莉  等一下  别走
<11-18,Ross>Emily, no! Wait, stop! Emily, please...

245
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,240
<12-3,Phoebe>购物有没有让你忘掉对罗斯的爱
<12-3,Phoebe>So...Did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?

246
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,330
<12-4,Rachel>曼哈顿的店不够多
<12-4,Rachel>Manattan doesn't have enough stores.

247
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,160
<12-5,Phoebe>我觉得我可以帮你忘了他
<12-5,Phoebe>I think I can help you get over him.

248
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,060
<12-6,Rachel>真的吗
<12-6,Rachel>You can?

249
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,180
<12-7,Phoebe>对  我需要你给我拿几张罗斯的照片
<12-7,Phoebe>Yeah, I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross

250
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,200
<12-9,Phoebe>一小块巧克力
<12-9,Phoebe>and a small piece of chocolate

251
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,340
<12-11,Phoebe>和一杯温水
<12-11,Phoebe>and a glass of tepid water.

252
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,150
<12-12,Rachel>是不是那种巫术啊
<12-12,Rachel>Oh, is this one of those things

253
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,330
<12-12,Rachel>你要把他的一些物件
<12-12,Rachel>where you throw a bunch of his stuff

254
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,960
<12-12,Rachel>跟墓地的土装在一个袋子里
<12-12,Rachel>in a bag with some graveyard dirt

255
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,790
<12-12,Rachel>然后挂在一棵面北的树上
<12-12,Rachel>and hang it on a north-facing tree?

256
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,630
<12-13,Phoebe>除非你也在打隔的话
<12-13,Phoebe>Only if you have the hiccups too.

257
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,240
<12-13,Phoebe>照片是给你的
<12-13,Phoebe>Yeah, the picures are for you.

258
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,590
<12-13,Phoebe>巧克力和水是给我的
<12-13,Phoebe>The chocolate and water is for me.

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,030
<12-13,Phoebe>我只是不想起来
<12-13,Phoebe>I just didn't feel like getting up.

260
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,720
<12-13,Phoebe>我要给你看一张罗斯的照片
<12-13,Phoebe>Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross, okay?

261
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,050
<12-13,Phoebe>而你要去回忆
<12-13,Phoebe>And you're going to remember

262
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,180
<12-13,Phoebe>他不好的地方  明白吗
<12-13,Phoebe>all the bad things about him, all right?

263
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,990
<12-14,Rachel>-专心想他的缺点  -没问题
<12-14,Rachel>- Really focus on his flaws. - I can do that.

264
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,750
<12-14,Rachel>我们交往时我就这么做过
<12-14,Rachel>Certainly I did that while we were going out.

265
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,140
<12-14,Rachel>在开始之前
<12-14,Rachel>Before we get started,

266
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,570
<12-15,Phoebe>我想先声明  我爱罗斯
<12-15,Phoebe>I just want to say, for the record, that I love Ross.

267
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,180
<12-15,Phoebe>我觉得他真的是个好小伙
<12-15,Phoebe>I think he is such a great guy.

268
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,540
<12-15,Phoebe>好  现在闭上眼睛
<12-15,Phoebe>Okay. Now, close your eyes.

269
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
<12-15,Phoebe>想像你跟罗斯在一起
<12-15,Phoebe>And imagine that you're with Ross.

270
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,230
<12-15,Phoebe>想像你在吻他
<12-15,Phoebe>Imagine that you're kissing him.

271
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,690
<12-15,Phoebe>你的手在他身上游走
<12-15,Phoebe>You're running your hands all over his body.

272
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,400
<12-15,Phoebe>你的手抚弄他的头发  但是
<12-15,Phoebe>You run your hands through his hair but...

273
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,620
<12-15,Phoebe>好恶心  是某种油
<12-15,Phoebe>Gross! It's some kind of grease.

274
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,950
<12-15,Phoebe>我不知道
<12-15,Phoebe>I don't know.

275
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,100
<12-16,Rachel>他的头发没那么招人烦
<12-16,Rachel>His hair never bothered me that much.

276
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,040
<12-16,Rachel>那应该算是硬而不是油
<12-16,Rachel>It was more crunchy than it was greasy.

277
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,240
<12-17,Phoebe>好吧  比我想得难多了
<12-17,Phoebe>This will be harder than I thought.

278
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,510
<12-17,Phoebe>试试"厌恶疗法"好了
<12-17,Phoebe>Let's try some aversion therapy.

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
<12-21,Phoebe>看着照片
<12-21,Phoebe>Look at the picture.

280
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,630
<13-1,Joey>现在觉得怎样
<13-1,Joey>How do you feel now?

281
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,270
<13-2,Chandler>我比较不喜欢你了
<13-2,Chandler>Well, I like you less.

282
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,200
<13-3,Joey>抱歉
<13-3,Joey>Sorry.

283
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,160
<13-4,Chandler>我才抱歉  我之前真不该说你丢我的脸
<13-4,Chandler>I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have said you were embarrassing me.

284
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,760
<13-4,Chandler>真的很过份
<13-4,Chandler>That really wasn't cool.

285
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,770
<13-4,Chandler>如果你会高兴一点  我今天过得很悲惨
<13-4,Chandler>And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.

286
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,250
<13-5,Joey>我也是
<13-5,Joey>Me too.

287
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,590
<13-6,Chandler>-真的吗  -才怪
<13-6,Chandler>- Yeah? - No!

288
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,920
<13-7,Joey>我玩得超过瘾的
<13-7,Joey>I had the best day ever!

289
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,850
<13-7,Joey>老兄  你来看
<13-7,Joey>Dude, check this out!

290
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,110
<14-1,Joey>跟我的朋友打个招呼
<14-1,Joey>So say hi to my friend,

291
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,660
<14-1,Joey>告诉他你喜欢我的帽子
<14-1,Joey>tell him you like my hat.

293
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,090
<14-2,Fergie>-好  你朋友叫什么名字  -钱德勒
<14-2,Fergie>- Okay. So what's your friend's name? - Chandler.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,060
<14-4,Fergie>钱德勒你好
<14-4,Fergie>Hi, Chandler.

295
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,780
<14-7,Joey>-那是  -那是小弗啦  宝贝
<14-7,Joey>- That's... - That's Fergie, baby!

296
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,280
<14-8,Fergie>乔伊说你不喜欢他的帽子
<14-8,Fergie>Joey says you don't really like his hat,

297
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,290
<14-8,Fergie>但我觉得蛮时鬃的
<14-8,Fergie>but I think it's kind of dashing.

298
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,650
<14-9,Chandler>你是怎么  你什么时候
<14-9,Chandler>How did you--when did you--

299
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,960
<14-10,Joey>我想搞清楚去白金汉宫的路
<14-10,Joey>I was trying to get to Buckingham Palace.

300
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,980
<14-10,Joey>所以我就走进地图  然后
<14-10,Joey>So I'm in my map and...

301
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,060
<14-12,Ross>听说你和艾蜜莉谈过
<14-12,Ross>I understand you had a little talk with Emily.

302
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,180
<14-13,Monica>没错
<14-13,Monica>Yes, I did.

303
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,530
<14-13,Monica>不用谢我
<14-13,Monica>And you are welcome.

304
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,580
<14-14,Ross>谢你
<14-14,Ross>Am I?

305
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,750
<14-14,Ross>是你提议把婚期延后的
<14-14,Ross>Was it your idea to postpone the wedding?

306
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,650
<14-16,Chandler>-我要上厕所  -等我
<14-16,Chandler>- I'm going to the bathroom. - Wait up!

307
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,080
<14-17,Joey>既然你这么会解决问题  问题来了
<14-17,Joey>Since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle:

308
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,650
<14-18,Ross>当新娘说她根本不想结婚时
<14-18,Ross>What do you do when the bride says

309
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,000
<14-18,Ross>你打算怎么办
<14-18,Ross>she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?

310
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,490
<14-19,Monica>-她这么说了吗  -对啊
<14-19,Monica>- She said that? - Yeah.

311
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,230
<14-20,Ross>为什么
<14-20,Ross>Why?

312
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,100
<14-21,Monica>不知道
<14-21,Monica>I don't know.

313
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,930
<14-22,Ross>我跟她说因为礼堂被拆而延期
<14-22,Ross>I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding

314
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,730
<14-22,Ross>是个蠢主意
<14-22,Ross>just because the hall was gone,

315
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,310
<14-22,Ross>她就被气跑了
<14-22,Ross>and she, like, flipped out.

316
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,520
<14-23,Monica>天呐  你比我还笨
<14-23,Monica>Oh, my God! You're even dumber than I am.

317
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,800
<14-24,Ross>什么
<14-24,Ross>Excuse me?

318
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,080
<14-25,Monica>你筹备这次婚礼多久了
<14-25,Monica>How long have you been planning this wedding?

319
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,390
<14-26,Ross>不好说  一个月吧
<14-26,Ross>I don't know. A month?

320
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,520
<14-27,Monica>艾蜜莉可能从五岁起就在计划了
<14-27,Monica>Emily's probably been planning it since she was 5.

321
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,850
<14-27,Monica>从她第一次拿来一个枕套
<14-27,Monica>Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase

322
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,630
<14-27,Monica>披在脑袋后面开始
<14-27,Monica>and hung it off the back of her head.

323
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,960
<14-27,Monica>我们女生都这样
<14-27,Monica>That's what we did.

324
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,080
<14-27,Monica>我们梦想办一场完美的婚礼
<14-27,Monica>We dreamed about the perfect wedding.

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,710
<14-27,Monica>在一个完美的场地
<14-27,Monica>In the perfect place.

326
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,140
<14-27,Monica>有一个完美的四层结婚蛋糕
<14-27,Monica>With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.

327
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,840
<14-27,Monica>上面有小人偶
<14-27,Monica>With the little people on top.

328
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,600
<14-27,Monica>但最重要的是
<14-27,Monica>But the most important part

329
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,380
<14-27,Monica>有个完美的男人
<14-27,Monica>is that we had the perfect guy

330
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,270
<14-27,Monica>而他正好了解这一切对我们有多重要
<14-27,Monica>who understood just how important all that other stuff was.

331
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,290
<14-28,Ross>我都不知道
<14-28,Ross>I had no idea.

332
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:08,120
<14-28,Ross>我以为你披枕头套是在模仿《快乐的修女》
<14-28,Ross>That pillowcase thing, I thought you were doing "The Flying Nun".

333
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,530
<14-29,Monica>有时候是啦
<14-29,Monica>Sometimes we were.

334
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,200
<14-29,Monica>别哭了
<14-29,Monica>Come on.

335
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,030
<14-30,Ross>你要帮我想想办法
<14-30,Ross>You're gonna help me figure out what to do.

336
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,430
<14-33,Chandler>-场面蛮紧张的  -是啊
<14-33,Chandler>- Pretty intense, huh? - Yeah.

337
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,010
<14-34,Joey>希望罗斯不会以为
<14-34,Joey>I hope Ross didn't think we just went in there

338
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,740
<14-34,Joey>我们是怕尴尬才进厕所的
<14-34,Joey>because we were uncomfortable being out here.

339
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,270
<14-35,Chandler>希望他就是这么想的
<14-35,Chandler>I hope he did.

340
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,790
<15-1,Phoebe>喂
<15-1,Phoebe>Hello!

341
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,340
<15-2,Joey>菲比  我是乔伊
<15-2,Joey>Hey, Phoebs, it's Joey.

342
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,680
<15-2,Joey>嘿  乔伊
<15-2,Joey>Hey, Joey!

343
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,960
<15-3,Phoebe>我在地铁看到一个很像你的人
<15-3,Phoebe>I saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
