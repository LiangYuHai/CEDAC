00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,770
<6-1,Rachel>嗨
<6-1,Rachel>Oh, hi.

129
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,770
<6-2,Ross>嗨
<6-2,Ross>Hi.

130
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,730
<6-3,Rachel>抱歉  事情竟然出了状况
<6-3,Rachel>I'm sorry things aren't working out so well.

131
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,730
<6-3,Rachel>不
<6-3,Rachel>No...

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,000
<6-4,Ross>的确不太妙  不过会解决的
<6-4,Ross>It could be better. It'll be okay, right?

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,300
<6-5,Rachel>当然了  她不会放在心上的
<6-5,Rachel>Oh, yeah! Of course. She's gonna get over this, you know.

134
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,620
<6-5,Rachel>你脱口说出我的名字又如何
<6-5,Rachel>I mean, so you said my name.

135
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,770
<6-5,Rachel>不过是因为你刚好看到我
<6-5,Rachel>You know you just said it because you saw me there.

136
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,610
<6-5,Rachel>如果你看到的是马戏团小丑  你就会说
<6-5,Rachel>If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said:

137
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,790
<6-5,Rachel>我娶你  马戏团小丑
<6-5,Rachel>"I take thee, circus Freak."

138
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,690
<6-5,Rachel>根本没有别的意思  只是无心之过
<6-5,Rachel>It didn't mean anything. It's a mistake.

139
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,260
<6-5,Rachel>没有别的意思  对吧
<6-5,Rachel>It didn't mean anything. Right?

140
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,360
<6-6,Ross>当然没有别的意思了
<6-6,Ross>Oh, no! Of course it didn't mean anything. I mean...

141
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,930
<6-6,Ross>但是我明白艾蜜莉为何误会
<6-6,Ross>I can understand why Emily would think it meant something...

142
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,400
<6-6,Ross>因为是你的名字
<6-6,Ross>You know... because it was you.

143
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,040
<6-8,Ross>但是没别的意思  真的没有
<6-8,Ross>But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't!

144
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,540
<6-9,Joey>罗斯  乐队正在等你跟艾蜜莉开舞
<6-9,Joey>Ross, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily.

145
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,480
<6-10,Ross>原来乐队准备好了
<6-10,Ross>Oh! The band's ready!

146
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,520
<6-10,Ross>我们最好听乐队的话
<6-10,Ross>We've got to do what the band says.

147
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,020
<6-10,Ross>我才不在乎什么傻瓜乐队呢
<6-10,Ross>I don't care about the stupid band!

148
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,090
<6-11,Joey>你口水喷到我了
<6-11,Joey>You spit on me, man!

149
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,890
<6-12,Ross>对不起
<6-12,Ross>I'm sorry.

150
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,200
<6-13,Joey>艾蜜莉也进去太久了吧
<6-13,Joey>Emily is taking kind of a long time.

151
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,590
<6-14,Rachel>我结婚时也躲在厕所不出来
<6-14,Rachel>You know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding...

152
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,070
<6-14,Rachel>那是因为我要撬开窗户
<6-14,Rachel>...because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.

153
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,820
<6-16,Rachel>我一心想要逃出去
<6-16,Rachel>Get the hell out of there. You know?

154
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,810
<6-16,Rachel>艾蜜莉  艾蜜莉
<6-16,Rachel>Emily! Emily!

155
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,340
<6-17,Ross>我要进去了
<6-17,Ross>I'm coming in!

156
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,750
<6-18,Rachel>你看  同一招
<6-18,Rachel>Oh, look at that. Same thing.

157
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,600
<7-1,Chandler>如果我中途大喊
<7-1,Chandler>Listen, in the middle of everything,

158
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,650
<7-1,Chandler>"好耶"  你就当作没听到
<7-1,Chandler>if I scream, "Yippee!" just ignore me.

159
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,900
<7-2,Monica>-天啊  瑞秋  -你好  瑞秋
<7-2,Monica>- Oh, my God! Rachel! - Oh, hello, Rachel.

160
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,840
<7-3,Chandler>罗斯说的是我的名字
<7-3,Chandler>Ross said my name.

161
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,570
<7-4,Rachel>知道吗  我的名字
<7-4,Rachel>Okay? My name!

162
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,640
<7-4,Rachel>他在婚礼上说出我的名字
<7-4,Rachel>Ross said my name up there.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,280
<7-4,Rachel>很显然表示他还爱着我
<7-4,Rachel>That obviously means he still loves me!

164
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,420
<7-4,Rachel>不信就算了  我绝对没误会
<7-4,Rachel>Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.

165
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,780
<7-4,Rachel>你们要不要下楼喝一杯
<7-4,Rachel>Do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?

166

<7-15,Rachel>Well, Ross said my name.

176
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,240
<7-16,Phoebe>我知道  不过他是无心的
<7-16,Phoebe>I know. But I don't think that means anything.

177
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,770
<7-16,Phoebe>菲比  这样吧
<7-16,Phoebe>Okay, Phoebe, you know what?

178
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,940
<7-17,Rachel>我们冷静客观地想想看
<7-17,Rachel>Let's look at this objectively, all right.

179
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,620
<7-17,Rachel>高一那年
<7-17,Rachel>Ninth grade, right?

180
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,250
<7-17,Rachel>他就疯狂迷上了我
<7-17,Rachel>The obsession starts, all right?

181
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,360
<7-17,Rachel>高一暑假
<7-17,Rachel>Summer after ninth grade,

182
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,580
<7-17,Rachel>他头一次看我穿两件式泳衣
<7-17,Rachel>he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.

183
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,090
<7-17,Rachel>更是不可自拔爱上我
<7-17,Rachel>His obsession begins to grow, right?

<8-5,Joey>No, you don't. I just saw you go in there with Monica.

191
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,900
<8-6,Chandler>我们在里面聊天
<8-6,Chandler>Well, we're hanging out in here.

192
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,080
<8-7,Joey>你说我们谁有机会上床
<8-7,Joey>Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?

193
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,410
<8-8,Chandler>看来我只能说是你了
<8-8,Chandler>Well, I suppose I would have to say you.

194
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,910
<8-8,Chandler>-我们要是想看电影呢  -是的
<8-8,Chandler>- What if we're watching a movie in here? - Which we are!

199
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,120
<9-1,Monica>你确定这样好吗
<9-1,Monica>You really think this is okay?

200
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,230
<9-2,Chandler>反正罗斯跟艾蜜莉也用不到
<9-2,Chandler>Well, Ross and Emily aren't going to use it.

201
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,730
<9-3,Monica>这里好漂亮
<9-3,Monica>Oh, it's so beautiful!

202
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,530
<9-3,Monica>可是我总觉得不太妥当
<9-3,Monica>I don't feel right about this.

203
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,610
<9-4,Chandler>莫妮卡听我说

<9-4,Chandler>房间期待着性爱
<9-4,Chandler>The room expects sex.

206

<9-4,Chandler>如果没有  这间房一定很失望
<9-4,Chandler>The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.

207
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,450
<9-4,Chandler>在其它蜜月套房面前抬不起头
<9-4,Chandler>All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.

212
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,830
<9-11,Chandler>你一定漏掉了什么地方  否则早就找到了
<9-11,Chandler>You couldn't have looked everywhere, or else you would've found her.

213
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,770
<9-13,Chandler>-你应该继续找  -大概再找个三十分钟

<9-16,Ross>她想找我也找不到  因为我跑来跑去的
<9-16,Ross>she's trying to find me but couldn't, because I kept moving around.

218
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,220
<9-16,Ross>从现在开始我不动了
<9-16,Ross>From now on, I'm staying in one place.

<10-5,Mr. Waltham>Nope.

238
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,870
<10-6,Mrs. Waltham>不用找她了  她没来
<10-6,Mrs. Waltham>You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.

239
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,060
<10-7,Mr. Waltham>我们来拿她的东西
<10-7,Mr. Waltham>We've come for her things.

240
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,600
<10-8,Ross>她在哪里
<10-8,Ross>Where is she?

241
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
<10-9,Mr. Waltham>她躲起来了  因为她很丢脸
<10-9,Mr. Waltham>She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated.

242
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,650
<10-9,Mr. Waltham>这辈子都不想再见到你
<10-9,Mr. Waltham>She doesn't want to see you ever again.

243
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,440
<10-10,Mrs. Waltham>很遗憾你们两个闹成这样  兔崽子
<10-10,Mrs. Waltham>We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.

244
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,750
<10-10,Mrs. Waltham>不过你实在是秀色可餐
<10-10,Mrs. Waltham>But I think you're absolutely delicious!

245
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,490
<10-11,Mr. Waltham>抱歉  我人还站在这里呢
<10-11,Mr. Waltham>Excuse me, I'm standing right here.

247
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,460
<10-12,Mrs. Waltham>阴魂不散
<10-12,Mrs. Waltham>There you are.

248
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,300
<10-13,Rachel>大家动作快  外面还有一车
<10-13,Rachel>You guys hurry up! Get some! There's a whole cart outside.

249
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,570
<10-14,Mr. Waltham>再见了  盖勒
<10-14,Mr. Waltham>Goodbye, Geller.

250
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,710
<10-15,Ross>等一下  别走
<10-15,Ross>Now, hold on. Hold on.

251
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,610
<10-15,Ross>听我说  令媛跟我
<10-15,Ross>Look, look. Your daughter and I

253
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,520
<10-15,Ross>请你转告她  我会去机场
<10-15,Ross>You tell her I'm gonna be at that airport,

254
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,830
<10-15,Ross>我希望她也会去
<10-15,Ross>and I hope she will be there too.

255
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,920
<10-15,Ross>我说了瑞秋的名字  但这只是无心之过
<10-15,Ross>I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, okay?

256
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,910
<10-15,Ross>她不过是我的朋友  仅此而已
<10-15,Ross>She's just a friend. That's all!

257
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,040
<10-15,Ross>请转告艾蜜莉  我爱她
<10-15,Ross>Just tell Emily I love her and...

258
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,500
<10-15,Ross>我只想跟她共度余生
<10-15,Ross>...I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.

259
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,670
<10-15,Ross>求你了  请保证一定会转告她
<10-15,Ross>Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
<10-16,Mr. Waltham>好吧  我会告诉她
<10-16,Mr. Waltham>All right, I'll tell her.

261
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,240
<10-16,Mr. Waltham>走吧  臭婆娘
<10-16,Mr. Waltham>Come on, bugger face!

262
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,070
<10-17,Mrs. Waltham>打电话给我
<10-17,Mrs. Waltham>Call me.

263
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,120
<10-18,Mr. Waltham>你也一天到晚待在厕所
<10-18,Mr. Waltham>You spend your half life in the bathroom.

264
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,270
<10-18,Mr. Waltham>怎么就不会从窗户滚蛋
<10-18,Mr. Waltham>Why do you never go out the bloody window?

265
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,200
<11-1,Monica>或许我们不再上床才对
<11-1,Monica>You know, maybe it's best we never got to do it again.

266
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,900
<11-2,Chandler>否则那晚就不特别了
<11-2,Chandler>Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.

267
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,960
<11-2,Chandler>理论上讲我们还在国际海域上
<11-2,Chandler>You know technically, we still are over international waters.

268
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,030
<11-3,Monica>我去洗手间
<11-3,Monica>I'm going to the bathroom.

269
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,250
<11-3,Monica>-待会来找我  -好的
<11-3,Monica>- Maybe I'll see you there in a bit? - Okay.

270
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,580
<11-5,Joey>我可以问个问题吗
<11-5,Joey>Can I ask you something?

271
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,890
<11-6,Chandler>不行
<11-6,Chandler>No.

272
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,120
<11-7,Joey>我昨晚跟费丽西蒂一起看《我的巨人》
<11-7,Joey>Felicity and I we were watched My Giant-

273
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,670
<11-7,Joey>我心想
<11-7,Joey>And I was thinking:

274
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,150
<11-7,Joey>自己永远不可能演得跟那个巨人一样棒
<11-7,Joey>"I'll never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."

275
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,010
<11-7,Joey>我执着于当演员是不是浪费时间呢
<11-7,Joey>Do you think I'm wasting my life with this acting thing?

276
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,280
<11-8,Chandler>不
<11-8,Chandler>No.

277
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,660
<11-9,Joey>那个巨人大概比我小五岁
<11-9,Joey>I mean, the giant's like five years younger than me.

278
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,940
<11-9,Joey>我有办法跟他一样优秀吗
<11-9,Joey>You know? You think I'll ever get there?

279
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,890
<11-10,Chandler>是
<11-10,Chandler>Yes.

280
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,950
<11-11,Joey>-谢了  -不客气
<11-11,Joey>- Thanks, man. - Okay, man.

281
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,150
<11-13,Joey>但是他比我高好多啊
<11-13,Joey>But what about how much taller he is than me?

282
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,080
<11-14,Joey>我现在已经不可能再长高了
<11-14,Joey>I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, you know.

283
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,400
<11-14,Joey>以后科学怎么发展又有谁知道呢
<11-14,Joey>Who knows what science will come up with in the future...

284
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,670
<11-14,Joey>钱德勒
<11-14,Joey>...but Chandler

285
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,840
<11-14,Joey>如果我死时  只是一个普通身高的小人物呢
<11-14,Joey>what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?

286
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,800
<11-15,Joey>莫妮卡  你上厕所上了半个小时
<11-15,Joey>Hi, Monica, you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

287
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,570
<11-16,Monica>我知道
<11-16,Monica>I know!

288
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,560
<11-17,Joey>你也吃了牛肉啊
<11-17,Joey>Had the beef tips, huh?

289
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,190
<12-3,Joey>你吃过肉了
<12-3,Joey>You ate meat!

290
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,400
<12-4,Phoebe>你(们)上床了
<12-4,Phoebe>You had sex!

291
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,010
<12-5,Chandler>我们才没有
<12-5,Chandler>No, we didn't.

292
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,560
<12-6,Phoebe>我知道你没有  我说的是莫妮卡
<12-6,Phoebe>I know you didn't. I was talking about Monica.

293
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,650
<12-7,Monica>菲比  我才没跟人上床呢
<12-7,Monica>Phoebe, I did not have sex.

294
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,220
<12-8,Phoebe>怀孕害我灵力不强了
<12-8,Phoebe>This pregnancy is throwing me all off.

295
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,290
<12-9,Joey>-我要去跟阿鸡阿鸭打招呼  -我也去
<12-9,Joey>- I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck. - Me too!

296
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,050
<12-10,Phoebe>你何必去
<12-10,Phoebe>Why would you need to say hi?

297
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,990
<12-11,Joey>你已经喂了它们四天了
<12-11,Joey>You've been feeding them for four days.

298
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,040
<12-12,Phoebe>没错  我回家好了
<12-12,Phoebe>Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.

299
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,760
<12-13,Monica>只剩下我们两个了
<12-13,Monica>We certainly are alone.

300
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,300
<12-14,Chandler>是的  幸好我们说好回纽约就不行
<12-14,Chandler>Yes. Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.

301
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,550
<12-14,Chandler>没错
<12-14,Chandler>Right.

302
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,060
<12-15,Monica>你看  既然说到这个
<12-15,Monica>Listen, since we're on that subject...

303
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,570
<12-15,Monica>我想告诉你
<12-15,Monica>...I just wanted to tell you that...

304
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,250
<12-15,Monica>当时我在伦敦心情很不好
<12-15,Monica>I was going through a really hard time in London...

305
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,970
<12-15,Monica>因为我哥结婚
<12-15,Monica>...what with my brother getting married

306
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,520
<12-15,Monica>-别人还把我认作是他妈  -没错
<12-15,Monica>- and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother. - Right.

307
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,010
<12-17,Monica>不过  无论如何
<12-17,Monica>Well, anyway, I just...

308
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,710
<12-17,Monica>那晚对我来说意义非凡  我要谢谢你
<12-17,Monica>That night meant a lot to me. I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.

309
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,530
<12-18,Chandler>那晚对我来说也是意义非凡
<12-18,Chandler>You know, that night meant a lot to me too.

310
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,860
<12-18,Chandler>并不是因为我也心情不好什么的
<12-18,Chandler>It wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.

311
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,330
<12-18,Chandler>我觉得很重要是因为  你太正点了
<12-18,Chandler>It just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot!

312
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,800
<12-18,Chandler>这样说可以吗
<12-18,Chandler>Is that okay?

313
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,340
<12-19,Monica>没关系
<12-19,Monica>That's okay.

<13-12,Ross>I just, I don't understand.

00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,740
<13-12,Ross>她怎么可以这样
<13-12,Ross>How could she do this?

335
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,340
<13-12,Ross>我是不是白痴  竟然以为她会来
<13-12,Ross>Am I like a complete idiot for thinking she'd actually show up?

336
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,810
<13-12,Ross>不
