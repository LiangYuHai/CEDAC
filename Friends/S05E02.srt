126
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,800
<3-11,Monica>你要是肯放下罗斯一分钟
<3-11,Monica>If you'd stop thinking about Ross for on minute...

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,230
<3-11,Monica>就会发现到处都有好男人
<3-11,Monica>...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.

128
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,460

232
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,700
<7-5,Monica>记得我们刚才讨论的  你要做的事吗
<7-5,Monica>Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?

233
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,610
<7-6,Rachel>-记得  -什么事
<7-6,Rachel>- Yes. - What thing?

234
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330
<7-7,Ross>是这样
<7-7,Ross>Well...

235
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,730
<7-8,Monica>瑞秋要去上摇摆舞班
<7-8,Monica>Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.

236
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,930
<7-8,Monica>我觉得是个蠢主意
<7-8,Monica>Which I think is a really stupid idea.

237
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
<7-8,Monica>很危险  她的目的永远达不到
<7-8,Monica>It's dangerous. She's never going to get what she wants.

238
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,500
<7-8,Monica>而且搞不好她还会伤到人
<7-8,Monica>And who knows who she might end up hurting?

239
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,240
<7-9,Ross>莫妮卡说得对  摇摆舞是有点危险
<7-9,Ross>Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.

240
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,710
<7-9,Ross>我要打个电话
<7-9,Ross>I'm gonna use the phone.

241
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,920
<7-9,Ross>取消五只送给艾蜜莉的熊宝宝
<7-9,Ross>I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.

242
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,590
<7-9,Ross>否则熊宝宝难逃死劫
<7-9,Ross>My God! Think of the massacre.

243
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,850
<7-10,Rachel>我就是要说
<7-10,Rachel>I'm gonna do it.

244
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,890
<7-11,Monica>瑞秋  我知道你认为我疯了
<7-11,Monica>Rachel, okay. I know you think I'm crazy.

245
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,920
<7-11,Monica>但是在你告诉他之前
<7-11,Monica>Please before you tell him you love him,

246
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,220
<7-11,Monica>至少找到一个
<7-11,Monica>just try to find one person...

247
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,760
<7-11,Monica>支持你的人  我打赌你找不到
<7-11,Monica>...who thinks it's a good idea. Because I bet you can't.

248
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,060
<7-12,Rachel>-但我...  -拜托
<7-12,Rachel>- But I... - Please?

249
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,600
<7-14,Rachel>好吧
<7-14,Rachel>All right. Fine.

250
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,110

<8-4,Joey>how you didn't get to go to London...

256
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,790
<8-4,Joey>-觉得自己被大家遗弃了  -是的
<8-4,Joey>- ...and you were feeling left out? - Yeah.

257
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,820
<8-6,Joey>我们很愧疚  所以
<8-6,Joey>Well, we all felt really bad about that... So,

258
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,490
<8-6,Joey>我们决定大家一起去旅行
<8-6,Joey>we decided we should all take a little trip together!

266
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,440
<8-11,Phoebe>那根本不算旅行  我刚从公园过来
<8-11,Phoebe>That's not a trip! I just came from the park.

267
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,230
<8-11,Phoebe>烂中央公园有什么值得击掌庆祝的
<8-11,Phoebe>What'll we gonna high-five about at the stupid Central Park?

<9-16,Rachel>You know what? I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.

298
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,510
<9-17,Monica>瑞秋  没有人支持你  所以你不能说
<9-17,Monica>No. Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.

299
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,880
<9-18,Rachel>知道吗  无所谓
<9-18,Rachel>You know what? That doesn't matter.

300
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,950
<9-19,Monica>瑞秋
<9-19,Monica>Okay, Rachel.

<9-19,Monica>Do you have any idea know how painful it is

302
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,860
<9-19,Monica>回应你的爱意  你会有多痛苦吗
<9-19,Monica>to tell someone you love them and not have them say it back?

303
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,660
<9-20,Rachel>我不在乎
<9-20,Rachel>I don't care.

304
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,820
<9-20,Rachel>好吧

<9-25,Ross>Okay.

311
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,810
<9-26,Rachel>罗斯  听我说
<9-26,Rachel>Ross you know what,

312
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,400
<9-26,Rachel>我得告诉你一件事
<9-26,Rachel>there's something I have to talk to you about.

313
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,270
<9-26,Rachel>虽然大家都叫我别说
<9-26,Rachel>Everyone's been saying I shouldn't tell you.

314
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,370
<9-26,Rachel>但我觉得他们都错了  是人就会犯错
<9-26,Rachel>But I think they're wrong. You know how people can be wrong.

315
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,240
<9-27,Ross>当然了  有一次上班时
<9-27,Ross>Sure. Once at work...

316
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,690
<9-27,Ross>我说放射性碳测定法太过时了
<9-27,Ross>...I thought carbon dating is fossilized...

317
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,080
<9-28,Rachel>罗斯  我说正经的
<9-28,Rachel>Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.

318
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,880
<9-31,Ross>说吧
<9-31,Ross>Go ahead.

319
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,590
<9-32,Rachel>我这就说了
<9-32,Rachel>I think I'm just going to say it.

320
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,330
<9-32,Rachel>现在就告诉你
<9-32,Rachel>I'm just going to say it.

321
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,570
<9-32,Rachel>我还爱着你  罗斯
<9-32,Rachel>I'm still in love with you, Ross.

322
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,900
<9-33,Ross>我不知道现在该怎么回答
<9-33,Ross>I'm not sure what to do with that right now.

323
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,570
<9-34,Ross>怎么了  你跟我开玩笑吗  那就太恶劣了
<9-34,Ross>What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.

324
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,470
<9-35,Rachel>我很正经
<9-35,Rachel>I'm so dead serious!

325
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,610
<9-35,Rachel>不能再正经了
<9-35,Rachel>I'm totally serious!

326
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,110
<9-36,Ross>那你笑什么
<9-36,Ross>Why are you laughing?

327
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,750
<9-37,Rachel>因为我刚听到自己的话
<9-37,Rachel>Because I just heard it!

328
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,020
<9-37,Rachel>我听到了  而且觉得很荒谬
<9-37,Rachel>I heard it. And it's ridiculous!

329
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,380
<9-42,Ross>我是说
<9-42,Ross>I mean...

330
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,850
<9-43,Rachel>你已经结婚了
<9-43,Rachel>You're married!

331
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,560
<9-37,Rachel>你结婚了  太荒谬了  就像...
<9-37,Rachel>You're married, and it's just ridiculous! It's like...

332
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,300
<9-37,Rachel>我说话的时候  似乎灵魂出窍了
<9-37,Rachel>When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.

333
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,330
<9-37,Rachel>然后我的灵魂听到肉身说话
<9-37,Rachel>And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...

334
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,470
<9-37,Rachel>灵魂认为自己实在很白痴
<9-37,Rachel>I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

335
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,080
<9-38,Ross>-我的确已经结婚了  -我知道
<9-38,Ross>- Well, I am married. - I know.

336
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,880
<9-38,Ross>虽然婚礼后就没跟老婆说过话
<9-38,Ross>Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.

337
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,590
<9-39,Rachel>抱歉  这不好笑
<9-39,Rachel>I'm sorry. That's not funny.

338
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,050
<9-40,Ross>其实还蛮好笑的
<9-40,Ross>Actually, it kind of is.

339
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,860
<9-40,Ross>我老婆不回我电话
<9-40,Ross>My wife won't return my calls.

340
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,430
<9-40,Ross>我不知道我老婆在哪里
<9-40,Ross>I don't know where my wife is.

341
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,870
<9-40,Ross>"罗斯  你老婆呢"  我也不知道
