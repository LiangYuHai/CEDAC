<2-7,Joey>我乔伊最爱做这种事了
<2-7,Joey>That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.

62
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,420
<2-8,Phoebe>公共广播公司
<2-8,Phoebe>Oh, PBS!

<2-9,Monica>-他们哪里不对了  -他们哪里对
<2-9,Monica>- What's wrong with PBS? - What's right with them?

64
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,390
<2-11,Joey>你为何不喜欢公共广播公司  菲比
<2-11,Joey>Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?

65
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,160
<2-12,Phoebe>因为我妈自杀之后
<2-12,Phoebe>Right after my Mom killed herself,

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,730
<2-12,Phoebe>我一个人非常难过
<2-12,Phoebe>I was in a bad place, you know, personally.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,860
<2-12,Phoebe>所以我想写信给芝麻街
<2-12,Phoebe>I just thought it'll make me feel better

68
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,930
<2-12,Phoebe>心情应该会好一点
<2-12,Phoebe>if I'd write to Sesame Street-

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,110
<2-12,Phoebe>因为我小时候总觉得他们很亲切
<2-12,Phoebe>'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid.

70
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,000
<2-12,Phoebe>结果根本没人回信
<2-12,Phoebe>No one ever wrote back.

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,040
<2-13,Chandler>你要知道那些布偶没有大拇指
<2-13,Chandler>You know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.

72
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,130
<2-14,Phoebe>我只收到一个烂钥匙扣
<2-14,Phoebe>All I got was a lousy key chain,

73
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,240
<2-14,Phoebe>拜托  我那时住在纸箱里耶
<2-14,Phoebe>and by that time, I was living in a box.

74
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,150
<2-14,Phoebe>连钥匙都没有
<2-14,Phoebe>I didn't have keys!

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,520
<2-15,Joey>我很遗憾  菲比
<2-15,Joey>I'm sorry, Pheebs.

76
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,090
<2-15,Joey>我只是想做好事  就像你帮你弟弟生小孩
<2-15,Joey>I just wanted to do a good deed, like you did with the babies.

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,660
<2-16,Phoebe>你才不是做好事
<2-16,Phoebe>This isn't a good deed.

78
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,630
<2-16,Phoebe>你只是想上电视  根本就很自私
<2-16,Phoebe>You just want to get on TV. This is totally selfish.

79
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,860
<2-17,Joey>你帮你弟弟生小孩又怎么说
<2-17,Joey>What about you having those babies for your brother?

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,660
<2-18,Phoebe>自私的不是只有我
<2-18,Phoebe>Talking about selfish!

81
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,370
<2-18,Phoebe>你胡说什么
<2-18,Phoebe>What are you talking about?

82
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,130
<2-19,Joey>你的确是帮了他们
<2-19,Joey>It was a really nice thing,

83
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,810
<2-19,Joey>不过你自己心情也很好吧
<2-19,Joey>but it made you feel good, right?

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
<2-20,Phoebe>那又如何
<2-20,Phoebe>Yeah, so?

85
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,140
<2-21,Joey>让自己心情好的好事  就算是一种自私
<2-21,Joey>It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,780
<2-21,Joey>世界上根本就没有无私的好事  太遗憾了
<2-21,Joey>Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry.

87
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,720
<2-22,Phoebe>有的  有很多行善的人都没有私心
<2-22,Phoebe>Yes, there are. there are totally good deeds that are selfless!

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,790
<2-23,Joey>你能举出个例子来吗
<2-23,Joey>May I ask for one example?

89
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,860
<2-24,Phoebe>当然有  例如
<2-24,Phoebe>Yeah, it's... You know, there's...

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,830
<2-24,Phoebe>不  我不给你举例
<2-24,Phoebe>No, you may not!

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,690
<2-25,Joey>因为所有人都是自私的
<2-25,Joey>Because all people are selfish.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,900
<2-26,Phoebe>你说我自私吗
<2-26,Phoebe>Are you calling me selfish?

93
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,500
<2-26,Phoebe>你难道不是人吗
<2-26,Phoebe>Are you calling you people?

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,450
<2-27,Joey>菲比  很抱歉戳破你的美梦
<2-27,Joey>Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,

95
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,780
<2-27,Joey>但世界上没有无私的善事
<2-27,Joey>but selfless good deeds don't exist, okay?

96
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,150
<2-27,Joey>你也知道圣诞老人的那套把戏吧
<2-27,Joey>You know the deal on Santa Claus, right?

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,880
<2-28,Phoebe>我一定会找到一件无私的善事
<2-28,Phoebe>I'm gonna find a selfless good deed.

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,800

<5-1,Phoebe>我竟然找不到一件无私的善行
<5-1,Phoebe>I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.

160
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,230
<5-1,Phoebe>你们知道我家隔壁那个老头吧
<5-1,Phoebe>You know that old guy that lives next door to me?

161
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,800
<5-1,Phoebe>我偷溜到他家  帮他打扫前廊的落叶
<5-1,Phoebe>I snuck over there and raked up the leaves on his front stoop.

<5-1,Phoebe>他捉到我之后  强迫我喝饮料吃饼干

<5-1,Phoebe>Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!

164
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,470
<5-2,Rachel>或许乔伊说得对
<5-2,Rachel>Maybe Joey's right.

165
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,410
<5-2,Rachel>所有好事的出发点都有私心
<5-2,Rachel>Maybe all good deeds are selfish.

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,750
<5-3,Phoebe>我一定要找到一件无私的善行
<5-3,Phoebe>I will find a selfless good deed.

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,120

<5-3,Phoebe>I just gave birth to three children...

168
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,150
<5-3,Phoebe>不能让他们在乔伊有理的世界里长大
<5-3,Phoebe>...and I won't let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!

169

<6-11,Ross>-你尽管说  -你要知道
<6-11,Ross>- Yes, tell me. - You have to understand...

204
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,190
<6-12,Emily>在我的亲朋好友面前

210
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,770
<6-16,Emily>我光想到你跟她共处一室就快气坏了
<6-16,Emily>It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her.

211
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,280
<6-17,Ross>艾蜜莉  我跟瑞秋根本没什么

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,740
<7-1,Ross>我就问艾蜜莉愿不愿意来纽约
<7-1,Ross>I asked Emily if she would come to New York.

<7-8,Ross>How the hell am I supposed to make this kind of decision?

<11-4,Ross>待会再问  怎么回事

<12-5,Joey>You sure? Pheebs, after what Sesame Street did to you?

317
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,560
<12-6,Phoebe>我还是很生气  但是我知道

<12-6,Phoebe>我决定做件好事  不过我自己可不开心
<12-6,Phoebe>I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.

322
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,780

<12-7,Joey>You don't feel a little good about donating the money?

324
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,390
<12-8,Phoebe>难过死了  我本想用这笔钱买只仓鼠
<12-8,Phoebe>No, it sucks! I was saving up to buy a hamster.

325
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,690
<12-9,Joey>仓鼠  那种宠物十元就买得到
<12-9,Joey>A hamster? Those things are, like, $ 10.

<12-12,Phoebe>Look...

340
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,420

<13-1,Chandler>Maybe I got carried away before,

341
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,710
<13-1,Chandler>不过有件事要告诉你
<13-1,Chandler>but there's something you got to know.

342
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,410
<13-1,Chandler>如果我表现得很好  也是因为你
<13-1,Chandler>If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.

343
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,890
